Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran ’ s destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two states discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel ’ s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
Obama ’ s bid for the Iranian nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was sometimes considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call confesses Professor to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman that ever loved me." This stood according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police encircled him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal background.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that at the end of the 2014 academic year he had 15 to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university ’ s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb ’ s imagination. ”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, the police later found Lamb ’ s trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ’ home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He obtained his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lambs ’ long-standing friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar play for several years.
He was then the swarm of women.
All girls melted when he was there, "Hairston said, now living in 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I have killed my wife", but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Prentiss's husband, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed on a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played the one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes amusement coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were at cleanup and joking together.
I think they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester of the seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and of the Students ’ Committee.
On Tuesday evening at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight commemoration ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it won ’ t hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the Toy and Baby Products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centers across the country. 45,000 workers were employed during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel for the film that has ever been shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia ’ s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution ” of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN ’ s chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - in the margins of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in addressing the Syrian crisis in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey values that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn ’ t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in double-digit terms, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry ’ s leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush ’ s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump ’ s perseverance and beginning to let their dollars flow to topple him.
Here are some up-to-date survey values that indicate that Mogul ’ s real estate is not just a temporary phase:
Trump ’ s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth and University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw real estate as positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac polls in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of Netanyahu ’ s voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic ” or“ satisfied ” when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of ten say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they are “enthusiastic ” vs. 40% who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be “dissatisfied ” or“ upset ” if Jeb Bush, the establishment ’ s favorite, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump ’ s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters, tending to Republicans, believe that the real estate minister Mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to execute his office effectively, and almost six out of ten independent people say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholar hats, Republican voters consider Trump real.
When asked who is the most likely to win the nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of Trump ’ s campaign voters see as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth and University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head, Trump ’ s majority support reaps Trump ’ s head for Trump ’ s race with most other Republican candidates.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is a head-to-head-to-head-to-race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the Entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head and head and race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump ’ s supporters say that they have formed their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly cast their votes.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump ’ s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists ” in his election campaign two months ago, immigration has been the pivotal point in 2016 ’ s public discourse.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation.
But, according to Monday ’ s ABC / Post poll, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump appears to do so.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of Republican voters ’ support, especially through their outsiders ’ status.
Six out of ten Republicans say in the new Monday ’ s ABC / Post poll that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A poll conducted by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied ” and 21 percent“ hellish upset ”.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street a square meter of a thatched house costs 73,300 euros on average.
"The range of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student's office in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany ’ s top residential venues, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, note.
But good who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top.
Champions League: Bavaria ’ s dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goal shooters in Piraeus: Bavaria's star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deserved 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
A sovereign kick-off of the Champions League ’ s season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witchcraft of Piraeus.
The team of coaches of the Champions League won their kick-off game at the Greek Olympic Games in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller ’ s double pack (52. / 90. + 2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth start success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where the third attempt at the final is finally to bring the Henkelpott to Munich.
Müller received at his 28th place in the Champions League for the Bavarian Leadership benevolent assistance from Olympic goalie Roberto, who let pass a flanked shot of the World Champion.
"We won't underestimate them," said Bavaria's captain Philipp, before the match in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich kept word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home matches in the premier league, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1: 3).
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously, but often too recklessly to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to the left Douglas Costa, who rarely went through against the former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left gate.
In the 67th minute the World Champion awarded the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland ’ s front line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalie parked Roberto with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put needle stitches.
On goaltender Manuel Neuer was left.
For instance, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the bar (56.).
In front of the newcomer Netanyahu had a quadruple chain defended with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome, who did it well.
Mario Goetze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat out first.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something different from it, that is already malicious".
He also chose Kingsley Coman for the hit Lewandowski (59.) at the first change.
Gods came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another one on it by penalty.
Before the match it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially masked Bavarian supporters in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes, damages not only the lung, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: if you do not, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.5-3.6 mark higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, declared first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life time."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads according to our knowledge also to a good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains of Late Antiquity on the banks of Cologne ’ s Rhine
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological monument preservation.
In the third phase of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it had already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman has had an accident at the station in Geilenkirchen and Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning about 1.40 o'clock the woman crossed the tracks coming from the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, by capturing the train she carried the most serious injuries.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
There is no evidence to the investigating officials about the reason for the young woman crossing the tracks at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Local residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are asked.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided at the Federal Police ’ s 24-hour free hotline on 0800 / 6888000 or any other police station.
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute on the proposed TTIP transatlantic free trade agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private mediation mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its operation corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU and the US jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is planned for the first time.
It would allow an objection to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it claims that it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved.
The investor of the state arbitration (ISDS), which is particularly demanded by large corporations, is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice whereby companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, deflect national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In first statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), described the plans as major progress.
The Commission took into account key issues in the reform that Federal Economic Ministers Sigmar Gabriel had worked out with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is out of the table.
The French Government also welcomed the Malmström plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of action of the economy by too many new rules.
This could particularly disadvantage small and medium-sized enterprises.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.
A framework for the agreement should originally be in place at the end of this year.
This date is no longer durable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him stands a flipchart on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Stevens lecture.
He tells about various places he keeps drawing on the map, about which his meticulously and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", clever composed songs appear, which nestle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumour arises that "Michigan" is the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 US federal states should be sung in succession.
But already 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Stevens appears here reduced.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Trudeau oise") is a widely acclaimed masterpiece.
Excessive in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments Stevens then uses very extensive electronic sets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Escaping the smaller clubs for a long time, the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle from Neon and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark held hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture was "more opulent" and one could thus "throw away the record basically".
Only for an encore Stevens thanks modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and bows finally under thunderous applause.
Jeremy Netanyahu ’ s debut at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time
Since his election, Mr Netanyahu ’ s debut at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Trudeau, will make his debut at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time for the first time with David Cameron.
He will rise to ask the first of his six pre-determined questions shortly after noon, with the media likely to examine his performance and Labour deputies nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Netanyahu ’ s leadership, since it will be a member of the shadow cabinet after his appointment and at the TUC ’ s annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour leader ’ s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front pages.
Mr Netanyahu ’ s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Trudeau said he had "stood in a respectful silence" and he recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr Cohen ’ s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight ’ s program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, “regardless ” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Merkel ’ s top team, invoking differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, following Mr Netanyahu's statements on the position on the European Union and on limiting profits.
He said to the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Labour and Pensions Minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
He will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in parliament over the past decade, since he has been the Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time is too confrontational, and that it will refrain from both “clumsiness ” and fighting with barbs, and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
He has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Geschossen in Joburg ': Homeless young people trained as photographers

But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge (er-)) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and get a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose by leaps and bounds according to data indicating an increase in the UK ’ s wage growth, while SABMiller ’ s bid target increased the pound ’ s 100.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% over the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has been assessing the timing of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
With an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21, the index closed.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20% after taking over the offer of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the world ’ s two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry ’ s shares were 0.9% higher for Richemont luxury goods, according to encouraging news from the competition.
Richemont ’ s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are once again recording growth.
Shares of Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said that it had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline after Goldman Sachs had set its assessment for the company ’ s rating to “sell ”.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in der Hauptstadt: On Bieber's Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 Jahre jung, ein Hänfling mit oberschicker Frise.
The type with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin ’ s luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
Beaver's Construction: Here lives her idol, whose poster hangs up in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa earned in half a year.
If anything.
She says: "Actually my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the grammar school."
"I fulfill her a dream".
Compulsory schooling?
Who is itching?
The fans do not.
Not even Bieber himself.
That has already caused.
For the advertisement in the advertising break of the superbowls he three million, a two-year deal with an Anti Pickel company rinsed many, many dollars on Bieber ’ s account.
And with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others stress that Bieber is in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does so.
Plakat bringt Libanesen auf Kartoffeldöner * Idea
Potatoes or Döner?
Both are possible in the potato driver developed by Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "Potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
On the idea he was presented with a poster at a demonstration at the rally with the inscription "Kartoffeln statt Döner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer has been turning in his shop, equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has since been registered with the patent office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to betray how much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together", he finds.
Also with its customers the culinary international understanding arrives well.
Metcash Launches Ground-Standing Campaign to Combat Aldi- Incidence
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi rise in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-level campaign to defend the market share of IGA ’ s retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events like Adelaide and Show.
IGA dealer and supplier jump on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to loyal customers for the South Australian Football League.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets, and will remove sales from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley ’ s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA ’ s retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the amount of Metcash ’ s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA ’ s buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash ’ s turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA ’ s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash ’ s food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA ’ s retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to align selling prices with coles and woolworths for hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA ’ s retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash ’ s Managing Director Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and loading will boost momentum and hopes that the wholesaler will return to earnings growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves rather praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to the limelight by the infamous confrontation between him and Stan and the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, whereby Harrison exclaimed: "I should have beaten and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted Richard Gasquet ’ s US Open victory, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Championship semifinals against the UK.
"One thing about which I'm quite mature is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost due to a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Championships, even under the fairly provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a bit too strictly.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component. "
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around […]", said Healy.
And I believe that Nick quickly managed to rise, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I consider appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe ’ s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man ’ s country and reacted with outrage to Serbian officials.
The people who had fled violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia ’ s Foreign Minister said it was “unacceptable ” that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There will have to be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian border with Serbia came one day after the 28 nations were unable to agree a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the overrun of Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut off roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were engaged in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a serious bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is very contradictory to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws also establish higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree procedurally with the use of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a barbed wire train wagon had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push in there.
About 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ’ s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has support for 47% of democratic voters in primary elections (58% earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up 17%).
Vice-President Joe Blatter, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, receives support from 15% of the democratic voters in the primary elections.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is certain which candidates they will support.
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates.
Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups since CBS ’ s News poll, while Sanders scored some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these projections have diminished.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton ’ s advantage among democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the national primary elections say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and a further 15% would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six per cent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton ’ s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48% of Democratic voters in the primary elections say that they enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say this about their leader Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton ’ s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval for dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice-president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57% of the democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the primary elections are asked who would be their second election for the party, Berlusconi is in the lead.
From Clinton ’ s followers, more than half of them say that Netanyahu ’ s second election would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Berlusconi decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton ’ s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election, but that figure fell by 78 per cent last month.
∑ is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that regards him as the "most selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to those voters in the primary elections.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics among voters of their party ’ s primary elections.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders, and ∑ as honest and trustworthy, and with strong leadership qualities.
Netanyahu is best off in honesty with the three candidates, while Clinton ’ s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don ’ t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don ’ t think about him.
Democratic voters in primary elections generally see Clinton, Sanders, and ∑ ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a personal e-mail address and a server will continue to be asked during her term of office as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the primary elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall views.
But it is another story in the American public sphere as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton ’ s general opinion, although 36% said that her opinion had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party ’ s voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32% see her as honest and trustworthy, eight% less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
They do not consider 62 percent of those entitled to vote to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of voters across the country also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks on leadership.
Out of the six candidates tested, ∑, Carson, and Bush do best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honestly, but as with Carson, many don ’ t have any opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets up close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll closely behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of voters ’ support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. Support grows by 23% in the last CBS poll conducted prior to Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday ’ s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups, surpassing Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been knocked down with Netanyahu ’ s Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% last month ’ s support to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls – it lands with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found a few strokes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump ’ s belief.
“We need energy, ” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign ’ s Iowa appearance.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water is sufficient for bathing vacationers.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: the water in the North and Baltic this week has a maximum of 18 degrees, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
However, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a harassment ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders are filed against five people.
Members of New York ’ s Baruch College Pi -Delta -Psi -Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been burdened with an attached eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to approach a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi and Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and fundamentally put the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said Polizeichef Wagner.
He could not be revived, and the next morning he died of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with dull force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to hold the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve ’ s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank representatives have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
“The Fed ’ s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of“ cheap money, ” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to low levels to lead to seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend based look at how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market saw last month, anticipating interest rates can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset gains to be eroded 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy, ” said German banking analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed ’ s interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been on the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate increase, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis, which Bob Doll, chief plant Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on shares begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest-rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and could accelerate a recession.
What is extremely remarkable here is that GDP will be close to its lowest point with the Fed ’ s interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have taken the Fed ’ s interest rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes have been focused on the Federal Open Market Committee ’ s session this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures are only 25% likely to trade.
"In our study, all the cycles of increase from 1950 to the present day took place in a Super League cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and, very quickly after the beginning of the recovery, set before recession heights in the shadows," the report says.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far 74 months.
Firm income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rise in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
For bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab ’ s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest-bearing bonds often yield better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields, ” said Kathy Jones, Fixed and Income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the Fed ’ s strategy of expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has risen – all of the market ’ s characteristics when the Fed intensifies its strategy.
On the whole, companies that manage the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that" Quality "stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have, on average, surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet by 5 percentage points after each of the interest-rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) on average.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "dumbing"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC broadcaster Bossen that the public broadcaster was "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you are actually just imitating what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And I think the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that work must be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC ’ s production that, during the hearing in the Committee for the Choice of Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to kick off the commercial rival.
The Tory deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 premier show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC fashion".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" when it starts an entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future, or to spend the payer's money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales slowed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain ’ s major shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and decrease until 2000, then this has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience growth diminishing.
The BlackFriday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealers dropped websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending a little more than £1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially weighs on the collapse of the huge Saudi bin dealer group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca ’ s Grand Mosque.
The mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the Holy Site, where only days before a crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already made a firm commitment that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin's shop group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden Group was jointly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman pledged to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane, which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which later this month.
The Bin ‑ Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not up-to-date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca ’ s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin and Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia ’ s ruling family for decades and undertakes major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son expropriated by the family in the 1990 ’ s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) should be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This means that 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Head of the Daily Mail Correspondent
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
After all, the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do do-it-yourselfers jobs in their homes, according to the CEO of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been overtaken.
Therefore Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B & Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men predominate among the employees.
She said that it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households, which are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "A majority of men are still working in our stores.
We must shift this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect on an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and sales after the group shoulder the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich / Dob officials in court for infidelity
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice champion Aich / Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion at the regional court in Klagenfurt.
The accused were not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from the accounts they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
This fact expired the chairman of the Schöffensenats, judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later stage.
As to the denial of infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time incurred an asset disadvantage.
The sports functionaries would have charged only compensation for expenditure and brought out the sports club, for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to about 600,000 Schilling (approx. 44,000 Euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or do we block it?", one of the defendants said, in the bread profession, large company auditors of the tax office.
He then decided with his colleague and co-defendant to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have advanced money, put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said during the interrogation.
It was agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, the payment of the reimbursement of expenses had been decided retroactively until 1991, if financial success had been achieved.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore also lump-sum and not detail-debiting appeared, the former chairman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments were not disclosed to the club in detail.
The association had not in detail interested in the financial development, only the debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When an official started investigating the abuse of office in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club account.
The defendants explained that these were reserves.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages".
Why compensation?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
Thereupon the first defendant declared that he did not agree with this wording, because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor".
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never received a cent salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He had invoiced 1,000 euros per month for diets, but he added that the actual expenditure had been much higher.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be found by the accused.
They explained that they had not been kept after an audit in which everything had been judged to be correct.
The second defendant had also received mileage allowance.
All remedies were made in cash, for which he had to go from his place of residence to the international market to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett's Packard Strikes Another 30,000 Jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split.
The vacancies in the US computer giants Hewlett and Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group is planning to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion) of costs, the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will start in the fourth quarter.
The dismantling of 55,000 jobs, which has been underway for three years, has not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal year 2013 / 14, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
After the stock exchange, Hewlett's Packard share yielded 2.3 percent.
Palo Alto, a group of printers from Palo Alto in California, is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently became the world ’ s second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
Sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent in the third quarter of July.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
The proceeds thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split up and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman only reacted late to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq, however, would be largely opposed: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al Assad is against 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent of whom would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The trade fair will focus on networked, self-propelled cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organisers of the VDA Association of Cars expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence at Serbian border of Hungary
The Hungarian police deployed tear gas and water cannons on the Serbian border against several hundred refugees.
Euronew's correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police a water cannon was ready.
From 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first continuously used pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
Much tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortages of breath.
The Serbian police spokesman also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A poll among 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who thought last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and hold interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero zone and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
Deathman at Delta State University Leave Excuse Letters
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "he could make it happen", authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10: 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot at someone, and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, but he will "not disturb anyone", but will probably be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman I ever loved. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb ’ s imagination. ”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he will not go to prison".
When police caught him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life's wool indicates on the website of the university.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also allegedly has to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 executives worldwide will cost the group ’ s conversion to the workplace.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a Management Board for the passenger business.
The low-cost Eurowings airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the executive team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the new edition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective agreement with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday following the legal strike.
That was what the union said.
The subject of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible "in one year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
Background is beside the transitional supply of the pilots the saving concept "Wings".
Lufthansa plans to outsource routes to the Group ’ s own low-cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester ’ s Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
In the changing room he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty card and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw ’ s account was: “Thank you all for your news. Words can ’ t describe how broken I am, my path to recovery now begins, I come back stronger. ”
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
Talking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad. I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a fouling game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won't take long for you to know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favourite child book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss ’ s environmental flaw, which appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 version of the film, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. Dr. Seuss was a love interest, whose real name was Theodor Seuss's hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed and Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-felling, Thneed knitting Once -ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a squatting, bearded being "speaking in the name of the trees".
Such a relatively low PR task was most likely delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Netanyahu Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron ’ s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron ’ s staff, but gave no more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England ’ s team, but it ’ s still hard
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 Test Series is not on my card.
I would not exclude a away victory.
Alastair Cook ’ s page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting ’ s lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won ’ t wear scars from 2012, just a youthful ’ s positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are geared to results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection.
A long time ago one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
I hope that if he strikes out more races for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team ’ s husband.
The question of how much time a test is given to a drummer to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only reproach that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a drummer I highly appreciate.
He is an X ’ factor ’ s cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us in a Trent Bridge place, which hit us a lot.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but this depends, of course, on the team setup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of making Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, emerged, and I have nothing against it.
I don ’ t see why a drummer can ’ t beat there, and this left-handed player has already shown that he is a vicious hit by cricket.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He immediately managed three hundred runs and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spinning that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket championship, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with what has been said.
Grey ’ s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One ’ s Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions will not be made lightly.
Brexit (Brexit = Britain ’ s exit from the EU) could gain ground if the economy fell into a slump by 2017
David Cameron ’ s outrageous renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper and deeper every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy, “Is it yes or no? ” – the leader of Labour or the TUC, who fought heavily on Tuesday for Europe.
Foreigners also have their coaches and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own fault, are fed up with Britain ’ s self-made agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don ’ t want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that it does not like them if they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.
Prime Minister and finance minister climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Germany ’ s cautious Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exaggerated long endurance of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France ’ s François Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain has a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will take one leg to help the Selfie UK, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want, either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful comments, in SNP style, while Britain ’ s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate Brexit is suspected by my friend.
"The renegotiation was a default" and "Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense, and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, but they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the brass Euro and opportunists, who made a name for himself as an "EU Just Bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all his madness, he knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing rogues, telephone hackers foreigners, and the pseudo non-German countries that own most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought about them in a similar way, but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Blair was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron ’ s referendum whirl, because Blair had put the principle of the unapproved EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door to him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Netanyahu, who gave me a friendly flap on my back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn't need any time to waste for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott politik of the 80's, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC ’ s sofa he left on Sunday.
The official position on Europe is - I say it kindly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip ’ s traditional blue-dye tendency and the wilder realms of Tory ’ s Klein ’ s Engländerismus can probably say yes.
It is what Hilary said this week, "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television, when the scout fought in him not to admit that the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea as a shadow chancellor.
It reminded me of the 70 ’ s when his old father tried on television to be unfaithful to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MEPs after all the reports at their Monday night cloisters.
Whatever the touching bottom of the image of the artist wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vortex of the social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to take Labours support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell ’ s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with her Bennite Siege Economy, her anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory Government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of what British Influence Security Forum called itself.
Experts criticize report from Public Health England on E and cigarettes
Researchers said that claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multiple criteria for decision-making analysis (Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the damage of various nicotine containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors were previously expected to receive funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarettes manufacturer, but did not add the funding they reported to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarettes champions, some of which also indicate an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE ’ s tobacco management.
The research work of the group "confesses" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "so far there has been no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-Being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been reacted to beforehand.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifetime smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that, by comparison, the health risks of e-cigarettes are low, but that we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a disease related to smoking every year, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit penalty shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcaster.
He criticized the BBC for placing publicly legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-contested time windows against their rivals ’ most popular shows and broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC ’ s Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC will commission or broadcast programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals, ” Johnson told the Supreme House ’ s Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programmes that others do not do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I do not see why a regressive tax finances programs that could be financed even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm.
I try to see how this should be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews “because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. ”
His comments on the BBC ’ s most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his MacTaggart ’ s 2003 Edinburgh lecture that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more publicly-legal niches should go to BBC4 where you can ’ t quite measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of radio charges, “Well, of course, we ’ ve created all those obscure programs that no one has seen. ”
They put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Regarding the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a rather regressive system in terms of who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think we all think that you get a great value here for £150 per year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, I wonder if that ’ s true, because they don ’ t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 leader David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian ’ s mission to “inform, educate, and entertain. ”
He said that little of the BBC ’ s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV ’ s production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example to the public broadcaster ’ s legal television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in “inform, educate and entertain ”.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneurons and cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the Deep-brain stimulation, an invasive method that releases electrical impulses into people ’ s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP4 and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP and 4 Ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The method has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency and ultrasonic waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The Indicators Shame Britain ’ s Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Defense Weapons Trade Fairs Watch Video.
Terrible murderers and drones!
Foot joint shattering legties!
Scatter bombs!
And electric batons that cause pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this announcement for the world ’ s largest arms show is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the UK government ’ s willingness to fuse weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London ’ s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the U-Bahn trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground typefaces and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into a picture of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms show.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of Allen keys claiming that "access to about a third of the bus stops will gain advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another anti-weapon trade poster greets the commuters in the U-Bahn.
Amnesty ’ s video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP ’ s creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair – through a vacancy of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let ’ s give them the campaign they ’ re trying to avoid. ”
They played with the invention of a more realistic twisted corporate advertising, but "by tapping with bright colors and animation it remains more attached."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Weapons Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors fuse fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army to "the shoulder shot AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding retroactive effects within the target."
Whatever that does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten nineteen-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in Beret ’ s and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I was annoyed with - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-racking to absolutely frightening.
It ’ s tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to and why you “honestly Marmite neither love nor hate because seriously, guys, it ’ s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I ’ m in my room. ”
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People ’ s rooms are often transformed into drinks and receptions, film and night venues and communal meeting places, but they are also places where people dress and dress their underwear.
Regarding this: Do not think about starting at the university with a relationship
Introverted receive coarse treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space of space and space that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I get back the energy I have spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by sociability - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
As you start the university at the height of the Back Manie, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when they knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
When someone steals your things, that is annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my fellow inhabitant who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should make no noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent person, but of being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if it meant something to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep another two hours before she let their own music grope, shut off her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to enter the same student residence by chance?
Conversely, it would not be completely embarrassing if you consider a fellow resident to be your future spouse, to get on with her, to separate herself again, and then to see her every day and perhaps to experience how she covers all her friends with her?
Of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try at least to tell your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
Give by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never spoil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door, and put her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not tack her possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the central Franconian corner valley for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees, for example - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the alone mother and the low-earner."
"I show how you can still build cheap and well today," says the 44 year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly inexpensive housing can be created: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people remain here to a large extent.
With the flow of refugees in mind, we will need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you accommodate the people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro, without land.
This is manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have correctly traversed my project.
Particularly complicated it always makes the impending Damoklesschwert special construction and the parking space regulation.
Creepy.
It is still assumed who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But don ’ t you tighten the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.
I show how you can still build cheap and well today.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone ’ s operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message telling that the "Software Update failed".
To bypass the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is recharged during the upgrade or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and could cause the update to be terminated.

You should also make sure that you have browsed our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's Only Curse: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The second round of the World Cup stressed "that I have nothing to lose" before the start into the decisive seven overseas races.
53 points separate the Vice World Champion from defending champion and double Champion Hamilton this Sunday before the Singapore night race.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also tackles the flood lights of the Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
2009 and last year the 30-year-old Brit won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing its membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a cure.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Bundesverdienstkreuzes 1. class and honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Red White" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quartiersbüro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf Stauffenberg.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically to the Count of Stauffenberg.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, seniors and advice seekers receive information about questions such as care insurance or benefits of the health and care funds.
For years we have been using our outpatient care service to find that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also many benefits of the coffers are not frequently taken up, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood still", explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the business department Altenhilfe.
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis were taken into the boat.
Therefore one can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other ideally.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Centre for Care and Care".
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city center particularly in demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined during the inauguration ceremonies, the district office also devotes itself to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social get-together".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division of Würzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed, now 6 October was fixed as date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the Eighth finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third round FC Würzburger Kickers has now finally been terminated.
Played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on, now we have planning certainty," says FCE's team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket advance sale that has been launched.
It is something special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the lap of the last 16 teams the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victories at the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 Euro and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club cup 2016 / 2017.
Defender is a third-party player.
Viennese architect Karl Mang 92 Years old passed away
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna ’ s Hofburg and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese accuses policewoman with money
Ex-Soccerplayer Tim Wiese has not noticed in Bremen.
Soccerplayer once was, meanwhile Tim Wiese, former national gatekeeper in Germany and with Bremen and TSG engaged, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, he has not increased.
Meadow was just cut in Bremen ’ s city centre when he saw a car park keeper exhibiting a fine for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow then rushed out of the shop, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under examination," it says of the city of Bremen.
Only afterwards will it be decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants

For three days the Panamanian authorities have been breaking out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat on 17 years old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden. On Friday evening, around 11.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one from the group, a 17 year old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.
Three people also stayed on the premises of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the young man and struck him with his fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was bleeding strongly from the nose.
When his two friends hurried and appeased the thug, he left his victim at first.
His friends brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator persecuted the group with a car to their home and passed there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far only a vague description of the perpetrator exists.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racquet is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181 / 100 and 123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim and Asendorfs mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl and Heinrich will be standing by his successor in the next few months with half a position.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, before which he invests 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller and Gongoll, who is currently completing their specialist training in the Verden hospital and wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The Müller couple liked the idea of practising their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39 year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen.
The two-time father Frank Müller grew up there, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and was appointed as a senior emergency physician in Diepholz County in 2009. He is also volunteer in the Federal Democratic Republic of the Congo.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internistine) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"Endoscopy comes out," says 38 year-old Silvia Müller of Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and stressful ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of 50000 Euros as part of a subsidy programme from the county (25000 Euros) as well as from the municipality (12500 Euros) and the municipality (12500 Euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," says velvet mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller, about 2000 patients come each quarter into practice Felstehausen, in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another medical practice.
A positive side effect of the practical acceptance by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller ’ s consultation session continue to look into familiar faces: the seven medical employees and the cleaning force take over from the field ’ s exterior.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel remembers smiling at rock breaks.
A little melancholy they already feel after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely still see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meters of land."
"So far I have always pressed myself before gardening, now that could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also driven up on our southern border," said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl of Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also "take it for granted".
The care and safety of the people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals", the Minister said.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, not even over the Austrian border with Slovenia.
A controlled approach is needed.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow refugees arriving to travel to Austria and Germany, and that it might also establish corridors for the refugees.
But this was not the case with Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik / Sid border in eastern Croatia on Tuesday night to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, all the time.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country is counting on around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian border of Serbia, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "Neither can we nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had travelled all night from the Macedonian border through Serbia, some 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the foretold postponement of the Balkans hitherto foretold route Turkey and Greece and Macedonia and Serbia and Hungary on a slightly further westward route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia ’ s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member had "extensive opportunities for border control".
Strong controls are being carried out to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU's partners have consistently provided the country with good evidence of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
On Wednesday morning, Serbian Minister of Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down a local sight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
At present, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
One cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are still not cleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent to the border region.
Stock Exchanges Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of having repeatedly gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is said to have been used to conduct insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of over $100 million has been awarded.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC's communication.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
Around Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lively operation.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozy strolling.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Keep trams.
Pulsating, sparkling life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice assistance is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the chalk and adds the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "drive the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop briefly, read, say sentences like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Time and again small discussions about the action itself, about life, about dealing with death develop on the periphery.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point will I be able to live responsibly", says the director of the Diakonischen Werkes Mannheim, who is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid together with the Caritas Association.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20 year-old.
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
According to the experience of Josefine Lammer, the topic of death and death is still taboo, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening up of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The companion of death and mourning belongs to the volunteers of the first hour.
Confronted with the subject by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by appeal, she immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany patients and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and hospice St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
"I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervisions of the death and funeral attendants.
Every two years training courses are offered for new employees.
The tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx ’ s Mixed Result, Finance ’ s Prospects for 2016 Lowered
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket retail 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which averaged 4.9% and become effective on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be levied from November.
The company said it would nevertheless expect earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online retail.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "yields solid returns if we consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for vacations were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zack ’ s Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decline in the number of international priority shipments, which brought the turnover in its unit express shipping to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transport sales rose by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras Mahogany Table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at an end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed leader Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing well, recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten the already cautious Fed leaders to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait, ” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself makes the financial market unsettled.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted an interest-rate increase this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists alleviate the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points, or 1.4%, jumped to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed will maintain policy this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates at that time, ” he said.
If it does, "it should go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that, despite the liberal complaints that more economic progress would be needed, she expected to increase the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and close to the level that the Fed regards as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrank at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that slowing China ’ s economy would curb global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now close to 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed representatives, market turmoil influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracting reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China, ” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in decision-making.
But ultimately, the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by former head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow ” its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that “the Fed has a history of over-reactions on the financial market that seem to be not linked to economic fundamentals. ”
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee entitled to vote, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite limited recognizable effects on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability aspects first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England ’ s interest-rate committee.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest rates because the markets are stirring up," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Need a great Thai Market?
Try LAXC in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAXC Inc.
LAXC is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai Wholesale Market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car depot if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX and BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has different take-away options.
What is there: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAXC has it probably.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galanga, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pork and natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping cart and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAXC has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small help for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 Lenzen.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker ’ s home on Dillinger Straße.
There it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a real school.
Brazil ’ s Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to inform women in a shocking way about how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should undertake.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
Planning for the long-awaited gym construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände is progressing step by step: in the latest regional council meeting, the elaborated building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Prior to that, the committee had decided, among other things, to apply for an "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Therefore a "saddle roof with not central first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
Background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together", explained mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roofing tendency, which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan prescribed - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "exemption" became necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof inclination does not allow any "exceptions" - whereby the Bernrieder municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively with applications for exemption.
Turnhallenbau, however, is not a recurring project: "We do not thus create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots promotion.
In the next process step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted for inspection.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by Councillor Andrea Jochner.
However, the Supervisory Board made a decision on this matter, and next Wednesday, September 23, the Supervisory Board will meet.
Should the plans be implemented, then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the further existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
The employees, who cannot go to Schongau, will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who is to succeed, the name "Fischer" came into play, according to Jochner, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "appreciation" and a widening of the offer in the range "internal medicine", so Jochner.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer is to lead both houses until the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current refurbishment at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Councillor Jochner Trudeau Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I exclude that." As the real estate continues, Jochner and Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again", says Fischer about the Quasi's move to the Lech, which had been "positively and very comprehensively" received by the employees.
There was no real prospect for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine Neckar Lions are required this evening (8.15 p.m.) at the Bergisches HC.
The Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the BHC had a painful defeat and had something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the withdrawing on a corn field near Pratau (county of Wittenberg), several hunters were deployed, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first it was unclear how exactly the accident could happen.
The criminal police investigated.
Missing 16 year-olds from Rhineland Palatinate Victims of Violence Crimes
A suspect of the crime has led the police to the corpse of the 16 year olds missing since Saturday from Rhineland Pfalz.
In the interrogation, the 20 year-old admitted that he had killed the young people and thrown their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16 year-old from the Rhineland of Palatinate, missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The corpse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20 year old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, who confessed the act and led the investigators to the location of the corpse.
The sixteen-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed on the day before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
When surveys were conducted in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was a suspicion of the 20 year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested admitted in police interrogation that they had killed the sixteen-year-old and put the corpse into the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with manslaughter.
The purpose of the investigation is to clarify the circumstances of the case.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing" alliance.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units are finished in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first stay accommodation.
Many then come to the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers were rented last year.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also represents significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
Currently, around 770.000 residential units have already been missing in the agglomerations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the loud on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a restart.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
In this way, the basic income tax could be waived and the real estate tax for subsidised apartments could be suspended for a limited period of time.
In addition, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Alliance.
The support programme for refugee shelters of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros already more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had been called up.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is practically no way through, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit via Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with its neighbour Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian border with Hungary, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people came across the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws that entered into force on the same day, moreover, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian border with Serbia, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws consider overcoming and damaging the border fence to be a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Prisoners face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit areas" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were at Röszke's most important transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to obtain asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "Transitzone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people have left at the roadside in recent weeks.
Locking bars were dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria has reached only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, it was concluded for them in Wernstein, "says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Prior to that, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We immediately said that we were taking them by car to Passau.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the 'N' conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased about this," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try to get over the border after the short notice that rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
The regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high.
The bridge festival joined the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociable, day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has moved the position of the Hungarian government into the haze of National Socialism, highly officially and publicly.
Not only are the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas suffering from this policy.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "promised country" they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35.000 winterfixed quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
Also the accommodations of the 20,000 refugees, who had come to Austria on Monday, took place without much turmoil, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to fulfill the number, 35.000 accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are to provide the countries, 15.000 the federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the governors.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP's Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in ORF's "Helfen wie wir" action.
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels, which are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency it could not be that district authorities have to adhere to a certain height of the towel holder or size of the skylights.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a limited period of time.
Contrary to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad explains with his experience that he is more successful in accommodating.
I am an older master, to whom the falsehood is not easily said in the face.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they themselves said.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The search for your own neighbourhood has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips and Arena and Design Center for accommodating refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, because the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For emergencies, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
∑: "Borders are not being blocked"
On Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) accrued further action on the refugee issue in a longer telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst ∑ (CSU).
He assured me that the German borders will not be blocked.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industriezeile is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building the listed IT group S & T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the wise minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T's CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-ups of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
Right from the start S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
S & T invested EUR 1.7 million in the site, EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter, which each belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federation (FFG).
The building is leased from Linz AG to S & T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of remaining space in the building have already been rented out, and an additional 40 percent have been asked.
Lia -Peroni - owner opened second shop in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla's handbags.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog.
The 49 year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project without further ado in the pigeon market of the arcade: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla store opposite the shop, in which it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes of different manufacturers, now everything revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are to have from 75 euro.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I thought for a long time if I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that Furla ’ s producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion has received wide interest from her mother in the cradle.
I am most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women look at a beautiful handbag in rapture, the specialist woman cannot answer with last certainty.
Perhaps it is because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This characteristic also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become president of the US.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether it expresses itself xenophobic, concerns journalists rude or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whirls up the election campaign vigorously.
And cuts well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate city of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate millionaire come from.
The New Yorker with his hairstyle is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants of the village is about -tens of corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Sound urban Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, including the Heinz Ketchup family, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for humility, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts there.
While there is respect for the family ’ s performance, he also tends to think that Trump is “a little bit of a big mouth, ” says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname Kallstadt has in the vicinity, "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of donors.
Trump ’ s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold burial lodge in the US.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not accept Trump because he had once been cut off without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to be launched.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant."
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as he is polished, this is not so likeable," says HansJoachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was a née Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The winemaker retired sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so arousing".
Does he believe that Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72 year old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68 year old.
They would find it better if he did not get the choice, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good".
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the USA were like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President is not," she says.
And: “The grapes will ripen even without President Trump. ”
Wendel ’ s film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, and interest is awakening in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village".
Ludwig Wucherpfennig, vice president of the German Alpine Association, received the 1800 inhabitants of the village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of leadership of liberals, but there have been no major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Abbott overthrew Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a week-long series of international television shows in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure remained below that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise ’ s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands with an average 349.000 spectators to 314.000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former production star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and smote slightly The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5: 00 pm to 5: 30 pm) of the new quiz ’ show, moderated by Andrew O ’ Keefe resulted in an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (5: 30 pm to 6: 00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot and Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour saturated 720,000.
Hot Seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot's Seat will eventually prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn ’ t manage to surpass the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?...
Lana Jeavon ’ s teammates Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor, was wrapped in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons ’ Fellows the day before three two become, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humour, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods last rose?", their answers could become a game spoiler, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons and Markoski quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, apart from themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that all over the show," said Jeavons.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
In her view Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly set to him," she said.
And when she was asked whom Wood should choose, if not she, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a wrangling as the Aussie rugby league convertited it at his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20 ’ 3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt return and also in the ongoing game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey, a special team coordinator who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble cursing and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass in his own area in the Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27 year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia ’ s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rollerfield with weapons.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company seized Yukos, and stopped his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW ’ s autumn clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bavaria ’ s schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new pupils: “We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse, ” said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of free voters meets until Friday in the lower Franconian municipality.
Actually, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates free voters ’ meeting.
"Of course the issue of asylum will overlap the cloister," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslav wars of the nineties.
“That ’ s not going on, we have to get to the causes, ” said the Free Voters ’ Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The head of the Federal Foreign Office criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bavaria moves away, others do not."
"We have to become more capable of action."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing trend remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, cult minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot test "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes again nine years to the Abitur.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The topic G9 must be accelerated," said the FW's head.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free travel at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to be able to kill but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last weeks of violent protests in Nepal ’ s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4000 square meters of land.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square meter plot in the immediate vicinity of the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, commerce and housing.
You are waiting for corresponding offers, it says on the part of the city.
The investor is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstrasse / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Projekt Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Many people are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
For months, negotiations, crumbling, debating and drawing had been held behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Emden lie on the table.
Interested parties, the small and medium-sized Emder enterprise "System for Construction", presented their plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had stood on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP ’ s faction, who accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on the offensive from the system of construction to management: “We do not yet have an answer to all questions, ” he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The project, which is worth around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction were the result of violent reactions among the owners of the sea shack who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of Meerbudenbesitzer and member of the board of directors in the representation of interests of the adherents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This becomes a giant block, which overlooks all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads, so that this pays off", says Schulz
However, what happens exactly on the one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must first have a coherent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased about young people with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for Cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide gravure pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on Tuesday, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravure pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google Launches Doubling Home Donations Campaign to Collect $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation ’ s appeal on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people, like my family, are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who do not receive surgical treatments.
"Mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body ’ s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity has proven to be efficient in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been carried out in people who are obese with a body and mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tubing – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained about the same with those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgical surgery, 36% of the disease completely and 28% of the disease dissolved.
In the medically treated group, diabetes, in comparison, was completely dissolved at only one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure controls, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the 'surgical' group, "the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient ’ s blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In medical therapy, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, said senior researcher Dr. Chih and Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in the BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study by heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing obesity surgery than in a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI ’ s group, ” she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have bound their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving more attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
Also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel might be interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT -News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees ’ homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents in the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the Western European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria ’ s efforts to overcome the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how to create genuine peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush ’ s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, and pointed out that the US ’ violent response entailed a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the US report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years old reporting poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going in the emergency room, ” said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a sample of mutation in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand and disinfectant) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially for young children, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn ’ t let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave this hand and disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come to it, then it ’ s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectant at school, was put into an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah resounded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had thrust her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in the State of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom, "reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police considered the foiled plan to be "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged

Griffiths plays talk about disharmony
There are rumours about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers and former Dutch national league leader Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football champions have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title to rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show any highlights of the Celtic matches and why?"
It ’ s because the Rangers aren ’ t there.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers ’ return.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that is what they are interested in.
There ’ s a lot of excitement in the old-fashioned firm-game games, and it ’ s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the result was the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points advantage.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel the same way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he aimed at some January ’ s transfers, Rangers ’ boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
The former head of the department of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason ’ s time to integrate what you ’ ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with notice of withdrawal

Griffiths swears to avoid tynecastle
The incorruptible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment, ” the forward said, adding,“ It ’ s safe to say that I won ’ t return to Tynecastle if it doesn ’ t play for Celtic Glasgow. ”

McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not even won such games."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland ’ s unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than that of the UK of 5.5%, as shown by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the course of the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5%.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly one year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the UK.

Only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the disturbers in custody.
A breathing alcohol test resulted in a 16 year old 0.89%.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2,15 and initially remained in custody.
Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will watch a man put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn ’ t happen, I ’ ll sit in a spectator ’ s gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, there is a more macabre lottery to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will observe it emotionally.
I cannot.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the movement ’ s public relations work will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go into all the details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after moist police prosecution
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday for a breach of the peace incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's league football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben cousin ’ s humorous Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day ’ s treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said that he had always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when he was talking about the positive cobalt spot test at Lidaris, which he could not explain.
He had held back 18 months for espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it was going on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I am doing within my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a scam.
If that is the case, they should certainly take hold of their noses because they failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should this make me think that it will become personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I'm it.
Perhaps they have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer ’ s frustrations have evolved with Lidari ’ s long-term cobalt examination, and Late Scratching led him to say that he could “throw his license over the table. ”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, described the day of the race as "ridiculous", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been that way the whole day yesterday.
But it also had it on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who set up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man Arrested after Driving Escape
The police arrested a man in Cobram on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and a subsequent driver escape.
The cyclist was sent by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray ’ s Valley ’ s highway.
The police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood in Shepparton for police.
He is expected to be charged with driving flight and omission and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne premier champion Craig Bellamy defeats rivals for claims to wrestling
Melbourne premier league coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' Tackling "Agenda" Setting "by two Premier League favourites of the league.
Sydney Rooster ’ s coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm ’ s players “ring fights ” with his team during the high Storm ’ s victory in Sydney ’ s qualifying finals on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco ’ s coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed comment to the Storm premier team after his team scored the final round victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a “prime example ” of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not“ too good ” in the fight.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were concentrated only on their "contact" during the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches of his team was giving him confidence, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by Storm ’ s team.
"That's coming up again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has been the turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is strange how this occurs again and again during this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was, ” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit dirt.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably did not think about us when it came to big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points exciting?
For me it is the game maps.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
This weekend, the Storm ’ s team will be free to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at the AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug claim
A man who may face a lifelong penalty for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and started in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong punishment for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic ’ s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire quantity and that the café might have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic ’ s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under conditions that he surrendered his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police every day and held a curfew of 18: 00 until 06: 00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: driver ’ s cabin tears apart
In a drive-up accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a lorry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had slowed down towards Basel in front of a permanent construction site.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver ’ s cab of the accident caused a complete breakdown.
The driver was brought seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe Nord was completely closed for more than six hours until 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it fell asleep, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them".
Public prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person, who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to entice them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the conditions on 25 January this year and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg did not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no substantial sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was given a deposit in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
smugglers avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up away from the major points of control at the German border of Austria.
Many smugglers increased people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the Federal Police.
More than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Passau and Rottal districts along the Inn River since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and barges.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration.
According to the Federal Police, more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the start of the week.
Up to 8.00 o'clock alone around 700 people arrived in the state capital, a speaker said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German border of Austria, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Runout of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which in the past days has moved from the Bermuda islands across the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can also be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis until Thursday morning.
On Friday the sun can look longer again.
The mass does it: Every two years the car manufacturers at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, the compact cars that currently sell particularly well are particularly popular.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the Federal Office for Motor Vehicles (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
This year, many new compact models will be presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars.
One of the largest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel ’ s CEO Karl Neumann at the show.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel is promising an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euro.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp, which for the first time include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as a five-door.
The second variant will follow the station wagon in spring, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra grid competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door model in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
He enters the trade early next year, then also as a combo.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand ’ s design line.
The basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
According to manufacturers, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno ’ s launch in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën loader put hand on the front end: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple ’ s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants are available at the IAA in the compact class, such as the refreshed Mercedes A and the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhuman
The Federal Constitutional Court was right to a former detainee of the Tegel Detention Centre, who for months was housed in too small a cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the too narrow rooms (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
A former detainee was thus successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin Penitentiary of Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated from the room.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now at large again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His action for liability for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the Land Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in question liability for the compensation were decisive, there was a compensation claim, it was said.
Otherwise, "a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of money damage.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they told a prisoner compensation only in April because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy of human beings.
Furthermore, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inhumane accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then plaintiff was housed in a similar cell for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks for lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even thugs are said to have already come about because of the tense situation.
According to information provided by the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young people, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"
Immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What comes to Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, some 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year. According to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that and we can do that".
The following overview shows what is happening in Germany.
According to different forecasts, apartments are used annually - for the next five years - between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel institute).
This is almost twice as much as was previously built (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing per year are excluded from the fixed rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable apartments.
Therefore, Federal Minister of Building Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year for this.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Building agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann foundation, criticises.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
Whereas previously there was a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the Residenzpflicht, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority - also because of the lack of skilled workers - have accepted the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
So far there is no sufficient offer of general and occupation-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts.
Therefore, according to Thränhardt, the establishment of networks is the main way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only few refugee parents give their children to the kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents it is first of all very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of kindergarten, the administration distributes flyers in different languages.
Should the demand for kindergarten teachers rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries pupils without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for the lessons.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Refugees willing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Enforcement Act if they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, which has been shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
But this financing gap must also be closed, says Steffen Krach, Berlin ’ s State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and the existing state of Churches should develop the right to a new state of religions.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which takes care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control possibilities.
This includes a willingness to take a heartfelt stance against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
In the future, integration will still be a topic for society as a whole.
In this way, the majority society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention obligate Germany to do must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man- power and capacities are concerned, we do this," he said to the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money has to be added to the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls to hand over health cards to all arrivals alike when registering.
Benefits could later be settled with the federal states.
In the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum Enforcement Act.
Otherwise, doctors make the most of the language barriers to create.
Already so far, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants are ill-informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be paid, she demands.
But many refugees would also be able to go to the emergency ambulances with more general medical contact points.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are much more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, German physicians would be clear about their education with the partially other diseases, according to Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize". And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many refugees were even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates from the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a posttraumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart turf and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horror and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, an early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, treatment usually takes several months.
Furthermore, in the social services, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would usually decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream into the manege on the brick wash.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current manual production.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27 year old junior boss.
"Manegen cocktail with cosmopolitan flair", director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies it wants to easily record the Cuban duo.
Lightness and agility - they identify with these words.
Her humorous art on the mast is intended to conquer women ’ s hearts by storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with sensitivity and articularity.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpent people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephane's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not good, we are not good either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroking unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read by the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the beast does not feel well, neither does it want to be in the manege.
So the highest commandment: care well for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a Zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter if five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 17 o'clock the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa ’ s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unhurt, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
Parliament ’ s opening was also clouded by allegations made by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe ’ s speech by telephone.
Last month they had blown him out and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven oppositions had received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mugabe ’ s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett's Packard will dismantle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett's Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing business and hardware services.
The expected job cuts result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chair and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on providing hitherto unmatched, integrated technology for enterprise solutions," said a statement from the company.
It divided a company founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world ’ s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US Tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal ’ s captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates have to stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation was planned, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly uncertain.
The big disgrace with this current problem is that Wilshere finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
That is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in contact with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd has been investigating 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that, in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a susceptible period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start its Champions League Championship season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will start a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move forward by group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is undefeated even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign started last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal drew the lesson from last season with the Champions ’ League ’ s surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of challenging culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study with more than 2,000 high school pupils with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on the style of substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video-game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler ’ s frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and Ross ’ s longing for Rachel – all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often restrain themselves from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone pastoral employee told me: "My listener role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I get along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider ’ s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept their course when Paris Saint Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player, who brought the French champion on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a head ball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aspire to the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn ’ t Laurent Blancs ’ s team ’ s class game that missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown and the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“It ’ s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it ’ s a good start to win 2: 0, cause problems for our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season, ” said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not scored another one or two goals. "
He returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2-2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was referred to as the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he entered Marco Verratti ’ s pass behind Malmo ’ s defense before passing Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the net.
But if someone believed PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play in order to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two low in the field.
But apart from a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp ’ s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead PSG himself sometimes gave up, with a few false passages and bad conclusions, not least of those of PSG, who, in no less than five attempts, patched alone in the first half and was then abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of the player who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was steered past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus scored his sixth goal of the season, having fished a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was picked up a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last championship league match was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hat off in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through equity sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is hit by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan.
The London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China ’ s economic downturn depresses demand and has devastating effects on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore ’ s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange early on Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 percent on the index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 percent per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper, and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40%.
Refugees arrive in Weimar

The White House confirms Xi Jinping ’ s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi ’ s first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and reciprocates President Barack Obama ’ s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
This evening, the US premier president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand the American China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington ’ s concerns about China ’ s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 Hp sports car borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29 year old wanted to fulfill a dream and lent himself a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy wet highway came then the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was done by a 29 year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was over and out.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell on a wet road into the skid and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, nobody was injured.
The damage is estimated at €40,000.
Xavi: Avoided 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the Al Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously close to Spain ’ s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at that time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish Champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League Champion, two times Club Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35 year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the Al Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"He wanted to have me."
As a reminder: Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Netanyahu was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man is working for the German league today.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed and I have played a great EM."
"He told me that I would not change, that he could not imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bavaria ’ s 2008 / 2009 season would have run with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated triumph in the king classes.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO ’ s Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project ’ s chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined the producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show ’ s finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony," said Brown at first.
The only black person, and she is a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People stood up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing and the rights to the film; Damon replied that her direction "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon ’ s comments.
Twitter ’ s user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing “Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity – that ’ s SO WHITE that it hurts ”.
The tweet earned more than 5,000 reweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon ’ s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a nationwide impact and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck ’ s question of whether the group should be considered a hatred group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior 'crowns first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition 'Show', which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition 'Participant' who could complete all the stages of his obstacle 'course.
During the final season two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
Climbing on a 75 foot rope in 30 seconds was the last task.
Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still under shock at winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
So suddenly.. as I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, he gets the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and how life changes, it gets the great graphics.
I do not think he has any resentment about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers stand on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5 to 4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F and that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger Champion Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13 to 9) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It is hard to throw any game in the bullpen, and therefore I want to go into the game in a concentrated way.
The designated tiger of Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez ’ s first threesome Hit since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the firewood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good while (punch training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh innings, the wins had their best chance to come back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful spot, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before being replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie champion Miguel Sano, who won a two-round run on the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final round of the second round, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed an RBI doubles against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5 and 4.
The right-handed player, however, stole Sano from three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a Phil Hughes not yet moving.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been deleted from the injury list before the game, after he had lacked more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they got the lead off the first batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two round out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second one, scored a One and Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a Two and Out single by Center and Fielder Anthony Gose to 3 and 0.
"It was a big blow," said Twin's manager Paul Molitor.
He did not strike very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitchCount, scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes scored three runs of six hits and a four-strike walk.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez left because of an injury of the throwing shoulders.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1 and 1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing in the right hip joint since August 20.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2 to 2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota ’ s RHP Ervin Santana (5 to 4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in Wiesbaden will then be accommodated in emergency accommodation, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was expected to receive 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared in recent days for this case.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They should then be redistributed to other municipalities.
According to the municipal council responsible for the first admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse in the last ten days alone.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I think the decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago one was glad that the chalice of a military participation passed Germany.
"Now the conflict is coming to our doorstep," he said in Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
On Tuesday evening, Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl and Leitner announced in the Austrian television station ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, it is agreed," she explained.
Concerning the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl Trudeau Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not name concrete figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's Home Affairs Ministers want to make a new start on the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany, the Federal Government intends to give more support to the countries in their initial reception and distribution.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection would receive it.
But anyone who has no prospects for staying cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from looking for alternative routes via Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of other migrants have made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's moon Enceladus a global ocean is swinging.
Researchers conclude this from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon lightly swells around the ring planet on its orbit.
This tumultuous movement is only small, but nevertheless too large for a continuously fixed celestial body, it says in a communication of the Cornell -University in Ithaca (US -state of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn in 2006, spinning water vapour and ice particles and thus feeding Saturn's so-called E-Ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at that time.
The expansion of the hidden ocean, however, was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce approximately one month on offensive actor Valdet Rama.
The association announced that an investigation had resulted in an adductor injury in the 27 year old.
Rama had already complained at the beginning of the week about pain.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break".
"This hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of a unified professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
After his concussion, Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week.
Already on Thursday the Austrian player will enter the running training.
Okotie had injured in the match with Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3) in a violent collision at the head.
Contrary to his first fears, he remained without a serious reading.
No Diet - Fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to his slim line are often discouraged from them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B and vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste pure or sweet.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS replaces up to 95000 grants for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being sought.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce by 95,000 grants for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for the Christmas business in the past year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then distinctive cold front
Next night, in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the Föhntäler.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, wind gusts and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Islands in a strong southwest flow.
On the north side of the Alps, the hairdryer breaks through the valleys during the night.
Subsequently, the Föhn blows in the Föhntälern until Thursday morning with gusts from 60 to 100 km / h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km / h.
The hair dryer can penetrate to the adjacent middle country in places, and even storm gusts of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy Föhn provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stow itself on the Alpensüdhang.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, in the next 48 hours, some over 100 litres of rain per square metre has to be expected south of the Alps, after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn gets out of the air, followed by a cold front with strong rain, partly penetrated by a storm, running from west to east across Switzerland.
Together with the cold front the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decrease significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south on the weekend it becomes sunnier and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther seat in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino a so far nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honoured as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome, next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens Martin Kruse, parish priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes could often only live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority.
With the square it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483 – 1546), a young Augustinian monk, spent some months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
He considered the city to be a depraved sabbath of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated with his theses against the indulgence trade the division of the western church.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the painting for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75 year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can be quite gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked on his bible project for about three years, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "book of all books".
Cycles were created that address themes such as the Way of the Cross, Pests, Commandments or Our Father.
In doing so, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this is true for Luther's publishing house with its theological orientation as well as for Kettler's publishing house with its emphasis on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages chosen by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
The 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible ’ s project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant mistress of the Order.
Otmar Alt remembers: "Education has already happened with the cane."
"I have tried to do this, perhaps to get along with the Lord's Father again".
His second concern is to bring art back to more importance in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall" into the pictures, let them influence themselves, discover and feel what strength they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had always been a lover of Otmar Alts Kunst: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old people did not take care to grasp the Bible in its entirety, but chose the themes that are important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." The result was a picture of the Bible.
For Hans Möhler from Luther Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts Bilder speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar district of the Alto Adige Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX railway seams
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth hills modeled for a round course: one year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX runway was finished again.
Failure in politics and administration caused discomfort, especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So hill deported, new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach and Bock could now communicate it to the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
The work at the former indoor swimming pool was to be started without a "further pause".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal on the weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures that policy is helped to deal with the problems that lie ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that I don't care, I don't have anything to do with it."
"That must interest everyone to get this topic under control," said DFB's head Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet Minister of State Özoğuz and Chancellor there."
"There the topic will certainly play a central role", he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
But politics must set the crucial course.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"We have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 through the Egidius and the Braun Foundation," said Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of them also support this programme.
Already this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign, if they will wear on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the imprint "Wir helfen - # Trudeau eswelcome".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can do it," said Rudi Völler, head of sports at the Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident".
"Everyone is going to be involved, no one is allowed to look away."
"We can play football, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably," said Hertha leader Michael Preetz.
Home managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women ’ s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the European Championship Qualification against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their locations is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the association will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DFB and the Federal Government.
"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP is losing an eye in case of accident
The CEO of Europe ’ s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye by a fall in early July.
In the event of an accident on the stairs in his brother ’ s house in the USA, after midnight he fell on a glass of water, which he wore in his left hand, reports the “Wirtschaftswoche ” on Wednesday.
"He almost died, was powerless, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP's co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully operational".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm full for SAP there, full in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually oscillates between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Something like this can happen to everyone."
"It is important to get up again when you have fallen down."
McLaren's replacement pilot Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen twittered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore equally uneligible as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as he did a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
With Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national league leader will also be missing in a duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 pm / Sky).
"Unfortunately we can't fall back on him," Thomas stated on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga's top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB Coach left open: "We expect him to return to the practice on Friday."
In view of the heavy burden on his pros, he will not only change his staff at Reus ’ s position.
So he announced a change on the doorkeeper position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level", the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in the future in all European league matches, however, left him open.
With high probability he will also contest the second game.
The research statement of fellow players Reus that the final draw for BVB in the European League must be the goal, believes Julian Weigl to be comprehensible: "Marco is not so wrong with this."
"I think we have a good chance to grab the title."
Robot cars: government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing cars.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Netanyahu (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt on the margins of the Automesse IAA spoke of a "new mobility era".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, said the Commissioner.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises among other things the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to "avoid additional liability risks being imposed on the driver", the Federal Government intends to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are only to be expected after 2020.
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the passenger car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD's transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the security of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
Still the Germans see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey carried out on Wednesday by the Forsa institute at the AA on behalf of the Dekra audit organisation concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents reckon with autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the US.
Anyway, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
According to a survey by Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could at least be 15 per cent in the flow of traffic, in congestion 45 per cent.
Well, every fourth would not allow the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
The Duesseldorf wants to play only in singles at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken no later than 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to China for a long-term sponsorship date.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the European Championships 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at that time and we became European Champion."
"We should be guided by this," said the Fifth Party.
Manchester United's English football player Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury on his right leg.
The defender was hit by a tackling of Héctor Moreno in the Champions League match at the PSV Eindhoven and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis of Bastian's 20-year-old fellow player pointed to a shin fracture.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure. The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
Highlights: window mannequins that look frightening human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas stage outfits - and thus that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen from September 18 at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo District Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually he was against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellently choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk, for which a lot of effort has been done: In order to freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist has been engaged.
According to the curator Thierry and Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were carted to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special delicacy: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier ’ s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer ’ s first, timid, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them of course.
For his first own fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener Spitze als Mode
In the past, the long embroidery machines were used in and around Plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early times of the Plauen peak fashion played a greater role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called Vintage Fashion, which is based on past styles, is a growing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of the turnover has broken down.
Private specialized shops and also the wholesale there are almost no more.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are almost exclusively distributed through chains.
Moreover, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
Sufficient reasons therefore for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been holding a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Degree designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
This takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach and Krauße were inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memento.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney Plans New "Mary Poppins" Film
Legends should not be touched, but Disney nevertheless dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, this is not about re-filming, but about a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges the economy to open more broadly to the world
The economy must open more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group tasked with managing the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Lead Group to deepen comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Leadership Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and opening up the market, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thereby give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working document from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants", said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons", are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the limit values still in force about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In exchange for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch called this "trick" because smaller cemeteries, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction manoeuvre that alone helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to human beings and which is strongly enriched in predatory fish via the food chain.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health hazard of the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment mainly through coal burning.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
