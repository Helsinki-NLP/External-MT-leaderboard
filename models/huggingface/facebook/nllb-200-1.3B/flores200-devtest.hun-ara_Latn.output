below are the medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special activity that all cats follow, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females tend to bond more closely with each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.

As a balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) is a member of the lion, leopard, and jaguar groups, and is the only member of the four big cats that can howle.
The tiger's roar is not the full-blown roar of a lion, but rather a phrase made up of words uttered in a whirlwind.
Ocelots are very fond of eating small animals, and if they can, they can also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the smell of animals (prey) and sniff them out on the ground.
They're very good at seeing in the dark, because they have night vision and they're very sneaky, and the parrot cat hunts its prey by blending in with the environment and then hitting its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain or a river, or if it crosses a new island and cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptations.
n ae n ae time, as a new population starts to adapt to a new environment, it's gonna be less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't even be called the same species.
This process is called species formation, which means that new species are formed, and species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.

Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except for another mosasaurus.
The long jaws produce more than 70 bearded teeth, and there is a row of them on the floor of the mouth, so nothing escapes in its path.

Civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.

Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.

35 mm, for example, was the most common still image format in the world, and it was the defining film size at the end of the analog film era.
still in production today, but what's important is that it's now being scaled up to the digital camera image sensor format.
35 mm is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (to obtain the simplest integer ratio after division by 12) can now be set to 3:2.

The rule of thirds, which is often misused and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is the carving of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).

To understand the temples, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The Age of Events is generally referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand technology has an 'impact' on societies, and these impacts are concomitant rather than socially conditioned".

The countrywide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to high rates of road accidents, which stimulates the development of new techniques in health care to heal injured bodies.

In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures associated with a given geographic location evolved, which, in keeping with the location of the community, proved to be superior to arbitrary laws.

Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The position of the Byzantine Empire deteriorated in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders rejected such dubious gifts as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
Then Paris took the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic style was at its peak from the 10th-11th century to the 14th century.

subsistence farming is farming that is only done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds and a seed drill or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Throughout history, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for the development of self-esteem within them.
Subcultures may be characteristic of members based on age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender.
Subculture can be defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable symbolic style, which includes fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
one of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the examples of some unfortunate children who, because of neglect, misfortune or premeditated abuse, were not able to socialize with adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been isolated by humans (often their own parents) and sometimes the abandonment of the child was due to the child's severe intellectual or physical weakness.
The children who went wild may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised with animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a child in the wild with physical limitations will almost entirely adopt the behavior patterns of the animal caring for him, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help which provides support to those who are participating in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The stands can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of 'stand', but also the little guy with the gimp in Microsoft Office".
The virtual stands are built into the software to question, guide, question and explain the procedures that would have challenged the student to complete the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
You should never let a child grow up without a nurturing, nurturing, nurturing environment, and yet it does happen.
We consider foster care to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care is about a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable health care system.
The orphanage must provide for all the needs that are missing from the former home from which they were removed.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of usage and satisfaction model.
Learning andsocialization are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
personal involvement andcontinuous relationships were also considered as new motivational factors in the study by Eighmey and McCord (1998), which focused on the audience's reaction to internet pages.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting for a few milliseconds.
e it is claimed that some people can correctly tell if someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay on the presidential speech, pointed out that people with brain damage who cannot understand speech, are very accurate in their perception of honesty.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation opens the door to new genetic variation, selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.

Out on the savannah, mammals with digestive systems similar to humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
What's more, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they're cooked.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a list of food additives that are safe to use in food.
though, all things considered, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way as today's chimpanzees do on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening from a normal sleep cycle and falling back to sleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can do this pretty easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you into a state of alertness without waking you up completely.
If you're sleeping, set the clock to the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to consume a lot of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is in contrast to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.

Tibet is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded upon by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.

Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of the war, differences in systems, methods and cultures resulted in the countries entering into conflict.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
over the next 40 years, proxy armies fought in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of freighters is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods, while preventing the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
one of the most memorable and recent examples of this was the north atlantic campaign of world war ii where the americans tried to cross the atlantic ocean with men and supplies to help the british.
t, the German Navy tried, primarily with submarines, to stop this traffic.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their easily available milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that migrated up hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent shepherds, similar to the more widely known shepherds.

Though the tracks were only parallel, they allowed the horses to pull faster and heavier than on the relatively shorter, winding roads of the era.
They used the connecting elements quickly enough to keep the track in place, but they also realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron made better use of the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first fully iron railways were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking.
their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
The two-legged fossils are found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

Pratically all computers today are based on handling information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Poisoning internally is not necessarily immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most certain sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicinal or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if it contains the first aid instructions for the poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitize humans.
The robber snails and bed snails are also nesting, meaning they are suitable for nesting or use by the host organization.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby
At adoption, the blood-breeding parents give up their parental rights to another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works with scientific methods. This method is basically the basis for most scientific research.
Experimentation and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, which also help in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotelis's views have been adopted by all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language, the West cut itself off from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The majority of the rhythms that can be achieved in the field of physiology and human behavior are, in most cases, highly dependent on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, we observe periodic rhythms, which are not mere reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps running freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important proofs for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked the DNA of the beech with radioactive phosphorus or the beech protein with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the sights, including flora and fauna.
The on-the-spot programmes include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.

Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has a complaint about these.

Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Thanks to the fact that drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range, traffic processes are generally reasonably consistent and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flows, a relationship was found between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along their body.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, only the squirrels and the beggars can't fold their hind wings.

The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, with a water volume more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at 6 miles wide in places.
20% of the river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the main river, 3,980 miles long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Though the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and structure of the pyramids of Giza.

Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.

Vatican City is a city of Roman Catholics.

Aristóteles, the philosopher, thought that all the elements were made up of one or more elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four layers of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he thought these would become new materials that we could see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.

Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of all matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small, they could fit trillions of them in the end of a sentence.
So when the pencil came out, it did a lot of good for people.

The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to collide a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wagon driving up a mountain, the fission of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they sometimes split apart for little effect or even by themselves.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the marshes and thicker under the plateaus.
Possible black rocks nearby because the crust is thinner and the lava is easier to rise to the surface.
Content Theory focuses on what drives people, or what stirs their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
Theories are about what makes people want to do what they do and what makes them do what they do in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"There are basically two behaviors that can develop when leaders start to lead their former colleagues.One end of the spectrum is when they try to stay with the guys".
It is difficult for such a leader to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary procedures, perform performance evaluations, define responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
on the other side of the spectrum, someone becomes a little bit of an unrecognizable person who feels that everything that the group has created has to be changed and made their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are measured on the same scale as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for the direct physical group.
They have more independence than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management is not sure they understand.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of the virtual team.

why would an organisation go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organisation? one of the goals of implementing learning concepts within organisations is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in functional areas of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can surface.
The result is that the process of working together to overcome barriers creates a new innovative process within the organisation to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organisations achieve greater performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so this narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It's long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and even alter certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to observe structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material that we can use to build simulation models to understand what processes are going on in our minds.
e AI has a strong science-fiction connotation, it's actually a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
such as control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
like these things have become independent disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in the software of many home computers and video games.
Classroom tours are a big part of every classroom. Teachers often and willingly take their students to places where bus tours are not possible.
Technology makes virtual excursions possible, where students can view museum art, visit an aquarium, or admire any artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of a class trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with the class of the future.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their visit to the state capital, they revise the website every year, but as a memoir, they keep the old versions available online.

Maintaining the audience's interest encourages students to be thoughtful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; active reactions to online material can help students to define their position on other people's writing and their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, and it has many art collections and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is to the south, and Muskoka, an undisturbed natural beauty, is to the north.
They, along with many other things, represent Ontario in an unadulterated Canadian light to foreigners.
To the north, they are found in vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes in almost completely uninhabited wilderness.

The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most continental island in the world in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are associated with an independent nation, or France, and are famous for their luxury beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and they conquered a considerable area in the Comoros and Mayotte.
Europeans began to influence and colonize the area in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
