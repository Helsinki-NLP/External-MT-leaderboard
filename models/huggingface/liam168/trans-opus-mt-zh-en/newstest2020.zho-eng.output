The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 September states that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
According to the comprehensive external media report, the IAEA report states that the advanced centrifuges at the Iranian Nattanz Nuclear Facility are “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the nuclear agreement last May and the imposition of sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the major Powers.
The agreement provided that Iran could only refine uranium with the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories to the agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Common News Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japan's Foreign Minister, Moo-gi, held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that the conclusion of peace treaty negotiations covering the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Russia and Russia, known as “the four northern islands”, and Russia as “the South Korean islands”) would be advanced and that relations between the two countries would develop in a wide range of political, economic and other areas, and that there was agreement between the two sides to coordinate his early visit to Russia.
This was the first consultation with the Russian Federation as the head of the negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty, after Shigeki took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Maori expressed to the Russian side that “including the promotion of common economic activities (on the four northern islands), there is a desire for effective consultation”.
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the Russian summit meeting in December 2018, it was confirmed that the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, should expedite the negotiations.
At the meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and waste disposal.
Shigeki expressed the expectation that the tourism pilot operation, scheduled for October, would “hope to be successfully implemented, leading to the next step”.
In addition, the meeting confirmed the November visit of Lavrov to coincide with the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Group of Twenty (G20) in Nagoya.

The women's platoon is expected to champion the World Cup ahead of time!
On 27 September, in a competition against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was brought back to the city by the opponent after winning two games, culminating in a victory of three to one in the Netherlands.
The World Cup is nearing its end, but the Chinese women's platoon must not be taken lightly in the face of the Serbian team.
In the first two rounds of the competition with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women ' s platoon was as strong as in the past, with 25:19, 25:16 before the fall of the two cities, until the third, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women ' s platoon has increased the aggressiveness of the serve while falling behind, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls ' aggressive intentions and failures have begun to increase, with the result that the rivals returned to a city at 21:25.
In an interview, Qijiro Ping also pointed out: “The third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake.”
Of course, the Dutch women's platoons were no less powerful, and the Chinese women's platoons were hard prepared before the race, and despite losing a game, everything was still under the control of Lumping, who said, “It's normal to win the game with the strong, it's normal to win, it's normal to play five, so we said to the players,” he said.
In the fourth round, the players actively adjusted their positions, Zhang Changning opened fire on the attack, received eight points in the single round, and did a great job in winning the team.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation have left only two rounds, and while one hand has touched the championship, the Chinese women's platoon has indeed been alerted in the competition against the Dutch team: the more critical it is, the more dedicated it will be.
In another game, on 27, the Russian and American women's platoons filled five games, and the United States team failed to score all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's platoon could be crowned in an early round, with all three points in the competition against Serbia.
All things are moving towards a situation favourable to the Chinese women ' s platoon.
However, while the Serbian team's six major forces were in short supply, that did not mean that they would give three cents to the Chinese team easily.
In the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team has largely lost its medal, which means that they can “be light” in the competition against the Chinese women's platoon, drop their loads and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the state is likely to rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement Serbian team was not a “sculpted” lamb, as evidenced by the depth of its thickness, as evidenced by the fact that in the five-round battle with the Dutch, the Serbian 2nd team eventually reversed the Dutch all-power stance at 3:2.
Before the third phase of the game, Ruan Ping also said that the Ho and the Se's teams would be tough: “The Osaka game will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully, as always.”
Now that the horn of the crown has been blown, the game has really entered the “white heat stage”.
In terms of power, the Chinese women's platoons are above the rivals, but only at the last minute, and it is up to the girls to be able to play their normal level and unleash themselves in the race.
On this (27) day, the University of Macao organized the “Second Seminar of the Macao stem cells”, which attracted more than 100 experts from countries and regions such as the United States, Singapore, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in the field of “offer stem cell” research, sharing and exploring the latest technologies and developments in stem cell research with teachers and students of the Macao University.

On September 24, “a boat ticket took me to see a charity-helping event on the head of Changsha, where more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Star Cruise to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 persons with disabilities who attended the event were boarded for the first time on a cruise ship.
Zhao Zheng, 56 years old, is a crippled person and usually rarely leaves the home because of his mobility problems.
He said, “For the first time today, on a cruise ship, he was admiring the vastness of the Gang, feeling the developmental pulse of the Sha, feeling very excited and unforgettable.”
Volunteers from the Fukuon Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided nuanced services to persons with disabilities.
Especially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carry them up and down the liner.
According to the head of the FWCSC, over the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the Government, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to progress, with an increasing number of persons with disabilities becoming real participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are glittering and glowing, and it's them who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk glitters...
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Yongping, a deep-seated rice researcher, brought forth good seeds and ploughed the earth, leaving one billion people at risk of starvation, and for no good reason, is also an old farmer who likes to be in the fields; Nan In-dong, the chief scientist who craves China's eyes, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a pot, who spends his life doing one thing, eating cold brooms in the deep mountains of Guizhou, and the old man in the castle, who is not the same as the old man, a red man, a village boy who is so late, who is still like a red son, who learns in the middle and west, with a grotesque white hair, who speaks of his heart, who likes to laugh; Qin-yun, a half-day movie artist, who, after nine or ten years of age, is also happy to be an unknown old maid in the Highlands...
They, who seek to be pure, simple and committed, so long as they are immersed in the unease of the outsiders and their cherished cause, are easy to rejoice, not in the name, but in the wealth and prosperity of the people.
Like Kim's novel, Shaolin's temple hides the razed monk in the attic, despite the horrors of martial arts, showing no flair, no joy and no sorrow.
Every Monk, every heart, every heart, has a share of the country that belongs to me.
Our country assumes responsibility not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school, in the words of an Internet friend, "When a hero passes, someone has to sit on the side of the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a man sitting on the side of the road."
Actually, there's no contradiction between being a hero and being a hero.
People on the side of the road who applaud are also passing heat and light, and they are also luminous.
As you are me, there are opportunities, moments, days and months, and the shape of heroes.
Shanghai's excellent judge, Zou Beihua, who took the burden of judicial reform on his shoulders, brought the messenger teacher to tell his story at the annual conference, sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, “get the simple thing done, it's not simple,” and Zou Beihua led the judges to give a round of applause to this old ‘scrubbing monk’.
It's between heroes. It's a hero who applauds another hero.
The pavilion of the temple of Shaolin, the vast rice experimental fields of Yuan Long Ping, the Intung Nan, the Sky's Eye, the stage of Qin Yi, the platform of Zhou Chang you can be a hero, not on your own, but a better environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
China SkyEye, for example, is now a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slope, and the novelist Liu Tse Xin has yet to write " Three Bodies " .
The greatest “eye” at that time, the single-gauge radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island – Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter – was considered to be the largest in a world “unbeyond.”
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan In-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio “big telescopes” in China, receiving more messages from outer space.
China's a waste of time. So you're spending a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan In-dong, and the "Eye of Heaven" project began with a great deal of work.
It took 12 years to select the site, and nine years to set it up.
The 500-metre “Eye of Heaven” opened, and China became an unprecedented “unique scientific engineering in the world”.
So, the Eye of Heaven is remarkable, the In-dongs of the South are remarkable, and the Republic, which has great tolerance and greatness.
With the trust of the State, the goodwill of its citizens, the Indongs of the South have the opportunity to become the living soul of the nation.
A country with young talent, a white-haired hero walking by, a country where people applaud lightly on the side of the road, is beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification is the first to go to Gilling's kindergarten, and the idea of environmental protection begins with the doll.
On 27 September, a kindergarten in Gilling City, Jilin Province, introduced a garbage classification education course to teach young children how to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
This is known to be the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood education classes.
A programme of work for the promotion of the classification and disposal of waste in urban life at the land level in Jilin province was launched jointly by nine departments in Jilin province.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot compulsory classification of domestic waste in the city of Changchun, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the role of a young child as a family, a kindergarten as a social enabler, and the promotion of the concept of environmental protection.
The executive director of the Pan Children's International Kindergarten, Liu Lijun, said that the event had been organized.
On the same day, the Director read out an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would be classified from the child.
After performing the low-carbon bell dance, the children grouped themselves into a little garbage sorting game.
The tutor also issued the " Recoverable " " " Other Garbage " label, which the children are advised to stick to the trash can and make small videos when they return home.
Liu Lilong reported that the kindergarten has been promoting the idea of low-carbon, green environment, and that it has regularly opened environmental pedagogics.
Classifiable waste cans have also been installed at the dump site in the park, where the type of dump is indicated.
Teacher taught the kids what recyclable garbage is, geese.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018, Jilin Province produced approximately 54652 tons of municipal waste, all of which entered the waste disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 32.92 million tons were filled in sanitary landfills, 2,092 million tons were burned, and 80.1 million tons were treated through integrated processes.
After many years of efforts, all municipalities and counties of the province have the capacity to treat household waste in a manner that is not harmful.
In the Work Programme for the Promotion of the Classification and Disposal of Land-based Municipal Waste in the Jilin Province, which has been published, it is explicitly requested that activities be further developed for the classification of waste into schools, educational materials, classrooms, etc., and that interaction between students and parents be strengthened through the creation of songs, songs, cartoons, microvideos, etc., with the effect of “evaluating a child, influencing a family, bringing a community, nurturing a new generation”.
According to data released on 27 September in Madda, global sales in August amounted to 117,015 vehicles.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent, as a result of the impact of underinvestment of new vehicles and reduced prices, among other things.
Japan’s domestic sales fell by 6%, and the demand for the last bus before the consumption tax hike in October was limited.
In August, Majuta’s sales in China amounted to 17729.
August 2018 was also 13 per cent lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China's dedicated main SUV “CX-4” sales decreased by 14%.
“CX-4” has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of new vehicles has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to raise brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Madheda’s sales in the United States grew by 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching 27482 vehicles, which grew 14 months later.
In August, the vendor’s business days were one more day than in the previous year, combined with “enhancement of promotional activities such as publicity” (Majeda), which led to an increase in sales of the SUV “CX-5” etc.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6 per cent, to 14422.
According to the company, the emergency purchase before the tax increase was “not as high as in the last time (2014)”.
The sale of mini-cars such as "Demio".
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac passed away and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the many political legacies left by the French politician when he came to power in that year are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal and charismatic manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and independence, as well as his firm support for European integration, as a representative of the pursuit of the “European Dream”.
At the same time, he was a strategic statesman, a strong advocate of the multipolarization and multilateralism of the world.
That is why the French media assessed him as “France's distinguished representative on the world stage”.
One of the promising political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the United States-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, stood up to the pressure of the United States and was at the forefront of the war against it.
A year after the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later on, it proved that Chirac ' s warning was quite correct.
In a time of European integration and the growing prominence of the unilateralism of the United States, there is no doubt that Chirac's strategic thinking and choices about international politics and global affairs are highly instructive.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and cordial to the Chinese.
He was one of the protagonists and creators of the “Golden Decade” of Chinese-French relations, which, after his first election as President of France in 1995, was driven rapidly by the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China entered a completely new phase of bilateral contacts.
During Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas, including aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made ground-breaking progress.
The Meso-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative created a completely new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac was particularly impressed with Chinese culture throughout his life.
It is known to his Chinese diplomats that Chirac was able to recite some of Li Bai's and Dupu's poems and even to judge accurately the historical years of China's bronze apparatus.
“It is not true that the pyramid came to Egypt, it is not true that the Qin came to China” – a phrase that comes from Chirac.
“The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.
But I myself have full confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization whose experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities for a long time on the world stage.”
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will last.

Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored an anti-American Hong Kong bill.
In a joint statement issued on 27 July by some formed members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, a strong opposition was expressed to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Council of both Houses of Congress of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of the status of free trade ports and separate customs areas, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in the various fields of the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc., in the name of “Hong Kong, China”, in the form of trade, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always been in strict compliance with international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaged in business with different countries and regions, and engaged in cooperation in a wide range of related fields.
The statement stated that the adoption of the bill by the United States Senate and the Foreign Council was not necessary, but merely as a means of responding to the call of its agents in Hong Kong to intervene violently in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and to seek political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
Formed parliamentarians expressed their deep regret and strong opposition to this move by the United States.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.
The good rule of law, a fair and free business environment, a clean society in Hong Kong make it a good place for American businessmen to conduct business.
The adoption of the bill by the United States would, in addition to attacking the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, further aggravate the relationship between China and the United States, to the detriment of others.
The statement states that Hong Kong will, as always, remain steadfast in its implementation of the principle of “one country, two systems” and will continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and to fulfil its obligations effectively.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce, whether in the past, the present or the future.
According to the 26th of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss migration policy reform next week.
French President Markron recently claimed that France cannot “take everyone” but at the same time try to “better accept” it.
It was reported that Markron had attempted to find a compromise route in immigration matters and to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview in New York, United States, during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a genuine “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said, “If France wants to be properly admitted (immigrants), it will not be able to accept all”.
Markron identified four priorities of migration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who entered France illegally and were not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “National Medical Assistance” (AME) system was the most discussed topic in the past.
Markron indicated that he wished to be able to “assess” the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it to certain limits.
Following these statements by Markron, the extreme right-wing leader of the National Union, Le Pomp, wrote that Markron's pronouncement was “false talk”.
The President of the Senate, Rasher, a member of the right-wing Republican party, also expressed the view that immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderated” but “counter-real” manner, indirectly criticizing Markron.
The leftist Socialist Congressman Valau argued that, in the case of immigration, France should “take more and better” and criticize Markron for “wiping” the subject.
Reports indicate that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in force for one year, has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time has not been able to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next general election, in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of an extreme right-wing attack, and Markron will need to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time he will run the risk of inflaming left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It was reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly would start a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China’s A shares are “backloading” and that many listed companies are buying back their shares with “real gold and silver”.
According to statistics on Eastern wealth of financial data service providers, as at 27, the total amount of repurchase implementation by A-listed companies in 2019 was more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, lower than in the same period in previous years, creating a record high in A-stock repurchase capital.
In response, Xuyang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that the overall valuation of the A share market this year was low, the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices was conducive to more efficient use of funds by listed companies, as well as to the willingness of listed companies to manage market value and cash flows, and to boost investor confidence.
In addition, the system of repurchase of shares, which is constantly improving, has also stimulated active repurchase of shares by listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued regulations for the implementation of repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed regulations and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies with increased buy-back schemes have been concentrated in the capital, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment industries.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased in excess of $1 billion this year.
The first of these is the IRI shares, which buy back more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of stock buybacks by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese news agency journalist, the Vice-President of the Financial and Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, Zhao Si Jun, stated that repurchases demonstrated, on the one hand, the stronger economic power and better financial position of listed companies, their ability to maintain stable stock prices and their confidence in investors, and, on the other hand, the accountability of listed companies and their controlling shareholders to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, while the latter requires a high quality of the listed company and its controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, these are the most central building blocks.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies helped to boost investor confidence and supported the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Research also estimates that, based on the expected stock buybacks from A stock listings as a whole since the beginning of the year, and on the average value of the stock that has been repurchased, this year ' s stock buy-back is expected to bring in an increase of $150 billion to the A stock market.
In almost two months, the restoration of the Qur'an Monument, a large-scale mural of the post-Tianjin palace, by the national focal point, was concluded on 26 months, and will be reopened during this year's national holiday.
The Qur'an is a large, traditional mural that comprehensively reflects the life of Mother's mother.
With the approval of the relevant State authorities, it was created from 1991 to 1994 by the Director of the former Tianjin Civic Museum (the Queen's Palace).
It is known that the mural was painted on the south and north walls of the Queen's Palace, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres tall, in two parts, with more than 30 stories of the birth of the Queen, the sea crossing, the plume rising, etc., and 358 people rediscovering the life of their mother.
Tianjin's heavy summer rains and dry winters in recent years led to a burst of murals, which accounted for 60 per cent of the total mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the mother ' s ancestors, the Congregation of the Ancient Cultural Streets and the Queen ' s Palace in the south of the city of Tianjin began work on the restoration of the mural of the Queen ' s Palace and its interior.
The restoration work was led by Chai Chang-kyu, with the participation of four prominent national painters.
The restoration was based on the principle of `renovation as old as old', while also adapting the local content of the original mural to supplement the original imperfection.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in colour, materials, pen ink, etc.
The original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and art style was maintained after restoration.
The Queen's Palace was established in 1326 and is known as the Queen's Palace. It has undergone numerous renovations. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China.
On 25 September, the launch ceremony of the Beijing Daesing International Airport took place with great vigour.
The stylish plaque of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport terminal, called "The Phoenix's wings" is the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is overstretched, carrying 100 million + passengers last year, becoming the second year of the world, after Atlanta Airport in the United States, where passengers have swallowed hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, Beijing Daes International Airport is expected to have 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, the number of passengers will have reached 72 million and the proportion of international flights is expected to reach 30 per cent.
How cool is it when it's a "new country door"?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport, located between Beijing City and Guangyang City, Hebei Province, is 46 km from Tiananmen, the largest new airport to be built around the world.
The surface projection of the steel structure of the roof of its terminal amounted to 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport is the world’s first air terminal with two levels of arrival and two levels of departure – international, domestic, domestic, and international.
The two-storey bridge, which connects the high-speed and the airport from outside the terminal, corresponds to the F3 and F4 terminals, respectively – international departures to the floors and domestic departures to the two floors.
The first flight of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's “double airport”.
The new airport has been established as a large international aviation hub, a new power source for the development of the country, and an integrated regional traffic hub in Kyoto, which supports the construction of the new area of Yu An. To date, a total of 66 airlines, including 20 domestic, 46 regional and foreign airlines, are interested in entering the Beijing Daesing International Airport, and airline flights are being approved on an ongoing basis.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are internal and 15 are international, covering 112 points worldwide, including 97 national and 15 international.
This has resulted in a well-developed, well-competitive and internationally competitive “two-hub” airport configuration with the capital's international airport, which has eased the operational pressure on the capital's saturated airport capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and the surrounding areas, and has effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, the Beijing Daesing International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runways have adopted a “all-way” layout, the world's largest automated air traffic management system, and the China's largest terminal control zone has been established, maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, airports of this size in the country have used nationalized baggage processing and information management systems, using innovative baggage transfer models to improve the efficiency of luggage processing.
The first voyage of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport heralded the phoenix's foiling and cool flying.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, domestic and national first, with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and to inject an imperil into the economic development of Beijing.
Marv is scheduled to convene a congress in November, to be transferred to the Party until the age of 16.
A central congress was tentatively scheduled to be held in early November, with the intention of amending the party charter to be transferred to the party until the age of 16.
With the adoption by Congress of a downward revision of the voting age for general elections, Mawar announced the 66th Central Congress, to be held this year, with proposals to amend the party charter, which included a downward adjustment of the membership age of Mawar, from the current age of 18 to 16.
The President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dato ' Seri Wei, said that the Central Committee had been scheduled to hold a central congress on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the date of the congress might change as a result of the by-election of the Danish-Ai seat.
He said that, as the Electoral Commission would meet only on 1 October to finalize the nomination for the by-election date and the date of the voting for the Danish National Seat, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee convened yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's statutes, but only happened to coincide with the tragic death of Congressman Danjumpi of the Indigenous Unity Party, Dato' Mohamud, and therefore joined the agenda of the State's by-elections.
Xinhua Network
Wang Guoxiang, who was born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served successively as secretary of the Commune Party, county committee secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang was the Secretary of the Cantonal Committee for Life in Shandong Province, which was a poor district in the province.
During the five years of his tenure, Mr. Wang focused his efforts on three things in the heart of the people: the promotion of the industrialization of vegetables; the development of a salty salt beach in the north; and the laying of the foundations for an industrial turn, which led to the emergence of a pocket and a backboard.
Life farmers have a tradition of vegetables and lessons of growing them.
At the beginning of the 1980s, subsistence farmers were unable to sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
The Wang Bo-xiang study found that the key to catching vegetables is to get the circulation done.
Lifelight was the first to establish a wholesale market for vegetables and to set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres have to take the lead, screw up, and all the lost county has to take the lead.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-xiang, 17 members of the three-dollar village, Lo-yee, built 17 winter-hot vegetable sheds, and 17 “two million households” emerged from the village in that year.
This was followed by the establishment of a promotion group in the county, which, with the mobilization of Wang Bo-xiang, directed Wang Lo-yi to the countryside; over 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds moved to the county and to the country as a whole.
For hundreds of years, 1.6 million acres of land have been painted on shallow beaches, with the exception of saline beaches.
The local population is living in very difficult conditions.
Soo Nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Subei?
A hundred thousand of Wang's organizations fought in a general war, camped on the barbarous beaches for forty and a half days.
Wang's leaders and leaders of the county ate and lived on the construction site, pushing the loads like private workers, hanging around, and the people saw them stretching their thumbs, admiring their eyes ... At that time, Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a “pore pot” on salty beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-xiang participated for the first time as the county secretary in the industrial conference of the city.
During the meeting, a “Big Table of Industrial Economic Figures in the 12th Prefectural District” was released, which ranked fourth in the fourth place in terms of gross industrial output and life expectancy at first glance.
However, if the original salt is removed, the life-saving pure industrial output will be only 119 million yuan, third in the penultimate.
Wang Xiang, with more than 70 men, went to the field to “change his mind”.
Less than a year later, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, the mission has been organized to carry out the journey to Shenzhen, Dongjung and Shanghai.
Life is short of businesses, and there is still a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-xiang presided over the thematic meeting: the public selection of the director of the factory across the county led to the emergence of 40 “careful and talented people” who were pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, he joined the ranks of the 100 counties of the country, and Wang Bo-xiang was transferred to the post of Deputy Mayor of the city.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, more than 100,000 “million-dollar households,” a cadre recognized by the people. The people of the past still call him, “Our Book Secretary.”
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d'Ivoire, which is currently a member of the Security Council, Tano, Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, South Africa, Pandor, and Niger, which is a member of the Security Council, Kara, and Tunisia, who are currently members of the Council.
Wang Ying made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, the strength of solidarity.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation was unilateralism, the direct consequence of which was the challenge to the basic norms of international relations and the impact on the role of the United Nations, to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing countries, including those in Africa, and of small and medium-sized States.
Meeting this challenge requires the strength of solidarity, with the help of the hands and the shoulders of the Central African Republic.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa will not be just four votes, but will lead others to follow, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Council, which needs to be fully utilized.
Secondly, we rely on consultations to resolve the dispute.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex and difficult issues on the Council's agenda, particularly hotspots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and, in some cases, are directly related to external factors.
Together, we want to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Thirdly, self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know best Africa's problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.
In dealing with the hotspots of Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and to resolutely promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we want to insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to build a “one-way” with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 and the development strategies of African countries, and to help African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and to address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to promote greater United Nations investment in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has done and will continue to do its utmost to provide the necessary human and material assistance, and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations, WHO and others and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Relays such as the Neonatal Unit save small lives.
Surprise!
The pregnant mother had an early seizure and, on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby could not wait to be born on her father ' s sidecar.
Fortunately, obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved the small life.
Conversely, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the obstetric and neonatal departments of the maternal and child health centre in Hubei province received three premature births on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were for 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng, a second-born mother, at 7 a.m. on 19 September, felt a little ache in her stomach, thinking that she had 32 weeks of pregnancy, and that the first birth was premature, and that she had packed the waiting items and was ready to take a bath and go directly to the hospital.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong ' s home to the hospital.
The baby could not wait to be born on his father's sidecar shortly after the car had left the house.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Maternal and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
The hospital security officers saw the upset couple and the baby, immediately informing the maternity ward, and the four doctors and midwives, Liu Yanyan, who were waiting for the deputy doctor, and were carrying the delivery bag and the umbilical cord drive, stormed downstairs.
“At that time, the mother was half lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, with a baby boy next to her, with a umbilical cord.”
Zhang Qing asked about the 32-week premature birth of the baby, the lack of time for parents to cover the children, the coldness of the early autumn morning, the coldness of his skin, the absence of tears and the weakness of his limbs.
Yoo Ying went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cord, and Zhang Qing broke into the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, covered the child with a couple of layers of balconies and groceries, and cleaned the respirator (e.g. map) for the newborn, and then carried the baby to the 12th floor neonatal section.
Upon receipt of the information, the neonatal doctor arrived at the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby.
At the time, the baby had a purple face and a lack of oxygen was suffocated, and the doctor gave him a pipe intubation immediately, and less than a minute later, the baby regained its heartbeat, the skin color gradually recovered, and the recovery was successful.
Upon admission, the 32-week baby was placed with a life-saving respirator, sustained rescue and smooth breathing, which was successfully evacuated the following day.
After a week of treatment, the baby ' s vital signs are currently stable, breathing is smooth and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal unit of the hospital received three premature births on its way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born on a 120-week first aid vehicle, all of which were 29 weeks of premature births and are currently actively treated in the neonatal unit.
Mr. Sun Guoqiang, obstetric director of the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Centre, introduced the fact that, in recent years, women and children in the province had attended to a large number of babies born on the subway in private cars, a situation which could threaten the lives of their mothers and children.
Director Sun warned that pregnant mothers should visit the hospital immediately in the event of abdominal ache, broken water, red eyes, etc.
In the event that the child arrives at home or on the road, the mother shall be as flat as possible and may be provided with blankets and so on under the hips to prevent the baby from falling back into the ground, and the child shall be kept warm as soon as possible and shall be brought to medical care as soon as possible.
The newer aeronautics company is officially operational.
The establishment of VSTEA was one of the fine-tuning elements of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 between VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the emergence of the first Vietnamese aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
Two leading aviation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperated to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to national and international airlines.
Viet Nam’s general manager, Yang Zhisheng, said that the company’s associate, ST Engineering Aerospace, was the largest and highest-level aircraft maintenance group in the world.
The cruise is confident that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides and is the beginning of a promising future of cooperative relations between the two sides.
Lim Serh Ghee, the Managing Director of ST Engineering Aerospace, stated that the sharing of extensive experience with ST Engineering would help the consortium to provide international-level maintenance and repair services and contribute to the flight safety of the airlines.
The birth of VSTEA contributed to a deep and wide-ranging approach to the market for the maintenance and repair of aircraft equipment with the potential to excavate.
At the same time, there is a great opportunity to access modern technology and to train senior aviation technicians.
As a result, the sustainable development needs of Viet Nam ' s aviation industry are better met.

A penalty of up to three points?
On 27 Beijing time, the NBA Development Alliance announced a pilot new penalty, with only one penalty at a time, the value of which is determined by irregularities.
O'Neill has a very low penalty shot in the NBA ball star.
The new regulation provides for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points and 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for offenders and 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for offences.
The last two minutes of regular time and the extra time competition follow the previous penalty rule.
While this new season is only being tested by the NBA Development Alliance, fans are more concerned about the implications for current players if it is introduced in the NBA.
For the time being, many believe that the new rules may be in favour of Hadden the Bigbeard, and that the penalty is less than that of James, who is going to suffer.
Wuhan's promotion of industrial intelligence has given up to $20 million in subsidies.
On 27 September, journalists learned from the launch of the “Present to the New China Games” series, organized by the Vuhan City Press Office, that since this year the city has accelerated its industrial intellectual transformation and implemented a transformational subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of more than 800 industrial enterprises.
Mr. Zhang Hong, Deputy Director of the Department of Economics and Informatization, Wuhan City, introduced the action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises starting this year, providing free advisory diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of higher size than demand, and promoting a new round of high-level technological transformation of enterprises in all its aspects.
In accordance with the plan, every year the city of Wuhan publicly selects a group of specialized diagnostic services to carry out a needs-based smart transformation survey for all industrial enterprises of the city ' s size and above, through the creation of columns, questionnaires, reports, etc.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises, accounting for almost one third of all industrial enterprises in the city as a whole and above.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be placed in enterprises to conduct “one-on-one” field assessments and programme validations.
Zhang Hong reported that the city was currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects with a total planned investment of 29,760 million yuan, and that the construction of leading smart workshops and intelligent factories in industries such as the 5G Smart Production Line, the Motorola National Lead Smart Cellular Production Line, the Wuhan Si Men Sub transformer Digitally Unmanned Plant, the National First Quantified Satellite Production Line, the New Veterinary Intelligent Production Line back home to the Bioworld, the European Intelligent Household Network Smart Production Line, etc. had been initiated.
In addition, the city of Wuhan has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include investment in industrial enterprises that are intelligently modified and actually completed; investment in equipment hardware, and soft investment in R & D, with a transition grant of 8 per cent, up to $20 million.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Active Joint Exchange and the Wuhan Branch of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide individualized financial services tailored to the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises and significantly ease the pressure on corporate finance.
Trudeau, "Pull Man," can he be re-elected?
This time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudeau, who dressed himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, provoking a wave of violence in Canada.
After what happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy much.
Trudeau sort of moved a rock and smashed his own foot.
As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the “anti-black-face movement” in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within the party of “substantial losses” in this regard, and have repeatedly claimed that “anyone who makes such a mistake should be dismissed immediately.”
Simply put, this time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
Trudo, the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudo of Canada, is young and handsome, with a “political idol” cyclone in the early days of his journey.
Formerly “political” he, after taking over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 – the Federal Liberal Party, half of its seats in the Federal House of Commons, gained valuable separate governmental power.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of political platforms, concepts, such as “ethnicity and gender equality”, “eco-environmental environment”, “economic revitalization”, and emphasis on the eradication of corruption and “irregular winds”.
However, for five years in office, he has been “high and low” in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In terms of “ethnicity and gender equality”, leaving aside the “black-face” incident, he “cann’t speak for himself” on a range of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Hills of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s founding.
With regard to the fight against corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling “Ranving” incident.
It was exposed to major irregularities and abuse by its home construction and engineering company, Ran Wanling, and pressured the authorities and officials in charge of the investigation to demand that the latter be “high-handed”.
Moreover, Trudeau’s anger over the disclosure of malpractices – the formerly mentioned by Wang Chau-di – was the Attorney-General of Canada when he was the first to disclose the malpractices.
Although the case itself remains questionable, it is difficult to erase the suspicion.
According to many observers, the collapse of the Trudeau regime for five years was largely the result of its own “powdering pits”, the largest of which was the “dips of the tiger” and the “broadness of the ruler”.
The most authoritative Angus-Reed poll data in Canada show that, from 2015 to the present, those who supported Trudeau slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while those who opposed jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Although the other opposition parties and their party leaders also perform poorly, even a significant proportion of the voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party (FLP) are now not convinced of the Federation Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat the great victory of five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficulty.
Both the corporate competition dimension, the consumer experience dimension, regional aviation integration, and the development integration dimension of Kyoto have far-reaching and positive implications.
On 25 September, Beijing Daesing International Airport was officially launched.
New Kyoto newspaper journalists have been informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Rehabilitation Board that the capital airport is already operating in a state of oversaturation and that the opening of the capital's international airport will enhance the capacity of the capital's air services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our common city, similar to Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which serves mainly domestic aviation, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, and the future capital airport and Da Hing Airport, which will also provide a more disaggregated service based on differences in service to different air operations, both domestic and international.
The navigation of Da Hing airport is more beneficial for the capital airport from the point of view of operational development.
The capital airport, which passed 100 million through 2018, is the country ' s largest in terms of passenger throughput, but there are still significant shortfalls in capacity compared to the fast-growing operational demand, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, travel, etc., and in keeping with the growing trend towards open and internationally integrated cities in Beijing, Dae-Hing International Airport has been established as a large international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million annual passengers and 4 million tons of mail and mail.
As a result, there is no overlap in the positioning of the two airports, targeting different client groups, and there is sufficient market space.
At the economic and financial level, it is clear that the navigation of the International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing the tension in Beijing's aviation capacity, accelerating the rate of passenger and cargo throughput and building incremental cakes for the two-nuclear operation of the capital.
From the user ' s point of view, as the international airport moves through the capital, it is not necessary to concentrate all future trips on the capital airport, but also to reduce the range of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing the length of aircraft and passengers ' stay at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations, reduced shipping through the capital airport and, in fact, improved passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of the various transport routes to the major international airports, such as a direct high-speed drive to the Greater Euphoria airport from the South Ribbon, with 50 minutes to drive, the fuel money will be around $40 and the high-speed cost of $15, while the orbital traffic metro airport line will be selected for a distance of 20 kilometres and 30 kilometres, with fares of $10, $25 and $35; and the citizens will be able to travel from Beijing West Station to the Dae Eing airport station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, there are a wide range of transport options available for citizens to go to Da Hing airport, within a reasonable range of costs and time.
On the other hand, from a trend point of view, Da Hing airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyoto, thus a little further from the city of Beijing, but increased radiation exposure to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, is of great importance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from the increased international air route service provided by Da Hing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of the Da Hing Airport.
Accompanied transport facilities at Da Hing Airport are very well developed and, in addition to the new airport line in the city of Beijing, which leads to Da Hing Airport, there are several highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
As in the case of the cities of Guangdong Dongdong, Fuoshan, Kiang and China, passengers can travel to the White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou via the Guang Buddha, Guangdong and other highways, residents of such places as the Beijing Ribbon, the Yu Anjin District, etc., will also benefit from the Great Euphoria Airport, which provides easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the opening of the International Airport at Dahin is not merely an addition of runways and aircraft, but is far-reaching and positive, not only in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, but also in terms of regional aviation integration, and the development of the integration dimension of Kyoto. It is not only about the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also about the diversification of options for the movement of a large number of residents in Kyoto, as well as the further improvement of the quality of services in the shipping industry in Beijing, which is more conducive to the integrated development process in Kyoto and to the economic and trade development in the vicinity of the airport.
Therefore, with regard to the opening of the airport, we need to make an economic score not only for the individual, but also for the overall development.
On the 27th of mid-day, the tiles rose by 1.46 % - Xinhuanet
On September 27, Xinhua's Shenzhen electricity (journalist Zhao Rish) moved high and high on the mid-point finger on September 27, with a final collection of 6077.23 points, an increase of 87.55 points, or 1.46 per cent, over the previous trading day.
On that day, the sum of $108 billion was paid, which is $31.9 billion less than on the previous trading day.
Of the stocks traded on the same day, 668 stock collections were up and up and 15 were up and down, while 222 were down and 4 were down and 4 were down and 40 were flattened.
In 2019, the Forum on Economic and Social Issues of Viet Nam was held in the province of Yunten.
The Vice-President of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejong, revealed that, at the beginning of the year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development had seen many new developments and continued growth.
The forum focused on economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants held an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes, namely, economic development in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese socio-cultural context in 2019, and projections and recommendations for the socio-economic development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased in the first months of 2019.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world ' s economies had stagnated in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development had achieved many promising results, with a smooth macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, with an average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In forecasting trends in Viet Nam ' s economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of Viet Nam ' s National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre, Dundeyn, stated that, against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy, Viet Nam ' s economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomic stability is expected to remain generally stable, the implementation of the various FTAs will contribute to trade development, the restructuring of the economy and the improvement of the business environment have been further strengthened, and Viet Nam ' s external export activity will decline as a result of trade friction.
There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam ' s exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation is kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and eco-agriculture, among others.
Liu Ji Jie, Director of the Consular Office in Siem Reap, Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jie said that, 70 years after the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs and contributed more to China ' s intellectual and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30 per cent to world economic growth, in particular to China's “one-way” initiative, and that cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the Territories was deepening.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian relations, with fraternal friendship and friendship between the two countries, and that mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia would be the driving force behind the local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Dishiah, highly commended the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the results of their friendly cooperation.
Desaikha looks forward to continued joint efforts between the two sides to promote Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and to continuously improve the living standards of the people.
Disah said that Siem Reap's friendly relations with China's provinces and cities had been remarkable, that friendly relations had so far been concluded with China's 28 provinces and cities, that the large cultural performance projects, "U's smile" and "U's dynasty " , had landed, that the Siem Reap-Gangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport project, the Siem Reap Government officials' special training course, the Siem Rey University Scholarship, rural consultations, the re-engineering of urban roads, the Cataract Rehabilitation Public Service project, etc., had been fruitful, and that the Siem Reap people had become direct beneficiaries in the context of friendly cooperation in Cambodia.
The reception was attended by the Minister of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the five prefectures, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap.
To witness the 10 years of digital China's "The Clouds" - Xinhua Network in Cloudy Town.
Using the 2009 local website forum as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress, held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27, has gone through a decade.
From the concept of “in the clouds” to the practice of “in the clouds”, big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over a decade.
At the Jin-tae PV cell workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, a new “coworkers” with AI's artificial intelligence were recently loaded next to the Quality Inspector.
It is open for 24 hours, is identified at more than twice the rate of manual labour, and the accuracy of the quality check is stable at more than 95 per cent.
According to the head of the company, the Quality Checker, with the camera, has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery fragments classified.
This enterprise is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing support manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatics published the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of Corporate Clouds (2018-2020), which aims to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and motivation of enterprises by 2020, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of their applications.
The founder of Ariyun, King Ken, said that today, data-centred cloud computing has opened the way for the data to bridge the digital economy of key elements.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on cloud computing development (2019), published by the China Institute of Information and Communication Research in July of this year, showed that the total market size of China ' s cloud computing in 2018 was 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation and digital economic development, invisible “clouds” have unwittingly transformed urban governance and social life.
At this year's Cloud Habitat Congress, the “city brain” of three years in a row continues to be a cause for concern.
The Aliun side described that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a traffic governance tool, and that the related collaborative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain achieves new urban management service functions such as “busting before paying” “real-time perception of the number of clients”, “tourism route design”, through a strong computing capacity.
In the area of government services, “one thing” is to be replaced by “one cloud” and “one thing” is to be implemented in a coordinated manner, with cloud computing facilitating the supply of government services on both sides.
Zhejiang has now established a province-wide common public data platform through the cloud of governance.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate entities in the province, bringing together 3066 categories of 19.8 billion data.
On average, 12 million monthly calls and shared data have been made between the Zhejiang provincial government departments, and the flow of data over the " Clouds" every time the data is called may mean that people do less.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic tea bag!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada in recent days found that a plastic tea bag could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a single person's estimated entire intake of microplastics, but to date there is no evidence that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that immersing plastic tea bags into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95°C), will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the total estimated number of microplastics taken by a person.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, at least 50,000 plastic particles are eaten annually, while the same amount of microplastics is inhaled.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Montelo Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bag and immersed it into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analysed it using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag emitted more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “a number of levels higher than the plastic load of other previous foods”.
It has been reported that most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands of tea bags made of natural fibre still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based, but instead use plastic, which is the subject of tests by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastic, and researchers define these microplastics as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 m2 and are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnia and led to developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO notes that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread to the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released from these tea packs may be due to the exposure of these plastic tea bags to boiling water, and may decomposition or seepage of toxic substances even when the “food grade” plastics heat up to 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres stated that climate emergencies were the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About one quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Climate Action Summit, small island developing States are jointly committed to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus once again leading the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old injustices.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming has been small, it has paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the planet — the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans and seas have suffered from the grave consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions are likely to experience some extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once a century a year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
The costs of pollution, overfishing and acidification are enormous.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also making efforts to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Guterres said: “The problem can be solved anywhere by addressing it in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can draw upon.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India indicated that the financial system was sufficiently mobile.
India ' s Finance Minister, Seetalaman, 26, stated that the current financial system is sufficiently liquid and that India ' s economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumer demand.
The above statement was made after a meeting with representatives of private Indian banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman does not state the purpose of these statements.
Some of the former Indian media and overseas media attributed the continued slowdown in the Indian economy to the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
The decline in car sales was cited as an example of West Talaman, which denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
According to Seetalaman, the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman expects the Indian economy to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India ' s annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has recently issued a circular to the effect that it is strictly forbidden for primary and secondary schools throughout the province to make up for the violations during the National Day Leave and to organize unannounced visits by personnel at random.
In its circular on the prohibition of state holidays, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education stressed the need for primary and secondary schools throughout the country to ensure, during the celebration of the National Day, that students are not allowed to organize group remedial classes or to attend new classes, that students are not allowed to organize courses of study, courses of special length, Osai, classes of interest and classes of higher learning, and that schools and school premises are not rented to other educational institutions for the conduct of various courses.
At the same time, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing, advising and inducing students to attend in- and out-of-school remedial classes, in-service primary and secondary school teachers to attend out-of-school training institutions or those organized by other teachers, parents, parents ' committees, etc., and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from presenting their sources and providing relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The circular makes it clear that, in the case of confirmed violations of remedial measures in primary and secondary schools, the local education administration will increase the deductions in the examination of quality development education at the district level in the same year, and that teachers involved in remedial violations will be dealt with in a serious manner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the teacher ' s and teacher ' s style.
Support for pig production, market supply.
Our loyalty requires the implementation of measures in six areas.
A telephonic conference on the supply of the market for the promotion of pig production throughout the province was held today to mobilize for the redeployment of the policy measures adopted by the Central and Provincial Councils and the provincial governments to support the production of pig production and to secure the supply of the market.
The faithfulness of the law requires the implementation of measures for the production of live pigs in six areas.
The mayor of the “basket of food” was responsible for its implementation, and this year a clear provincial mandate of 45 million live pigs was broken down to the municipal states to include a responsibility test.
Implementation of policy measures to effectively address the “last kilometre” of policy implementation.
The production of pig-rich pigs is being implemented, the policy of subsidies for pig-rich pigs is being implemented in earnest, the growth of pig-growing enterprises is being encouraged, and there is a systematic selection of good female pigs from the group of commercial pigs.
The promotion of investment is a top priority, taking into account the fact that it has not yet entered the country ' s well-known large-scale farming enterprises in our province.
The implementation of market circulation systems, the acceleration of the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for raw pigs, and the overall promotion of a shift from a “pig-to-meat” to a “meat-to-meat” system.
The implementation of the modern system of immunization will require the deployment of grass-roots quarantine personnel commensurate with the scale of the farm and the tasks of the work, as well as the establishment of the first line of protection against disease and disease.
Faithful demands that all efforts be made to secure the supply of the meat market, to ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and large-scale disconnections, and to ensure a smooth supply of pork for major holidays.
The meeting also deployed efforts to maintain the control and control of the African swine plague, a ban on retreats in key waters of my governor's river basin, and the acquisition of medium- and night-time rice throughout the province.
An old Shanghai word for the love of the country, the spirit of the nation, the rabbit, and so forth.
The "Me and My Fatherland" campus hits the pedestal to make college students feel happy.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Shanghai Old Letters, the Great White Rabbit, and the few others, gathered on 27th of the 27th day in Shanghai for the "Art Party" of the Shanghai Polytechnic University, four Shanghai Old Letters representing an average of more than 90 years in history, and Qi Qi told over 200 young scholars about the country's state and nation's spirits.
An exhibition of the old brand's products on the scene.
The narrations in the classroom made the students wonder that the display of the old branded product was carefully placed outside the classroom, and that the "Me and My Fatherland" campus had a punctuation point for the students.
Big hare lipstick, big hare ice cream as an old word brand, big hare milk sugar has been active in recent years, aggressive, innovating and cross-border.
The big white rabbit, born in 1959, happens to be on its 60th birthday this year.
Xin's life has also turned his eyes to youth consumption groups.
Wang Weiji, secretary-general and deputy director-general of the party branch of the Shanghai Pilgrim Food Company Ltd., referred to the scene of “Spring with abalone, summer with hot fish, autumn with blizzards with brittle shrimp, winter with brittle crabs” as a reflection of people's constant innovation in “eating”.
Companies have also further developed brand culture in terms of taste innovation, cartoon packaging design, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents a presentation of the path of innovation on the scene of the Art Party.
Shanghai Feathers, too, says, "All innovations are based on solid foundations, and the old word is that every innovation is a thick, thin-haired process.
Each and every one of us has a hidden expectation of the old word.
At the heart of the product, the age of small and beautiful should begin."
As one of the country's first `old Chinese' characters, Shanghai has also been able to adapt rapidly to market trends, with visual upgrading of brands, the introduction of professional operating teams and a significant increase in turnover.
“The old word is not only visible in these traditional channels, such as supermarkets, but now the old word is also actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, in the end, will be to make it possible for consumers to see, to hear, to buy."
Uyang Jail, Deputy General Manager, Soap (Group) Ltd., Shanghai, said.
In the future, Shanghai soap production will also persist in high-end development, with the systematic development of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products with broad prospects and user satisfaction, and on a high-tech, cost-effective path.
Through the art party class, the students gained a lot.
I grew up with the old word, with the good memories and emotions of my childhood."
I'm sorry, Mr. Song.
The Shanghai Old Letter represents the story of the motherland and the national soul of over 200 young students.
Xiao Xing said that how to excavate brand culture so that high-quality traditional culture can be inherited from one generation to the next is an issue that we, as design students, need to think about and explore.
Building on the “Shanghai Image” project of Ting Wei, Dean of the School of Arts of the University of Technology, China, and the “Old Words Integrating Brand Innovative Studio” of Professor Niang, the Party is looking to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the old word, using the competitiveness and influence of the Shanghai word to enhance the concentration of cultural radioactivity of the old word Shanghai, to achieve the industrial effect of the “1+1>2” in the form of “design + culture” and to present the Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite literaryists, painting masters, pottery masters, non-herding masters, architects, landscape masters to serve as lecturers, through which they tell stories about the innovation and persistence of the Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the times, strengthen the ideals of university students, foster their love for their country, speak with their works, make their works sound, in the form of innovate party classes, as subjects that students love, enhance the ideological, theoretical, affinity and relevance of the Party, increase the virulence of the Party's classes, and nurture the new generations who can assume the post of National Renewal!
Abe recorded a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, and said in Chinese:
On 26 local time, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan congratulated the People ' s Republic of China by video on the seventieth anniversary of its establishment.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I'm Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, China and China declared to the world the firm will of the G20 through the G20 Leaders Osaka Summit Declaration to make the summit a success.
In addition, at the Japan-China summit and dinner, prior to the summit, it was agreed that President Xi will undertake a State visit to Japan in the spring of next year, with the unanimous determination to usher in a new era in Japan.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that a new model of future relations between the two countries, working together to address the issues facing the region and the world and contributing to the international community, will be beneficial.
In conclusion, I wish Japan a vibrant relationship and friends a prosperous career.
“It is estimated that over-age farmers on some sites account for more than half of the total.
Where do we find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many "old people" on the site."
Recently, Zou Kui, a contractor working in the construction industry, lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers on the site (over and above retirement age).
In recent times, I have been working on rain-distribution projects in my high schools, where a large number of farm workers are present and, if observed, a large number of over-age farmers are found.
Farmer workers who are too old to go out to work are not “silent,” but rather because they are “not free,” and have the irritability and hardship – whether to save money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or to help their children – that forces these old people, who were supposed to be “silent,” to continue their hard work.
The "old-age" of the over-age farmers is not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, raising old people, helping children to read, helping children build buildings to buy cars, helping children to start a family, raising grandchildren from generation to generation, and when these farm workers complete their “life mission”, the bags have been emptied, even a lot of debts, and they mostly lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag children, but also to save some wealth for themselves, many farmers insist on “doing as long as they can”.
Many “after 80” and “after 90” and even “after 00” new generations of peasant workers are reluctant to engage in secondary or low-end services that are under difficult conditions and labour-intensive, creating structural “workless” jobs that are unattractive and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
As a result of a lack of skill and reduced physical and labour capacity, a number of over-age farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, and a little more is a little more, and the plight of the over-age farmers behind the "don't be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problems of wage arrears and wage bargaining, improving labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age farmers, in addition to their “self-help” work, is also dependent on the public sector's institutional care and human care.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are no longer likely to rely on their homes to grow land to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they must provide for their families through other means.
The insatiable and strong reading of the “freeness” of over-age farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the backs of over-age farmers, hearing their groaning, trying to get them back to the countryside to truly “live the old”, requires shared responsibility among the public sector, markets and society in a virtuous interaction, and multiple forces.
Chemetsov said that Russia would not export such a system for the next five years, because “first supply of its own military forces will be followed by export production”.
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their defence needs and then to process export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, General Yuri Glehoff, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Goldstone-Antai” Sky Defense Concern.
This is the new generation of anti-aircraft systems, using the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to certain information, S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, ultrasonic missiles five times faster than sound, even near space targets.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemetzov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defence system is in service with the Arctic Air Defence Regiment.
According to information received on 15 September, the reconfiguration of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Regiment has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the transition to more advanced defence tools in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the news service of the Russian Northern Fleet, “According to the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has significantly increased.”
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the system has been successfully used in the far north and the Arctic.
Air Defence Corps personnel trained in the new system and were prepared to enter combat duty.
The S-300 long-range air defence system, which had previously been equipped there, remains partially in place.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they high-speed targets in the outer altitude or “fish leaking” near protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the “Gold Diamond-Antai” Aerial Defence Concern, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, ultrasound targets and other aerial assault weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets at a range of 60 kilometres and 4.8 kilometres per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of the airspace of the northern sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 “Tor”-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence indicated that the Arctic “Tor” force would be extended to full brigade-size units in the future.
Together with the new S-400 remote system deployed on the New Earth Island and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence.
According to the Russian Government, the flagship shop will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
Rusty, a Russian store operator, focuses on the sale of Russian goods in China.
The biggest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communications Software Wechat, have online shops and own their own online platforms, Epinduo.com, and Russian retail chains.
The Russian Export Centre will work with Russian suppliers to develop marketing strategies and standards of participation in shops and screen virtual shelf-loading enterprises.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and to build up at least 10 products from Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month to China ' s power vendor platforms is as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are underselling.
As we all know, the attitude of Chinese consumers towards Russian goods is quite positive, considering our commodities high quality and green and green.”
Kozhevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said, “Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also bring on board the products of Russian Far East enterprises.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basics of Trade Policy, Plyanov Economic University, Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a State-owned, not a private, agency.”
“I have not seen a large number of highly competitive Russian goods in the market.”
He believed that the project would probably not be implemented in real terms, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises ' product information had been published on the largest international wholesaler platform, Alibaba.com, and could be purchased in China and elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, the training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Bounty, the first of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November of this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, where commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotions and meetings with Chinese business representatives will also be held.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
According to the Information Service of the Russian Export Centre, “In addition to the agricultural stand, we must also hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct links between entrepreneurs”.
“This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the Fair will hold master courses, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cook-cooked Russian-American food fairs on the project “Exploring the Russian Food Top Sea Station”.
Following the decision of the Mohamud Adi Coroner ' s Coroner ' s Court on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police waited for the full report and for instructions from the Attorney-General ' s Office to take the next step.
On Friday, the National Police Criminal Investigation Department issued a statement to the effect that, in accordance with the decision of the Coroner ' s Court, the police would await further instructions from the Attorney-General ' s Office.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never suspended the investigation into the Mohamud murder, which was still ongoing.
On the other hand, NOAA, Chief of Police of the State of snow, stated that the police would await a full report on the content of the relevant decision before taking action.
He responded in this way when he was asked about the matter on Friday morning, after attending the handover ceremony of the duties of the Deputy Chief of Police of the State of snow at the headquarters of the State Police.
He stated that the police had investigated the case on the basis of the relevant reports.
He added that the police would also look at the progress of the investigation and decide whether to call again those who had been taken earlier.
The journalist learned from the Beijing grove Greening Bureau that, in the recent 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, the city of Beijing, with Chang'an Street and its vicinity as its main axis, has comprehensively upgraded the landscape of the groves to create a climate of peace and joy.
At present, all of the 12 square flower altars along Chang'an Street have been completed, with 20 million gardens of flowers all over the city dressed as beautiful capitals and dressed to greet the national festival.
In the past few days, the 12 lilydo-style, tectonic landscapes along Chang'an Street have attracted a large number of objective public visits, as well as photographs.
These flower altars, with their distinct themes, began with the “brilliant 70 years” of the north-west corner of the nation's founding, and ended with the “good tomorrow” of the north-east corner of the revived gate, flaunting the remarkable achievements of the new China in all fields in its 70 years of existence and demonstrating the happiness of the people.
The head of the Beijing Parks and Forest Greening Bureau explained that the greening of the environment this year took full advantage of its own innovations and brought together new varieties and technologies, both domestic and foreign.
More than 230 varieties have been applied as a whole, including 16 autonomous breeds, 18 green anti-reverse new varieties and 11 indigenous plants.
The country's self-proclaimed "Cool and Fashion" and "Autumn Candy" and "Autumn and Autumn" are being used for the first time.
In an effort to celebrate the National Day, Beijing recently also undertook a comprehensive clean-up of the city-wide landscape green forest, replanting more than 12,000 logs, 230,000 shrubs and 2.3 million square metres of grass roots.
At the same time, 200 thematic flowerpots have been set up in important areas such as the city-wide roundabout, the Long An Street Extension Line, the Shan Memorial Site, the perimeter of the new airport and the perimeter of the major tourist attractions, with a total of 20 million basins of flowers planted, 10,000 small bouquets of flowers, 5,000 groups of cluster containers, and 15,000 flying boxes, which have resulted in the overall upgrading of the greening of the environmental landscape in the capital.

The U.S. e-smoking has killed 12 people, with 805 cases of lung damage.
According to the Central News Agency, on 26 local time, United States health officials stated that 12 people had died of e-smoking-related diseases throughout the United States and 805 cases of lung damage related to e-smoking.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States reported these figures and indicated that specific substances leading to the disease had not yet been identified.
However, most patients reported the use of electronic smoke products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, the main compound in cannabis that affected mental state.
The surge in lung cases is known to be related to the purchase of contaminated electronic smokers on the black market.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the above-mentioned 12 deaths occurred in 10 states from California to Florida, and the related 805 confirmed and suspected cases were notified by 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.
In the past three weeks, e-smoking has been banned in India and the United States of America, while in New York and Michigan it has been banned.
According to reports, the Trump Government intends to ban electronic tobacco products from all smells other than tobacco from October.
When's the next bus coming?
"The Internet + Smart Station" gives you a lot of credit.
On 27 September, the Nanjing Smart Traffic Union Goth map announced that the first Internet+Intelligent Stations in the country would be officially inaugurated in Nanjing, when 54 public transport electronic screens would be lit, which would completely upgrade the level of Nanjing's information services, increase the efficiency of public transport services and the mobility and well-being of the population.
In the past, the anxiety scene of the waiting car was presented almost daily at the bus stop.
It is difficult to predict the duration of the bus, the conditions along the bus and the location of the vehicle, and the issue of the public handover of the pain points needs to be resolved, especially in some major cities, where long commuting distances and complex traffic conditions during morning and evening commute peak hours have led to a persistently precarious rate of public transport.
To this end, Nanjing Wisdom Transport, in conjunction with the Goth Map, explored in depth the new orientation of Internet+Traffic services, and launched the country's first smart service project, the Internet+Intelligent Station.
According to the information received, the country's first Internet + Smart Stations landed in Nanjing, integrating the Grand de Gord data with the expected time of travel ETA algorithm for Goorde's vehicles, and relying on bus electronic stations and mobile Internet, major traffic data upgrades to achieve the ability of the two-end distribution of bus routes for bus smart stations + electronic maps, the expected time of the bus to the station, etc.
Through the Internet+Intelligent Station, Nanking citizens not only have easy access to the expected arrival of the bus, the real-time location of the bus and the number of stops at the current site, but also the three-colour visualization of the public transport route through the orange green, making the real-time situation of all the bus lines at the station clear.
Thanks to the “Internet+Intelligent Station” technology, the citizens of Nanjing have achieved easy and efficient public hand-over, such as “access to the bus on the way out, access to the bus on the bus, and information on the time of arrival at the destination on the bus”.
On the basis of the real-time bus information of the Internet+Smart Station, the choice of the most appropriate route for your travel, while at the same time providing for psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of the waiting vehicle, makes it easier to travel.
Xinhua Network for the first time in more than 30 cases.

Xinhua Times Review: Stand firm and follow our own path.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Age " , released on 27 September, answers: China ' s development has been successful over the past 70 years, essentially because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to development, the socialism of the Chinese identity, and have followed it with determination.
China follows its own path of development. It is the choice of history and of its people.
In recent times, in a climate of poverty and internal and external distress, generations of human beings have sought and followed the path of national salvation.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the reintroduction of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all thought about, tried, and failed.”
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path of Chinese identity in practice.
China ' s path was one of happiness for the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China can do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As stated in the White Paper, China ' s development path, which is consistent with China ' s national circumstances and adapted to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path, which they cherish even more in the face of the world.
The Chinese understood the logic of South Orange and understood that what was good for others was not good for themselves, but best for themselves.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the most remarkable miracle of the world.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, the “end of history” was famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist path of China’s identity has brought to an end the “end of history”, the collapse of the “China collapse theory” and the failure of the “socialist failure theory”.
China ' s success had boosted the confidence of the developing countries to become rich and powerful and had expanded the path to modernization of the developing countries, providing experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that wished to accelerate development and maintain their independence on a path that was consistent with their national circumstances.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of each country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.
China will not “enter” the foreign model, nor “export” the Chinese model, but will resolutely pursue its own path, achieve its own continued development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and governance, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a 66-year-old female worker had been dismissed by text message from the owner of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background, and the employer's practices were strongly criticized as “corrupt”.
The Board stated that the manner in which Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, the English name Eddie, worked at Wagga's store for more than 20 years was treated by her employees was “extremely unfair” and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had “wanted to fire me”, because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that “Mr. Wang had published a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums in the past”.
Among the job requirements listed in these posts, one said “the first Asian woman” and the other “the first Asian employee”.
The third post states that he is “more proficient with overseas people (sic)”.
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
Mr. Sams stated, however, that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent from one class for three years, and the missing amount is a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was “in fact unrelated to her conduct or performance”.
He said, “It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's advertisement for the job, the real reason why the defendant should dismiss her was that he preferred to hire employees with an Asian background.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act (FairWork Act), Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant.”
Mr. Sams stated that it was not appropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton's position, given his “horrifying” treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the competence of the Commission to consider whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, “I believe that the defense should have taken an irresistible, unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang “waiting” for the opportunity, which, in his view, would ‘prove’ the termination of the applicant’s employment.”
“He was wrong... a man who, in dismissing the applicant, completely ignored any natural justice and, astonishingly, his imprudent and grossly unjust perfunctory conduct.”
Mr. Sams stated that, although Foodworks is a small business, “it must be said, frankly, that no decent employer will dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case.”
He said, "It's shameful, and it's extremely unfair."
In the wake of the Golden Week, we've seen an increase in the number of passenger trains 175 - the China-New Network.
On 27 September, a journalist from Guangqan (Ko Jun Xu Xu Xu) from China's new network, Guangqiang, was informed by Guangqian that, in order to meet the needs of passengers travelling on the Golden Week on the National Day, the Guangqin will be driving an additional train in hot directions, bringing the total number of passenger trains to 175 on holiday days, which will increase overall the capacity to travel during the golden week's peak.
The Hiroshima Group will undertake a number of initiatives to provide passenger services during high-flow periods.
The three-storey security corridor was optimized at the south station of Guangzhou, with 12 additional security routes, with a total of 44 security corridors in the third-storey waiting room, and 19 self-help real-name validation devices at the south station of Guangzhou, with a total of 71, to facilitate the flow of passengers.
In order to ease the presence and congestion of vehicles on the south south road at the south station, three new parking lots will be opened at the south station in Guangzhou, with the addition of 1,000 additional parking spaces, to ease the pressure on the perimeter of the south station.
The Shenzhen North station will open a “high-trail” free green passage.
From 6 to 7 October, at the height of the flow, the A2 exit at Shenzhen North Station will be connected to the metro, with a free passage route to facilitate the movement of passengers arriving at the peak hours.
In addition, East and West Square will regularly set up the U-Color Heart Fast Pass to serve passengers who arrive at the station 15 minutes before driving, as well as special priority passengers.
On the eve of the Golden Week of the National Day, the All-China Nine Passenger Section conducted full-time training in operations to ensure that the entire crew working as a passenger learns about business, improves the quality of service, and ensures that the train attendants are of good moral character and a more professional standard of operating quality, performing every trip to provide better service to passengers.
Six people denied the sale of pseudo-macca paper, and the case was brought before the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, printed papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register, and a businessman at the rank of governor, passed the case on Thursday, and the magistrate approved the charges against trafficking in persons and trafficking in migrants and transferred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them, the defence lawyer who was supposed to represent the Chinese-Chinese defendant Le Zhenhua, as well as Congressman Ryer of Sunset Hole District, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant and ceased to be the representative counsel of the defendant, which was granted.
He states that he himself drew criticism from his political opponents by representing the accused, and that his party of action was also implicated.
He stressed that he himself was not afraid of any threat, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to defame the Action Party and the Greek Government or other Greek leadership, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He also stated that there was no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused and that, to date, the accused, Le Zhenhua, had not been convicted.
The six defendants, charged before the courts on 12 September of this year, denied their guilt and were not granted bail on remand in the face of numerous charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, two district judges, Noshahaha, and Mazlan, after the arguments of both parties, granted the prosecution ' s application to transfer the charges against the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in migrants ordinances in respect of the six defendants to the High Court for trial, while the charges of forgery of documents were to be heard on 3 October, pending the prosecution ' s transfer of the documents to the defence.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Order 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge therefore did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland - a unit of the Armed Police.
A unit of an armed police force of an average height of 1.83 metres was in a busy state of training at the military parade.
Shining spears, unique olive greens and red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
The day before, journalists walked into the party and felt the determination of the military police officers to always be party and loyal to the people, as well as their “honour above” love and pursuit.
“Dreams shine on a glorious life, writing the immortal legend of the new era ..” This is a team song by a team of soldiers and soldiers – Walking with the Fatherland.
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qui Xiaolight, 1.92 m tall, was particularly visible on the side team.
He has a deeper understanding of honour as the first flag of the former Armed Police Flag Guard.
The honor of the military comes from hard training.
Qui Xiao Guang, a flagr, has always been a high standard of training.
He was strapped to sandbags to shape, stuck to a second watch to practice speed, blindfolded to practice gadgets and steady with the wind.
In his “flag career”, there is a picture that remains unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony brought down heavy rains, while none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag rises, Xiaoqing feels deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qui Xiaoqiao was selected as the base soldier.
The base soldier and the flagman's movement standards are different.
Xi Xiao Guang explained that, while the movement of flagmen and benchmark soldiers was often more than 20 paces away, more effort was needed in training.
The base force is the first in the first row and directly determines the alignment of the formations.
After intensive training by the parade, he repeatedly kicked his legs on a daily basis and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, he won a round of applause at the exact scale and speed of the march.
Almost every member of the team has the same experience as Xiaoqing.
20 years ago, the father of the soldier Joo-Orient joined the group to celebrate the 50th anniversary.
In order to follow his father ' s footsteps as a member of the team, he was frustrated on one occasion, but never discouraged.
He said, “It is an honor for me to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, and to be seen by the party and the people in my life, and I will suffer anything.”
"The Master of Stability in the Capital" has eight large words in the blinds.
Mr. Wang Qian, the party’s members are all from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabineros – an army with a glorious tradition, with major tasks such as the opening of the country, the celebration of the National Day, the security of successive Party National Congresses, and the maintenance of the capital’s counter-terrorism operations. A large group of British models and individuals, such as the “flag guard” – the “war hero squadron” – have been created, and over 50 units and individuals have been given honours by the State Department, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police.

The 70-year development achievements of the new China are the result of the tireless efforts of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the hard work of foreign experts.
Over the past 70 years, a large number of foreign experts have come to China, joined the Chinese people in the cause of modernization and construction and made indelible contributions, which the Chinese people will never forget.
He noted that China ' s development is at the beginning of a new history, and that the Chinese people are working tirelessly to achieve the Chinese dream of a fully fledged Xiao Kang society, a great victory over the Chinese character of the new era, and a great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
China will insist on “development as the first priority, talent as the first resource, and innovation as the first engine”, and vigorously pursue innovation-driven development strategies to promote high-quality economic development.
The human being is the most innovative and dynamic factor, and China will accelerate the development of a large pool of strategic, international, scientific and technological talent, young scientific and technological talent and high-level innovation teams.

The country's railways are the deepest of the main wells to be dug to the bottom.
On September 27, Xinhua's Kunming (journalist Ding Yien), according to the China Iron Tunnels Group, Ltd., the country's first-largest railway – the Grand (Li) Ri (Li) Railway, the main well of the Gorlegon Hill Tunnel, the main well, which was successfully dug to the bottom on 27 September, broke the deepest record of the country's railway rigs by 762.59 meters deep.
In the construction of the tunnels, the wells can improve the ventilation of the tunnels, increase efficiency and guarantee the safety of the works.
“When successfully dug to the bottom, the main well of the Gorrigon Hill Tunnel No. 1, the main well, will contribute to the construction of the bottom of the well, open up multiple working surfaces for later construction, and speed up the construction of the entire Golgong Hill Tunnel.”
According to Song Tao, the construction of the vertical wells of the Goligon Hill Tunnel No. 1 was carried out using a well-drilling method, equipped with the well-drilling, well-drilling, winch, whole-move metal templates, the FJD-6A parachute drill, the Central Reclamator and other major specialized machines, resulting in a mechanized stream of “four-system” water, such as a mechanized excavator system, a swirling system, a suspension system, a strangulation system, a strangulation system, and a strangulation system, which resulted in a significant acceleration of construction progress.
It is understood that the Grand-Sweet Railway, which is about 331 kilometres long and is designed to be 140 kilometres per hour, is an important component of the Central-Myanmar international railway route.
The Gallegon Hill Tunnel, which is 34.538 km long, is the first long rail tunnel in our country.
A field view of the TV show Fox Hunt.
In the recent field viewing at Tianjin airport of the episode of the transnational investigation of the " Fox Hunting " , actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Guo filmed important scenes such as the escorting back of a fugitive economic suspect. The film was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The Fox-hunting team this time filmed the key scene at the airport that most showcased the results of the “Fox-hunting” law enforcement – the capture of fugitives, the taking of planes, the signing of arrest warrants, etc.
The group took a variety of shots from the tarmac, customs border control, and the passenger cabin, hatch, etc., and recreated China ' s difficult journey and professionalism to apprehend escaped criminals through multinational flights of police and fox-hunting heroes.
In order to successfully complete the film, the Fox-hunting team made a great deal of advance preparations, repeatedly confirming every detail of implementation and ensuring the most real and direct visual effect.
According to the information received, the play will also be filmed in a number of locations abroad.
Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities in terms of their level of preparedness to face the AI wave include prospects, capacity to realize, asset base and development direction.
The city of Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, responded to an interview with a journalist on behalf of Mohin Pevana, saying: “I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
Overall, I believe that the future of Viet Nam is bright in a context of high growth, strong economic development paths and rapid human resource development.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the fourth industrial revolution to promote more economic development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely transforming people ' s work, communication and way of life.
It brings with it greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are no cities in the world today that are ready for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Guterres expressed his pleasure to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China ' s founding here together, and congratulated the Chinese Government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.

Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala
On 26 local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala, on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
The King stated that, over the 12 years since the establishment of the Chinese-Ma border, relations between the two countries have developed in a healthy and stable manner, and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have steadily advanced.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutharika to the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, where the two heads of State held fruitful meetings and led the Chinese-Ma relations to the new steps.
China is ready, together with Malaysia, to continue to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of State and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and to promote the further development of practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is ready to intensify its communication and cooperation with Malaysia in international affairs in order to safeguard the common interests of the two sides and the overall situation of Central African relations.
Kassala stated that China was a true friend of Malawi and African countries and that its development had benefited the people of Malawi.
The Malaysian side adheres to the one-China policy and thanks the Chinese side for its support and assistance to Malawi.
Malaysia looks forward to the further development of relations between the two countries and welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in the country.
About 800 million people travel to China on the Fourth of July, refraction of Chinese tourist supply and demand.
About 800 million people will be traveling on the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Large-scale data from various tourism platforms show that the country ' s tourism consumer market is both a source and a source of prosperity.
The Journey Tour Report projects that, in the light of previous national holiday tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists this year will be close to 800 million; more than 7.5 million more trips will take place abroad.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities, through the platform, book products such as tours, free travel, custom tourism, local play, etc., covering 100 countries and territories.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, last year's national holiday was attended by 726 million domestic tourists, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
This year’s national holiday will not only be a new innovation in the number of tourists, but will also be the “mode” of the national holiday.
It is reported that the inter-provincial holiday in the country cost more than $3,000 per capita, an increase over the same period last year, as tourists generally choose to experience better products, such as high-rated brand hotels, shopping-free tours, elite groups, special coaches, etc.
A similar trend has been observed in the Donkey Mother's Travel Network booking data, where “principal groups” of less than 10 people are more popular than in previous years, using comfortable cars throughout the long line of the country.
Spring and fall tourism data show that their consumers prefer “slow-paced” experiences, service-oriented and differentiated approaches.
Flying pig data show that the country’s four-line and suburban tourist reservations are growing fastest, at a 30-per-cent rate on a year-on-year basis, refracturing the rising consumption of more parts of the country’s population.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's Golden Week.
Portfolio data show that the annual holiday rental car drive order is expected to increase by nearly 60% over the same year, while the short-distance drive of small groups of people visiting the perimeter continues to be acclaimed; the number of private group registrations increased by 155% over the same year.
The sharing of joy became the main purpose of people ' s tourism and leisure.
Portfolio data show that 28 per cent of the holiday visitors on the National Day were parent-child groups, 25 per cent were couples and 23 per cent were colleagues and friends.
Also, in terms of the age of tourists, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 per cent of the total number of visitors.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, the growth of the gold sector has been more rapid, and the domestic market has been more “optimal” this year.
Flying pig data shows that the number of people booking the country’s cultural and travel routes this year’s national holiday has increased by 42 per cent over the same year, faster than travelling abroad.
Industry analyses that, at the same time as demand flourishes, tourism supply side reforms are being promoted across the country, providing tourists with a richer “unsun feast”.
For example, the National Directorate of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently issued a joint release of the “Fine Lines for Sports and Tourism for the 11th Golden Week of 2019”; the Shanghai Tourism Festival, which is being held in 2019, has launched seven cultural and tourist spots to attract foreign and Chinese tourists; and, near the Golden Week, several provinces, including Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong, have introduced measures to reduce fares or provide free of charge.
Portfolio data show that the country's most “fired” destinations, with their unique natural or cultural characteristics, are Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

China is expected to become the largest export market for Australian beef.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that, following the outbreak of the African pigpest, China faced a severe shortage of pork and was expected to become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
In the wake of the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, resulting in the destruction of many herds by the authorities. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been halved and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world ' s pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst from the Dutch cooperative bank in China, demand for other meat, including beef, has increased, with China, the world’s largest animal-protein importer, currently importing 27% of world pork, and beef imports 24% of the world’s meat.
Ms. Ban said that, in the first half of the year, China had increased its imports of beef from Australia by 65 per cent, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government stated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Wang Yi: To help Africa achieve peace and security, China has never been absent.
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended an open meeting of the Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York on “Peace and security in Africa”.

The world's highest-age barber died at the age of 108.
In the United States, there is Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age barber certified in the King's world record in New York, who never retired to his daily daily hairdresser, but 19 days after Mansinelli passed away from his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mansinelli emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, helped to clean the floor in a barber shop, and began to pick up scissors to serve guests at 12 years old, thereby easing the economic pressure in the home.
Mancinelli, although attending primary school at the time, did not graduate.
The son of Mansinelli, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world loved him, but despite his health, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year and finally unable to work for physical reasons six weeks before he died, but that was not retirement, because he planned to come back and cut his hair when he was better.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new barber now after his father passed away, because he had to cut his hair for the rest of his life.
During the year, listed companies bought back more than $100 billion in historic heights - Xinhuanet.
In order to stabilize the value of the company, maintain the image of the company, and in the last two years, listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently, hoping to convey to the market the information that the value of the company is undervalued, through targeted buy-backs and a pool of competitive transactions, thereby stabilizing the value of the company and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern wealth Choice data show that the amount of money that listed companies used to buy back shares in 2017 rose sharply to 51 billion yuan in 2018 and that since 2019, the total amount of repurchase implementation by A-listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, bringing the historical high of repurchase capital by A-stocks, well beyond previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be on the same increase as that of the major shareholders, but it varies considerably in terms of the subject of the implementation, the source of the funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the equity interest in the stock itself.
In an interview with the Daily Securities Journal journalist, Xu Yang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that, in November 2018, the Opinion on Support for Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies, which addressed the problems of the current system, such as narrow repurchase of shares, complex decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, had significantly increased the number of repurchases in the year, as a result of previous policy incentives to repurchase of shares by listed companies.
In January of this year, the closing offices officially published the Regulations on the Implementation of Repurchase of Stock by Listed Companies, which broadens the sources of funding for repurchase by listed companies, streamlines implementation procedures, guides improved governance arrangements, and encourages listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.
Following the issuance of the opinion, the listed company performed the repurchase of shares, which became more applicable, the repurchase process was easier and the repurchase of shares was more motivated.
Repurchase of shares at relatively low positions also facilitates the efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the growth of major shareholders and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market value and cash flows.
Xuyang argued that undervaluation was a major factor in repurchases by listed companies, which no longer reflected their future development prospects, and that such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not invest blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial statements and the specific operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate their development confidence and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-listed companies has also led to a steady increase in repurchase behaviour, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented repurchases this year, and the leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the repurchase market.
China's recent announcement of repurchase progress in the near future states that the company has accumulated 57.559 million shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company's total stock stock, through a centralized competitive exchange, and that the total amount of funds disbursed amounts to $5 billion (excluding transaction costs). Repurchases will be used entirely for employee holding schemes, including, but not limited to, the long-term service plans that have been considered and adopted by the company's shareholders' general meeting.
Eli's shares have been paid $5,792 million for repurchase of shares and recently adjusted for repurchase of shares, with the planned “full repurchase of shares to be used as a source of later implementation of equity incentives” changing to “cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares to implement equity incentives, with the remaining 3,049 million shares to be used for write-off to reduce registered capital”.
The Ili shares indicated that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would further raise the level of return per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company ' s shareholders.
The TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on 25 September, which indicated that TCL had accumulated 3.39 per cent of the company ' s shares, at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to the Daily Securities Journal journalist that the repurchase of shares would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives or for converting into stock corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
The TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, constantly improving competitiveness and sustaining healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing, taking into account, inter alia, the performance of the company ' s second-tier market over the past year and taking into account the company ' s business and financial situation.
According to Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaitsu Foundation, the operation of stock buybacks by listed companies can, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the value of the second-tier market; and, on the other hand, the willingness of listed companies to come forward with real silver and write off shares from the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have been increasing in recent years, particularly for merit-based shares, and boosting investor confidence through stock buy-backs is a very good way, as well as a positive and encouraging practice.
Hunan Province’s Standing Committee and Changsha City Council’s Secretary, Hu Hshuhua, and the four main heads of the engineering and mechanical manufacturing army – Jan Jun, Liang, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei Xiang – set a “small goal” around “From engineering machinery to smart manufacturing” – three or five years later, creating a world’s leading cluster of engineering and machinery industries.
The construction of the world's leading engineering and machinery industry cluster in Changsha, in the current fashion, is “the strongest on the surface”.
As the capital city of the Inland Province, Changsha shouts this rhetoric, where's the anger?
It's based on the power of hegemonic leaks.
The four engineering and mechanical companies that took part in the dialogue, each with its own hands, covered the entire field of the sky, the ground, the sea and the land: the river's smart light aircraft, the concrete transport pump of the Central Atomic Section, the full-ground crane of the trio, and the tunnel shield of the iron-builder, whose “hard power” could be considered unique and proud of the males.
At some point, China had virtually no voice in the field of engineering and machinery manufacturing.
Time has passed away, and Chinese enterprises “introduction” “outwards” are driven by two wheels, taking advantage of the eastward winds of the “one-way” initiative, with a combination of acquisition, mergers, plant-building, etc., becoming a global engineering and machinery industry.
Among them, the three-pronged engineering and mechanical lead enterprises, such as the Central and Central United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the iron and steel construction industry, and the mountain and intelligence industry, led by key economic indicators such as the value of production, market ownership, sales and so forth, have taken a significant lead in similar enterprises.
It's time to move with the camera.
The "Four Great Kongs" of the Engineering Mechanical Army are the leaders of the cluster of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Industry and the leading enterprise in the global engineering and mechanical industry.
In the world's industry, who survives and lives well is the hard voice.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and mechanical manufacturing companies have fallen, but Changsha's engineering and machinery manufacturing industry has not only survived, but has also strengthened its body and bones by using “cat winter” as “winter swims”, by putting pressure on itself, by breaking through itself, by transforming its industrial structure and by transforming from manufacturing to ingenuity.
It’s because the moon’s politics are shared by the stars.
The development of industries of advantage requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for “the capital of engineering machinery” is that it brings together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of associated clusters of industries, and significantly reduces the cost of R & D, manufacturing and marketing by optimizing the business environment, improving the accompanying services, simplifying the approval process, and so forth.
Good business ecology has led to the proliferation of engineering and machinery manufacturing enterprises.
History has pushed the sand to the forefront of the construction of a global lead in engineering machinery.
Both Governments and enterprises, and even the relevant producers and researchers, should seize the opportunity, step up, target, sustain their efforts and contribute to building the power of the powerful.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China and the African countries were brothers and good partners.
China stands firmly with its African brothers, past, present and future.
We have advocated the convening of such a meeting of foreign ministers as a concrete step in the implementation of the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China's solidarity with African countries in the Council and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China ' s most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Security Council has always belonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China stands ready to work with African countries in the Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and to safeguard common interests.

The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the African States participating in the Conference thanked China for its initiative to convene the Conference and congratulated the New China on its seventieth anniversary.
The Ministers stated that the relationship between Africa and China is based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners to each other.
The African Group appreciates the important positive role played by China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, in African affairs, and its strong contribution to the just and reasonable resolution of African problems, as well as its great efforts and contributions to the defence of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
At a time when Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and enhanced solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus in today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the maintenance of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and hegemony; we all agree to strengthen mutual support and cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support the African approach to African problems and call for the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace” and help African countries to achieve autonomous and sustainable development; we all stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and oppose any State from creating obstacles to the realization of their right to development.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep came to "get out of poverty".
Autumn in September rewrite the yellow earth plateau.
The 58-year-old villager, Xavily, in a professional cooperative for the development of the people of the town of El Ma, filled the grub with the last herbs in the sheep's coop, standing by the trough and watching the white lake sheep chewing.
"Eat well, when the fall and winter are full, you can get a good price out of the column."
Xavier says he feeds the sheep every day with a special diet, regularly cleans, disinfects, and is careful to wait.
Xavier raised sheep for more than 20 years, and it was not until she came to work in the cooperative that she knew how rough herds were in the past.
Xavier Xavier is a member of the summer flood village in the town of Qingyang, Qingyang commune, Gansu province.
His right-hand neighbour is a sheep-breeding family, but adheres to the traditional way of scattering, the poor quality of the sheep and the low numbers.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined cooperatives under the guidance of the Government, and everything began to change.
Xavier Xavier spent all day working on farming because he was always holding on to it.
The stockholders, who were poor households, held the sheep in trust with the cooperative, were counting on him if they could divide the money and sell it at the end of the year.
It's good to have technical guidance, he's slowly learning to control the disease, he's mastering the science, and he's a small number of the village's farming.
A professional cooperative for the development of the common people is a standardized cooperative, with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake goats.
The cooperative leader, Zoutao, said that there were doors both inside and outside standardized sheep sheds.
"The wool is thick, so it can breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shantytown must be built in a three-sided ravine, and the wind changer must be installed to vent the evaporation."
Zoutao said that, in order to prevent the disease, it was also necessary to spray and disinfect the sheep regularly and give the sheep three to four times a quarter.
In addition to living well, the “fat sheep” have to eat herbs mixed with corn, wheat grass, aphids, etc., and have a sufficiently wide “park” to stretch their bones.
The cooperative, using a trusteeship approach, directs local farmers to place the good-planted lake goats here, unifying the breeding, management, marketing, breeding, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep share in their shares receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four documented card-poor clients work in cooperatives.
From the word “grazing” to the word “precision feeding”, from the word “local mating” to the word “ artificial insemination”, from the words “see the body, touch the belly” to the words “doing the B super by one” in Gansu Qingyang, goat farming is not merely a shift in the way of feeding, but the model of the “long business plus cooperative plus farmer” has changed the image of the once-daughter sheep, marketed sheep, overcoming the weakness of the traditional farming industry and the poor days of the farmers, which have become better as a result of modern sheep.
Zoutao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Shun Sheeng Farm Development Co. Ltd., would buy up at a market price of $27 per kilogram, helping farmers to spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., said that enterprises had led an increasing number of poor households to learn about the “goats” through the provision of credit guarantees, sheep farming, order farming, purchase of quotations, and integrated processing and marketing services to poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in their harvests through the cultivation, breeding, breeding, large-scale farming, the partitioning of slaughter, and the marketing of pastures in the “confederation”.
The city of Qingyang is located in a staggered northern agricultural belt, rich in herb resources.
Currently, there are 913 mammoth farms, cooperatives, more than 5 million goats, and two 1.3 million mammothed processing production lines have been built throughout the city, and the herds are becoming the “lead sheep” for poverty in the industry.
The French Chancellor says that next year there will be a tax cut of more than €10 billion, and calls on Germany to follow suit.
September 26th, Reuters Paris - French Chancellor Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by over 10 billion euros (US$ 10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France’s fiscal stimulus in order to revive its depressed economy.
In presenting the French budget for 2020, Le Mel stated that the recent ECB monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for the Governments of those member countries that were able to afford to invest more.
On September 12, the ECB reached a record low in interest rates, and plans to restart purchase debt in order to lower borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
“The low interest rate will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough,” Le Mel said to journalists.
“Germany needs to invest, it needs to do so now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until the situation gets worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
This year, France has implemented tax cuts of over €10 billion, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
The global economy lost its energy and the German economy, which was dependent on exports, bore the brunt.
Le Mel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Research: The U.S. National Healthy Diet Index has increased slightly, but still presents challenges - Middle New Net
According to the U.S. News Network, a recent U.S. study recently showed a moderate increase in the U.S. Government's healthy diet index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But with a full score of 100, it is not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face a “significant challenge” to their diet.
According to Dr. Zhang Fang, a researcher in nutrition at Tufts University, Massachusetts, one of the authors of the study, Americans continue to consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association Journal in 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government from 1999 to 2016.
The authors wrote, “In spite of the remarkable improvement, there are significant dietary challenges.”
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of food containing saturated fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, etc., by United States nationals.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.
The biggest improvement in America’s national diet is the drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intakes should be less than 10 per cent in daily diets.
For the reasons for the decline in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is associated with a reduction in the consumption of sweet soda, but Jang Fong stresses that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other all-grain food categories increased slightly among the adult population in the United States.
However, data for 2016 show that the share of these foods in daily diets is still less than 5 per cent.
Although the intake of salt has decreased slightly, and the consumption of juice has led to low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang aromatics indicate that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on bi-annual personal health surveys, which remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The government has published a dietary guide for residents of the United States to recommend a “healthy diet” to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guide states that more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs and seed food, can be produced as proteins, should be consumed.
During the research, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled, to over 7%, and the obesity rate also increased over the years – today, about 70% of the adult population in the United States is overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
The Forum was attended by members of the Viet Nam Central Political Bureau, the Secretary of the Central Registry and the Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping.
In line with the close cooperation between the European Union and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was “Combining the EU with Asia: Building Bridges for the Future of Sustainable Development”.
The Forum took place one year after the implementation of the twinning strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The Chairman of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that the enhanced engagement was part of the above-mentioned proposition, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wanted to convey messages about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is the special guest of the Forum and will make an important presentation in the plenary.
The country's first equity company, a financial subsidiary, was set up to run the business with the technology.
On 26 June, the Qwang Da Bank ' s wholly-owned subsidiary, Qingjiang Finance Limited, was inaugurated in Qingdao, the country ' s first joint-stock bank finance subsidiary.
The experts indicated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology, and that the establishment of financial subsidiaries by banks facilitated the use of science and technology to upgrade their operations.
In April of this year, the Bank of Guang Da and the Bank of Merchants issued separate circulars stating that they had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of a financial subsidiary.
On 24 September, Gwang Da Bank announced that it had been officially authorized to open its operations.
Just two days later, the Grand Bank led a number of stock-based banks and took the lead in establishing Qingjiao.
The Chairman of the Big Light Group, Lee Xiaoping, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation, using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, object networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage, use and penetration of financial capital, and improving client access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the establishment of the “Eight Pillar” for the sound development of financial science and technology in the country will further enhance the capacity of the financial sector to apply science and technology, achieve greater integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly increase the population's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Xuyang's Finance Committee, introduced that the Xujiang financial platform would use such technologies as intellectual investment, intellectual investment, big data, etc. to help Quang to better manage the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture the direction and trends from traditional to alternative to digitally alternative assets.
The National Laboratory for Finance and Development's special researcher, Dong Xijun, stated that, in the face of an entirely new competitive situation in the financial sector, the financial science and technology company and the financial institution would explore new growth paths with the capital and technology.
Financial science and technology enablers are both a need for financial science and technology to transform itself and, above all, will inject new life and dynamism into the development of financial services.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to upgrade its product research and development and wind control capabilities through technology and digitalization.
The new system began with product design, sales transactions, asset management, risk assessment and four major capabilities to upgrade the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
It was argued that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovative and rich products, IT can also enhance risk preparedness and efficiency in management.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that the risk preferences used to locate clients through a questionnaire were easily biased and that the current use of artificial intelligence for user drawings helped to better locate clients and to roll out products in line with their investment preferences, as well as to mitigate risks.
"Alternative big data, such as electric power, space and space data, can help us better carve a region, an industry’s dynamism, landscape. "
Zhang Xuyang said that, while addressing risks, big data technology would also help to upgrade wind control capabilities.
The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnels has been updated.
After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction on the 27th of September (Jan Wei Ming, the nation's Jianbo), the construction of the Grand (Ri) Ri (Li) Railway's Sant'Ligon tunnel, well No. 1, was completed on 27th, deep to 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the deepest record of Chinese railway tunnels.
The 34.5-kilometre-long Grand-Swee Railway Golligan Hill Tunnel, located in Yunnan, is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia across the Golligan Mountains in the West Bank.
The tunnel crossed 19 fracture zones at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, since it covered the undesirable geological and significant risks that could be encountered in almost all tunnel construction, known as the “Geological Museum” of the tunnel.
The erection of the wells, the most important auxiliary tunnel in the Goligon Hill Tunnel, has the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve “silence” and later ventilation for the operation of the railway.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marks the construction of the formal entry-level tunnel of the Gorlegon Hill tunnel, which, after the opening of the sub-drill garage and the replacement of equipment, will add four fields of operation to the well and accelerate the opening of the tunnel.
“The wells are all over the granite layers, and, because of the large gaps in the granite layers, they cannot stop the water, they keep flowing from the top to the bottom, and basically the depth of the well is as high as the water pressure.”
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railways Project of the Central Iron Tunnels Authority told journalists that, in the course of the construction of the well, there had been a number of dangers, such as mud and water surges and collapses, and that the builders had invited experts to carry out on-site pulses and over 20 discussions on the treatment programme.
“The maximum influx of water in the wells is more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres of the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres of the sea floor.”
“If the drain is not pumped in time, the well will be flooded by 10 meters in an hour, we spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment, and 15% of our time on digging.”
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically controlled development of the rig 1 fence, slurry water rush, water-rich granite, etc., tunnel construction uses a combination of “detection, injection, excavation” systems to treat water and reduce the risk of construction.
As a result of numerous improvements, the construction of the first rig created a mechanized water flow line, such as an excavator system, a puncture system, a suspension system, a winch lift system, and a full-process mechanized operation, such as eye beating, bursting, shattering, template installation, concrete construction, etc., and accelerated the construction process.
Ultimately, after more than 1,200 day and night works, the rig successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The Grand Swe Railway, which is 330 km long, is an important part of the international corridor in Central Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the “one-way” construction.
With the construction of the bus, the travel time between Dalian and Reilly will be reduced from six hours to two hours on the current road, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Farsi region, and will facilitate trade and trade cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries.
Lin Jung-seok: As a Chinese, he was proud of his country's achievements.
The Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary of the National Day.

In his message, Lim Jung-hoon noted that China, as a Chinese nation, was proud to have moved forward over the past 70 years, despite the many difficult challenges that it had faced, and to have overcome its excesses, and to have achieved achievements that were well known to the world as a whole.
Hong Kong's return to its homeland has always been a strong link with the Mainland, moving forward together and sharing fruitful results.
It is believed that under the premise of “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong will continue to have an advantage in the future, taking advantage of the opportunities of the “one way” and of the Greater Australasia District of Hong Kong, with a view to finding a better future for Hong Kong.
She also stated that over the past few months Hong Kong's society had been plagued by controversy, and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is to be hoped that the press friends will continue to face the challenge, be professional, provide fair and balanced press coverage for the society and do their part for the future of Hong Kong, and for the community to return to the dialogue of rational communication.
In his message, Chon said that the glorious journey of the new China was also a journey of development, progress, blood ties, honour and solidarity between Hong Kong and the motherland.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to its homeland, the Central Government has steadfastly pursued the principles of “one country, two systems”, “Hong Kong is governed by people” and a high degree of self-government.
To that end, the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
He stated that over the past three months, a series of violent acts, in flagrant violation of the law and wanton destabilization of society, had been perpetrated in Hong Kong, facilitated by the publication of distorted and false reports by some media outlets.
He called on the media to raise awareness and create a favourable climate for the population to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media professionals adhere to journalistic and professional norms, use real reporting and responsible speech to guide citizens to self-intention and violence, and uphold the fairness and supremacy of the law.
Some 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the wine fair and joined the guest of honour in a toast to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The journalist learned from the Xining City Council's Advocacy Department that the City of Xining will be implementing the Regulation on Promotion of Civility in the City of Xining on 1 October, focusing on 15 uncivil acts, such as pedestrians who do not follow traffic lights and throw objects out of buildings, setting out a list of key governance issues and imposing appropriate penalties.
Wang Xing Bin, Deputy Minister of Communication and Director of the City Civilization Department of the Sining City Council, introduced the marked improvement in the culture and morality of civil civilization since the city of Sining won the title of the nation ' s civilized city in 2017.
But uncivil behaviour, such as pedestrians crossing the streets, breaking through red lights, non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights, high-altitude objects, window objects, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing local defecation, is still prominent and prone to rebound, and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
In conjunction with Sinning's reality, the regulations impose more comprehensive and higher standards on the norms of civilized conduct of individuals and units, from public places, public order, public facilities, public sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, the building of civilized campuses, the promotion of civilized families, the performance of public duties, the remembrance of heroic martyrs, medical services, etc., and make society as a whole aware of what can be “advocacy” and what is “prohibited”.
“Promote regulations to eliminate blind spots and misperceptions in the field of civic behaviour, and provide a strong guarantee of the rule of law for the normalization of the work of popular spiritual civilization in the city of Sining, through comprehensive regulation of citizens’ behaviour, homekeeping, meals, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, wedding funeral rituals, etc.”
The Secretary-General of the General Committee of the Sinning City People's Congress said that he was in a state of hostility.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple from Wales, England, took two children on vacation to France and accidentally threw the car keys into the lake. The family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September, local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, the daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the keys to the car in it fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the key.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists purchased insurance prior to their departure, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of being stolen.
They had to hire a trailer to pull the car to a garage and store it, and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally obtained the fabricated key and the couple left France with the children.
They were forced to cancel their scheduled journey because of the loss of car keys.
Saudi Arabia officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China.
Since that date, the Kingdom has officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China, at a total cost of SAR 440 (approximately RMB 836).

Pilot notification of commitment systems in areas such as licensing of food production in low-risk varieties, decentralization of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Municipal Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of work with the Government of Pudong Novi District, introducing 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pilot projects throughout the country.
It was stated that the notification of the promise referred to the fact that the administrative authorities, when dealing with the registration of permits, informed the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements laid down in the laws and regulations.
Once the applicant has signed a promise, the administrative authority may take it directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong New Region and the Shanghai Free Trade Trial Area, permit the production of simple, low-risk food varieties, and provide a system of notification of commitments in three pilot areas, such as partial metrology equipment type approval, to facilitate business access.
Shanghai Xiaowan Living Food Co. Ltd., 27, obtained the Food Production Licence on-the-spot by means of a promise notification, becoming the first company to benefit from the pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that the “admissibility” approach, which allowed the enterprise to submit part of the information in accordance with the deadline agreed in the declaration of commitment, was “really perceived as facilitating the reform.”
Shanghai market regulators indicated that the system of notification of food production licences was a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from six previously “Registration, Reception, On-Site Verification, Sampling, Examination of Materials, Approval of Documents” to three “Registration, Reception, Approval of Documents”, with the completion time being reduced from 20 working days prior to the reform to immediate closure.
Taking into account the high outward orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated the registration of the permanent representative of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Area to facilitate the proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 were processed in accordance with the new regulations.
“11” Long-term fake consumer survey: choice of more diversified tourism takes first place.
The long holidays for the National Day are approaching, and people ' s vacation plans are gradually being finalized.
In recent months, the Daily Securities Journal journalists have launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the “XI” holiday arrangement, and nearly 20 feedbacks indicate that, while the plans vary, “tourism + consumption” became the key word for the “XI” holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the Daily Securities Journal journalists, more than half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that “the XI period was planned to take his family to Shanghai, while Mr. Disney was the first stop and then went to the surrounding cities”; that Ms. Lee's family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, “a family leaving on September 28th, planning a 10-day tour of the island”; that Ms. Ma in Chongqing planned an out-of-country tour, with Singapore as his destination; and that Mr. Zhang's family in Hebei chose to travel on their own, saying that “the daughter is under two years of age, it is not easy to leave the country, and plans to travel to Shandong on her own for a few days at sea”.
A recent report on the trends of residents travelling and travelling on the Golden Week of 2019, published jointly with the same tour, shows a clear upward trend in consumption in the three subsectors of travelling, living and travelling on the Golden Week of the National Day this year.
There has been a steady increase in the penetration rate of aircraft, high-iron travel, as well as an increase in the demand for star hotels, personalized unmarked accommodation.
On 23 September, the United States Mission published a report on tourism consumption trends for the 2019th National Day, which showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed an upward trend in “live-in” diversification.
More young people travel for high-quality, distinctive experiences, and the heat of cultural tourism, night tourism, etc., continues to rise.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumption demand were released centrally during the “XI” period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the daily Securities Journal reporter, “The main plan of this year’s ‘XI’ is to buy a car.”
The staff of a Beijing car brand 4S shop said to the Daily Securities Reporter that, in general, the months of September and October of each year were referred to as the golden period for the sale of cars.
During the “XI” period, a number of events will be launched, such as drawings, placements, etc.
A number of brands have also recently introduced new models, and the boost to sales of new products is expected to be more visible.
In the context of rising consumption trends, greater emphasis has been placed on the need to meet the spiritual dimension, with rising consumption of services such as culture and education.
Ms. Dou, who lives in Beijing, said that “since the birth of a child, culture, education and consumption have become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year’s ‘11’ is full, going to the ‘card’ planetarium, the children’s theatre, some family weekend camping in tents at the elk’s museum, and some experimental lessons.”
According to the industry, in theory, the population ' s consumption is escalating along the path of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and enjoyment, with a large share of the enjoyment consumption falling within the category of service consumption.
As the country ' s economy continues to grow and the income levels of the population rise, increasing attention is being paid to the need for consumption at the spiritual level, and tourism, travel, is a good way.
In particular, the long holiday of the Eleventh National Day, with ample time and a greater willingness to travel and consume, is a reflection of both the spiritual demand for consumption and the rising consumption of the population.
The afternoon began with loneliness and unwillingness to leave the house, and the children's absence has not yet been adjusted.
Get a grip, and say to the dog, "Mom, take you out of the house."
She wrote a few details about what she had to do, and the character of type A blood was getting stronger, and she felt uncomfortable.
Take a suit, buy nutrients, pay, buy raw fish, Nana's snacks.
That's the reason for going out.
On the phone, thanks to the fact that you've just finished your love for your sister, there's no excuse for buying snacks.
They laughed a couple of times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
Nana, who jumped on the sidewalk and fell down honestly, knew that she was sick, scared and unattended to stay with me.
Her husband, Boo, came back early.
Even the salad, which sighed with the salmon, was delicious, and then went to the bedroom to watch TV on the bed.
A glance at the wall, just at 7 p.m., the sun sets early in the sunrise, and it's dark.
The month was invented in the circle of friends, and today is Mid-Autumn.
Washed a bunch of grapes sent by a friend, left half to Boo, and left it in the little flower bowl that I liked, and took out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and I ate grapes, and she ate skins, and I vomited grape seeds far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, so as to be able to walk on the clouds, the moon will suddenly appear, and the darkness will be a little sharp.
The verse of the moon is rife in the brain, and only clearly likes it: every three or five times a week, a round of light-guarding the jade fences/the last round of the sky.
Perhaps we have given the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God, and the word of Caesar belongs to Caesar is the best.
The moon goes to the moon, your emotions go to you.
After eating the grapes, it's cold and cold.
The Nana Regiment, with a slight snoring by its feet, stood up and laid Nana's little blanket by her little house, on which Nana was happy.
Pull the door and shout, "Does the bath water burn?
The windows in the bathroom can't see the moon. They can only feel the moon, turn off the lights in the bathroom, and pull the glass out.
No mooncake, no drink.
A mascot was released at Dubai Expo 2020.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon images, including two Emirates children, three flying robots and a United Arab Emirates bean tree.
The launch presented information on six mascots to the audience through a short video film.
A 9-year-old boy, Rashid, and an 8-year-old girl, Latifa, are brothers and sisters, representing the people of the United Arab Emirates.
Three robots correspond to the three sub-themes of the present Expo, blue robots for "mobility", green robots for "sustainability", yellow robots for "opportunity".
An ancient bean tree, named "Salama", is the "grandmother" of five little boys, symbolizing the ancestors who defended the land.
Ahmad, Chairman of the Dubai High Council of Expo, said that mascots could strengthen emotional ties between large-scale events and participants, “believing that the mascot of the Dubai Expo will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, demonstrate the creativity of indigenous talent, and express our ambitions and expectations.”
The launch was attended by the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Chief Mohammed of Dubai, Crown Prince Hamdan of Dubai, the Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, and the Director of the Dubai World Bureau, Lim Hashimi.
The Dubai World Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, on the theme “Communicating ideas for a future”.
This will be the first World Expo to be held in the Middle East region.
Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of their high school results.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign qualifications, announced on the Network that, starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of high school results, without first having to enrol at domestic universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates who wanted to apply for German universities had to study a semester (211,985) or three semesters (general undergraduate) in their country, and passed the APS or the Testas.
The publication of the new regulations may save at least six months for Chinese students who wish to study in Germany.
It was informed that the new regulation would enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to complete 12 years of regular compulsory education with a certificate of high school graduation; to take part in the examination, the higher examination, with grades of 70% and above of the total score (up to 525 points if a total score of 750 points) and include two language and one mathematics or natural science achievement requirements.
In addition, the requirements for performance in higher examinations vary from one profession to another.
For example, applying for specializations in medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., requires a full score of 80% for higher examinations, and the subject of higher examinations must include mathematics, physics, chemistry, at least two in organisms, or participation in higher examinations; applying for a legal profession requires a full score of 80% for higher examinations, and the subject of higher examinations must include foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participation in higher examinations.
According to incomplete statistics, several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and others, have now endorsed China ' s performance in the high examination.
In the United Kingdom, for example, higher schools such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept applications from Chinese students for admission on the basis of a higher examination.
Military "Machine Dogs" will begin with acting classes.
The U.S. military has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and may be on the circus stage now!
The Circus of the Sun has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
A comprehensive foreign media report, the Boston Power Technology Company published a promotional film on 24 April entitled “Spot, a four-foot robot”, which shows Spot as an agile mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility to cross-country terrain, 360-degree avoidance functions, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has exclusive software platforms specifically developed for Spot, and users can customize Spot robotic functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics published the idea of a machine dog for the first time in 1992, when it caused a sensation, but so far it has not really been put into commercial use.
However, according to Boston Dynamics and Technology, Spot is now in the mass production phase, with a majority of buyers predominantly in the construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Sun Circus, which is currently in contact with Boston Power Technology, said that the scheme was still in the conceptual stage and was assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.
The State Council ' s Press Office issued the White Paper " China and the World in a New Era "
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Press Office of the State Council issued a White Paper on " China and the World in a New Era " on 27th.
The Vice-Minister of China and Chief of the Press Office of the State Council, Xu Jian, said that the white paper focused on “Where China comes from and where it goes” and “What a world China is promoting” and “How a developing China can live with the world”, and systematically described China's development achievements, development paths and trends, as well as China's relations with the world, with a view to enhancing the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has undergone dramatic changes that have created a miracle of development unprecedented in human history, especially since the Party ' s eighteenth anniversary, with historic achievements and transformations in China ' s development.
Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper presents the great achievements, significance and world contribution of China ' s development over the past 70 years.
According to the White Paper, over the decades, China had completed the development journey that had taken place in the developed countries for centuries. The economy was the second largest in the world. Nearly 1.4 billion people had emerged from material shortages and had generally reached a level of well-being and enjoyed unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper emphasized that, for 70 years, the Chinese people had come home with nothing, self-reliance and hard work and had made a new reality; for 70 years, China had developed in its interaction with the world, embraced the world, learned the world and contributed to it; and for 70 years, China had contributed to world peace and given impetus to the common development of all nations.
According to the White Paper, the success of China ' s development over the past 70 years is rooted in the fact that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to development, the socialism of the Chinese identity, and are steadfast in their pursuit of that path.
The White Paper emphasized that China ' s unique socialist path was a path based on national circumstances, a path that placed the interests of the people first, a path of reform and innovation, a path to common development in openness, and a path to a State based on the rule of law in all its aspects.
This path of development in China is in line with China ' s national circumstances and will be adapted to the requirements of the times and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In response to the concerns of the international community with regard to China ' s development, the White Paper stresses that achieving the country ' s wealth, national revitalization and the well-being of its people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that full-scale openness to the outside world creates more opportunities for development in all countries, that China provides the international community with more public goods, that China's development provides experience and lessons for other developing countries, and that China will never follow the path of “big power”.
Faced with the question of the age of “What the world is about, what humanity is about”, the White Paper states that the world today is in the midst of a century of great change and that human society is both hopeful and challenging.
China ' s initiative to build a community of human destinies and to open up new avenues for development that cooperate in win-win and shared development offers new options for human development.
The White Paper called on States to unite in building a new form of international relations, to promote a new globalization of the economy, to preserve the international system with the United Nations at its core, to promote exchanges of civilizations, and to contribute together to the creation of a community of human destinies and a better world.
With the growing development of China, the international community is generally concerned about how a developing country can live with the world.
The White Paper states that China cannot develop without the world, and that the world cannot develop and prosper peacefully without China.
China has always placed its own development in the system of coordinates of human development, has insisted on cooperation in the win-win and common development, has insisted on maintaining and promoting economic globalization, has actively developed a global partnership, has firmly supported multilateralism, has upheld international justice, has promoted the building of a “one-way” of high-quality development, has actively participated in leading the reform and construction of the system of global governance, and has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.
At present, China's development has entered a new era.
The White Paper states that China in the new era will not change its determination to follow the path of socialism characterized by China, that it will not change its determination to learn from each other and to work together to win, and that it will not change its determination to work with the world.
The White Paper concluded by stating that the future of nations in today ' s world has never been so closely linked as it is now.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Era " , consisting of forewords, texts and closing words, contains more than 29,000 words.
The White Paper was published in eight languages, namely, C, E, F, R, D, S, A, D, and D, respectively, by the People ' s Press and the Foreign Press, and was distributed at Xinhua Bookshops throughout the country.
Is Marwar in the run-up to the conference in Denver, Joffrey, U.S.A.?
The President of the Ma'al Wa'er, Dato' Seri Wei, said, "To the Supreme Council of the National Front!
The temporary by-election of Danfly to Ai was a cause for concern as to whether Mawar, a member of the National Front party, would take up the traditional national seat.
However, following the meeting of the CCM, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Mawar seat would continue to be taken over by the Mawar or by the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after chairing the meeting of the Madhua Central Committee, Wei said to the media that any by-election would take place in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), i.e., only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1 January) to finalize the By-elections for the Danfumi State Sea, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the NFL was expected to take place in early October.
“Tomorrow yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Dato’s Amalzahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope.”
“We have finalized a meeting of the leaders of the PFDJ in early October, where the leaders of the three parties of the PFDJ will determine which of its members will take up the party.”
Inquiries about whether the Mawar would insist to the Supreme Council of the NFL as a traditional seat, and Mr. Wei's reiteration that, as the head of the Ma'awa General, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures, and therefore any decision must be taken by consensus of the NFL.
“In any by-election, it is common for people to be willing to march, for political parties and for parties to think that they should come out.”
“What organization and political alliance do we come from?”
“This is a great test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values.”
“In this process, someone may say something, which is not surprising.”
“But once the Supreme Council of the NFL has made its decision, we must all be ready to fight, which is the most valuable.”
In any event, Wei Jiaxiang indicated that Ma Wah would make every effort at three levels, namely, district councils, state boards and the centre, to prepare for the forthcoming by-election of the Danfon-Ai seat.
“The district council is led by the chairman of the district council (Danfrey Bie) with the head of the district council with the head of the district council with the head of the governor of the state council with the head of the council with the head of the head of the council with the head of the council with the head of the council with the head of the central board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the administration, with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the department, with the head of the government, with the head of the state, with the head of the state, with the head of the state, with the council, with the head, with the head, with the head of the council, with the head of the council, with the head, with the head, with the head, with the head, with the head, with the head, with the head, with the head of the head of the council, with the head, with the head of the head of the head of the head of the council, with the head of the head of the head of the government.”.”
Last Saturday (21st), Congressman Dato'mohamed Fari of the Aboriginal Solidarity Party took a heart attack, died in a government hospital in stupid Jane, 42 years old.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was ordered to “compulsory patrol the mountains” for hunting wildlife.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of 15420 yuan (RMB).
As a result of the indigence of the families of the accused, the Public Prosecution Service introduced alternative forms of labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, bringing about an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On 27 September, Wang Chong Liang, Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Prefectural District, explained that, through three months of alternative labour, such as “compulsory cruises”, the accused had established deep feelings with wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Paikang filed a civil pro bono lawsuit in the area of ecological resources, which was heard in the district court and handed down in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment, four years ' probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420.
According to the survey, starting in late January 2014, a power grid was installed on the cliffs, hunting for more than 20 wildlife species, including falcons, pelicans, fur crown deer, and so on.
The falcon is a secondary endangered wildlife conservation animal in the country, and the puppies, the fur crown deer, are listed in the National List of Wildlife Conservation on Land.
In the course of the trial, each week confessed to his or her wrongs and conduct and was willing to assume incidental civil liability.
However, in view of the poor economic situation of a certain family in the past week, the local village council, the forest station and the three local parties, in coordination with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural Department of the Preah Vihear, entered into an agreement on the cost of alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration: the provision of public services to cover the cost of ecological restoration through the practice of salivation of monkeys in the village ' s monkey reserve, the compulsory patrol of mountains and the protection of forests for a period of one year.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the Court accepted that the granting of a suspended sentence should be accompanied by the active fulfilment of the obligation of “alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration costs”.
At present, Monday has three months of compulsory work in the Monument Reserve, and the patrol of the mountains has been positive and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Pavcon has integrated in practice the functions of the public prosecutor and the conduct of social governance, with the use of scientific and other forms of supervision, such as prosecutorial advice, investigatory supervision, procedural supervision, and the use of judicial means to minimize the damage caused to the environment by criminal acts.
United Nations award of the Earth's Guardian Award for the Ant Forest
In a warm round of applause and loud music, the head of the Ant Forest project, Xu Ding, and the user representative, Shen Xiao Liang, went to the podium to receive the 2019 United Nations Champion of the Earth award from the moderator.
The Earthguard award ceremony, held in New York, United States of America, in 2019, awarded the Incentive and Action Award for the ants Forest project, a small mobile program that brought hundreds of millions of people into environmental action.
A week earlier, the United Nations Environment Programme had announced a list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the people who had participated in the award ceremony on that day still had little to hide.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inga Anoxen, said that the Ant Forest was an exciting innovation that brought hundreds of millions of people to action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the Ant Financial Services Group of China (the " ant gold suit " ) on a payout platform, where users accumulated "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily green travel in the Ant Forest, online payments for electricity and water, and "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
Each time a user grows a virtual tree, the ant forest and a public good partner plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August of this year, 500 million “ant forest” users have collectively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in areas of desertification.
In the same day's Earthguard award, Costa Rica won an award for national environmental efforts, and Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado, who came to the award, praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, “an impressive effort to inspire so many people to engage in green action.”
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the ant gold garments said that the Earthguard award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms made it possible to engage in low-carbon life, an honour that belonged to all participants.
According to Kenji Ii, the ant forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the ant forest over the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase the income of farmers from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve increased harvests through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The public interest environmental model created by the Ant Forest, based on digital technology, has also been successfully carried out in the sea and has been replicated in other countries.
Last June, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon livelihoods.
It was reported that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization and others, planned to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded once a year.
The Ant Forest was awarded the “Incentive and Action Award” for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction of the Tsaihan Dam Park in China and the “Kill Village Demonstration, Man Village Rehabilitation” project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Trade friction affects the United States economy's “report card”.
The United States “records” of the economy in the second quarter of this year showed a marked slowdown in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States as compared to the previous quarter, as a result of the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 February showed that US GDP grew by 2 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter, the same as the previously published revised data, but significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
The data show that consumer growth is the main factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, dragging up 1.16 percentage points of economic growth in the same season; exports fell 5.7 per cent over the previous quarter; and net exports dragged down 0.68 percentage points of economic growth in the same season.
Barry Knapp, managing partner for the macroeconomic consulting firm in Ainside, United States, stated that private sector investment had not kept pace with last year ' s growth, but had declined significantly, owing to the impact on business confidence of economic friction and rising uncertainty.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, corporate capital spending in the United States is expected to continue to decline in the coming year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty that they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the United States consumption prospects.
The head of the survey, Richard Courting, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, had recently stated that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had referred spontaneously to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new high in a year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally agree that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, the view was also expressed that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic friction were eased.
The global economist, Karin Burch, of the British Economist think tank, predicts that in the future the United States economy will continue its downward trend since this year, with a much lower rate of growth than in the second quarter.
Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandy, predicts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% this year, further slowing to 1.6% next year, assuming that the economic friction will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hazen, the investment manager of Patnam Investment, noted that the greatest concern of the current enterprise was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it created, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced, and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is today.
Matt Melley, the Miller-Tabak Asset Management equity strategist, said that economic friction remained the “first issue” and was the main cause of this year’s significant volatility in US capital markets, and that its proper resolution would be the key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first couple in Ningxia can take 10 days of parental leave per year for children between 0 and 3 years of age.
Guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Session of the Ningxia Autonomous Community.
This is the local regulation on the comprehensive and systematic defence of women ' s legitimate rights and interests, enacted by the first province of Ningxia, which will be in force as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People ' s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and were divided into nine chapters, 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Ordinance, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the Office of the State Council issued guidance on promoting the development of childcare services for infants under the age of 3 years.
In the course of the revision of the Ordinance, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to “encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children in accordance with the law and regulations”.
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative outcome of China ' s current civil code on personality rights, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent incidence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to undertake relevant educational, protective and preventive work as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and dispose of the common property of the matrimonial family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly establishes the right of women to know about the common property and the obligations of the property registry and related entities, and provides a solid institutional support for women ' s rights.
In addition, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest experience of joint interview practice to strengthen penalties for gender-based discrimination violations and to strengthen the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women ' s Federation, the Joint Public Prosecution Division, the Civil Administration, etc., in promoting and introducing the participation of social and professional forces in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in the fight against domestic violence has been very effective.
The Regulations summarize and promote this by encouraging the mobilization of social forces, the pooling of social resources and the defence of women ' s rights and interests, and by requiring the people ' s governments at and above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through, inter alia, the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the UNITA Yuanlong Pyramid workstation is saline-resistant, rice-producing acre.
The journalist was informed by the UNITA Administration Administration of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27 July that the “Saline Rice Field Test and Evaluation Council of the UNITA Yuanlong Pyre Workstation” recently held by the Alliance had uploaded good news that the average acre production of saline rice had broken down by 1,000 kilograms.
A team of six experts from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Rural Department of Hunan Province conducted a sampling of “salt series” rice harvesting on site.
According to expert assessment, the average acre production of saline rice amounted to 508.8 kg on a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, with a salinity content of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
“We intend to build on this year’s experiments and to innovate, as well as reform, so that salt-resistant rice varieties can again be cultivated and optimized, so as to be of better quality and yield.”
The researcher, the Vice-President of the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, who is the head of the Group of Experts on Production Surveys, has come here to say for good: “In the absence of any change in the factors of production, I believe that the continued intensification of the scientific and technological offensive will continue to produce miracles on the saline.”
UNITA is part of a conglomerate of special hardship areas in the Greater Happiness and the South.
In October 2018, the Yuanlong Pilgrim worked for UNITA to unveil its medal.
Master Yuan led a team of experts to speed up the introduction of the newly developed “salin-resistant hybrid rice” varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of salin-resistant rice bases in the right-wing flag of Koryu, use side-test demonstration, and promote technological routes to boost the productivity of the local poor and lift them out of poverty.
This on-site survey of salt-resistant rice not only injected hope into the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and medium-yielding fields to middle- and high-yield fields, but also provided a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in our country.
The new Australian state passed the legalisation of abortion bill on 26 September, local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, as reported by the Australian Network.
According to the information received, the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks, and there have been serious differences within the AFP since the introduction of the bill by the independent member of Parliament, Greenwich.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the legalisation of abortion bill by 26 votes to 14, on the night of 25, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new State Senate.
In the morning, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new Länder, abortion was legalized in the new Länder.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
An amendment was adopted by the Senate on the evening of 25 September, whereby doctors can seek advice from the Multidisciplinary Group of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing an abortion on a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate included the need for doctors to provide appropriate care to infants who survived the termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new state, Beridgeklain, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill and, on several occasions, had intervened to secure more time for debate on the bill, but she had not been present at the final vote.
"I need time to run the whole new state."
It was reported that AFP Member of Parliament Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government, and alleged that the bill triggered a “government crisis”.
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: “The content of the amendment to the bill on the legalization of abortion submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26 provides, in fact, more guarantees for women, doctors.”
At the same time, Bari Laro, the leader of the New Australian National Party, said that he was proud to be a member of the Government that legalized abortion.
“What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a criminal offence, nor does it treat an abortion woman as a criminal.”
Three major groups of projects are located in La Côte d'Ivoire.
A total of 15 billion yuan was invested, focusing on the development of oil-smart equipment and the intelligent steel industry.
Today, the People ' s Government of the city of Changzhou and the Trinity Group are holding a signing ceremony for the project.
The tri-group invested $15 billion in industrial projects such as the intelligent steel industry, oil-smart equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases) and the second-hand car market for engineering machinery in Changzhou, which are expected to produce more than $200 billion annually.
The Trinity Iron and Steel Industry Project, with a total investment of $10 billion, will focus on creating the largest steel and product trading centre throughout the province and in the centre, as well as the Trinity Metal Structures Smart Manufacturing Centre; the Oil Smart Equipment and the Regional Research and Development Centre (HQ) project, with a total investment of $5 billion, will identify the clear ponds, and will focus on building oil intelligence equipment production bases and building regional R&D centres and headquarters bases.
At the same time, the Trinity Group will build a second-hand market for engineering machinery at the Gasbo Park in Changzhou, with practical cooperation in areas such as smart manufacturing.
The city attaches great importance to cooperation with the Triad Group.
The city listed the cooperation project as “Project 1”, a city-wide call for investment this year. The city's secretary, Mao Teng Fei, the mayor of Yang Wei, took the lead, set up a special coordination group, which provided high-quality and efficient services for the development of Trinity's land, from the point of contact to the formal signing of the cooperation agreement, less than 100 days before and after.
Minister of Finance Liu Quin: 67 UFOs and financial institutions have transferred $8.601 billion from the State to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Quin, stated on 27 September that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the State capital enhancement social security fund, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan.
Liu Quin made the above statement at the deployment of the task of the national transfer of part of the capital of the National Fund for Social Security, which was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Council of the Treasury on the same day.
“The transfer of a part of the State-owned capital, the Fund for Social Security, is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, is an adequate reflection of universal access to the results of State-owned enterprise development and the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system, and is a policy measure that is based on the present and takes into account the long-term.”
In 2017, the State Council issued the Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Implementation of the Social Security Fund, which called for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Quan, the transfer of the previous period has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three batches of conversions of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions were completed, totalling approximately 8601 billion yuan in State-owned capital.
Of these, the transfer of the central financial institutions of the Ministry of Finance, which carry out the functions of funders, has been largely completed.
Central business conversions are already on a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot work had almost been completed in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces, transferring State-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces undertook successive pre-transfer preparations, which laid the groundwork for the next transition.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CVM, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF was fully opened in 2019 and almost completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day resulted in a concrete deployment of the full roll-out.
It was emphasized that the transfer should be accomplished pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer is to be substantially completed by 2020.
The transfer time is tight and the task is heavy."
Liu Quin said that the regions and sectors should be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer was completed as required; that the work was carried forward in a solid manner, with an accurate grasp of the content of the transfer policy; and that communication coordination should be strengthened and difficult issues resolved in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the Social Security Fund – starting from the point of departure of the Fund’s money bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, in my view, this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but a "mathematical addition".
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Welfare, the State Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CSR issued a joint Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, setting out a timetable for the transfer of the State capital to the Fund, i.e., the Central and Local Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Fund for Social Security, which was fully opened in 2019.
Once the documents were published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were also put in place very quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business and industry banks, agricultural banks, to the Social Security Fund, with a total transfer value of more than $115 billion.
Under the Act, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, are entitled to the proceeds, dispositions and information assigned to the State shareholdings.
In a public announcement, the WB, the WB stated that this change of interest would not result in a change in the WB's controlling shareholders and the actual controlling persons.
In response, I believe that similar State entrepreneurship transfers are not simple changes in the attribution of equity, but rather “additional calculations” that trigger a range of effects.
The first step of a partial national transfer of funds to social security is a “plus result” that naturally reflects the universal ownership of state-owned enterprises and the shared development outcomes of all.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, in particular, are, for the most part, in important sectors and areas of our economy, with greater and more stable overall profitability.
Among them, the flagship enterprises have been more successful in achieving excellence on an ongoing basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund would be fully rolled out this year.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council ' s Standing Committee, it would work on the full transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, the “plus result”, is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further consolidate the foundations of the social security system for old age.
As a result of the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national resources that have been transferred this time have the capacity to sustain profits and dividends, not only to effectively replenish the Social Security Fund, but also to provide a source of living water for the Social Security Fund.
Measurements show that for every 3.8 percentage points of State capital transferred, the contribution rate of the enterprise's basic pension insurance is reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, the "plus result" , is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The transfer recipient receives the proceeds by "primarily rededicated and operationally supported".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor of State capital, does rely on the gain of equity dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a relatively strong capital working capacity.
For publicly listed assets of State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Fund's rising equity weight, as an investment wind, has helped to further enhance its influence in the market and to act as a “stabilizer” in the market.
In addition, it facilitates the full realization of the “value discovery” function of institutional investors, leading them to invest rationally and in value.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18 and was later taught from Weberburn.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany, and then even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created the Miserae and dedicated it to "My Long Sleeping Friends".
This symphony was inaugurated in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann resolved not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concert was a violin and string concerto, when the manuscript of the concert was stolen from Germany and the premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert of the Berne House Orchestra at Beethoven Music Festival in 2018.
The United States Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labour, Xinhuanet.
On September 26, Xinhua, Washington, D.C., the Senate of the United States Congress voted by President Trump to nominate Eugene Scalia as Minister of Labour.
The result of the vote was 53 votes in favour, 44 against, and none of the Democrats voted in favour of Scalia.
The Republicans believe that Scalia ' s curriculum vitae makes him very suitable for the post of Minister of Labour.
However, in the view of the Democrats, Scalia has long been in opposition to workers and trade unions in the course of his legal career.
Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, resigned in July this year, under great pressure from public opinion, after being accused of “massive treatment” of Jeffrey Eppstein, a billionaire in the United States who is suspected of sexual abuse and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia, a 56-year-old partner in a well-known law firm in the United States, was fathered by Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government, which is responsible for labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Guena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, to head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Géner must also be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, coordinates federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and their follow-up in the United States.
Since the first military parade on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the National Day, each major military parade has seen the emergence of a “big no-man” of a strategic missile force.
“This national day parade was the first time that the rocket-propelled army appeared on the street after the ‘warfare’ turned into a ‘warlord’.”
Wang Bo, the commander of the rocket-equipment unit, said.
The missile-visited forces are fully equipped with a particularly bitter, combatable, dedicated spirit, rigorous training, scientific formation, full-scale military training, three main features, a good image of strategic forces, and a greater focus on hard practice.
During this military parade, both generals and soldiers were subjected to strict standard requirements, creating a culture of aggressive and prohibited excesses.
They also focus on the spirit of the craftsmen, grasping each detail as a skill, as well as perseverance and skill, creating the characteristics of “military postures, quick movement, clear words”, constantly crafting a martial arts missile array, with a greater focus on scientific and technological innovation.
As a high-tech strategic army, the rocket army is a tradition and an advantage of science, technology and innovation.
This military parade, which builds on past experience, breaks the mindset and breaks the traditional approach of using advanced tools such as satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-resolution imaging, real-time speed measurement, to upgrade the level of training and quality efficiency and to ensure that personnel and vehicles are integrated in milligrams, and that the action of the teams is time-sensitive and more responsive to operational standards.
The rocket forces were asked to adhere to the same standards and higher requirements as the military parade and launch sites, to hold every gate, to keep a close eye on every detail, to make the troops subjected to the hammer of fire, and to make the national parade truly a training ground and a test ground to enhance the force ' s combat power.
Iran has been confirmed to be developing advanced centrifuges to suspend further the implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran had once again violated the Iran nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
Iran is reported to be gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its enriched uranium stock below 300 kg and to keep its enriched uranium purer to no more than 3.67%, and now moves further.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran has been able to build only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, in addition to allowing Iran to use a small number of more advanced types of aircraft for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the production of nuclear bombs.
According to reports, the International Atomic Energy Agency report states: “On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of type 2, 3 R & D are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium.”
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency submitted this report to Member States on 26th, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility.”
The Vietnamese Association of Investors and Entrepreneurs is officially visible.
Chen Hae-ling, President of the Viet Nam Investors and Entrepreneurs Association, said that VKBIA would work together as a bridge to strengthen inter-Korean relations.
The two countries aim to increase their trade in both directions to $100 billion by 2020.
Mr. Chen Hae-ling believed that the birth of the Association had been an important step towards that goal.
He hoped that the Viet Nam Party, the Government and relevant Korean functional agencies would assist in the future operation of the Association.
Viet Nam's Deputy Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, Chen Changhui, stated that VKBIA would create a good platform for exchanges and sharing of experiences and ideas between Vietnamese and Korean entrepreneurs, with the aim of expanding the space for investment cooperation, mutual assistance and mutual assistance to make a more effective contribution to Viet Nam's economic development and integration into the international economic cause, and contributing to the dynamic development of trade relations between the two countries.
During the ceremonial ceremony, VKBIA delegates signed cooperation agreements with representatives of the Viet Nam Association of Farming and Agribusinesses.
VKBIA coincided with the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the strategic partnership between the two countries, and was born in the context of the strengthening of practical cooperation between the two countries in the areas of foreign affairs, defence, security and the promotion of trade and investment cooperation aimed at achieving a two-way trade of $100 billion by 2020.
The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
The new Government of Italy, the Minister of Education of the Cabinet and member of the Five Star movement, Lorenzo Fiolamonti, submitted a motion to Parliament recommending a new tax policy for the Italian Government on sugar-rich beverages, snacks and airline tickets.
According to reports, pursuant to a motion for a bill by the Minister of Education, Fiolamonti, the Italian Government will impose a zero-food tax on dietary products that are harmful to health, such as sugary beverages, snacks, etc., as well as a harsh environmental tax on airline tickets, a levy of 1 euro on domestic flights and a levy of 1.5 euros on international classes.
Fiolamonti indicated that, through this seemingly small range of tax measures, the Government expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenues.
Funds from this tax will be used in the areas of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Cont stated that he believed that it was a viable option, and Italian parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, and coalition leader Salvini put it ironicly, asking everyone to hide dessert, biscuits, bread and candy, as the new Government was about to start a snack tax.
It has been reported that the zero-food tax refers generally to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-calored foods.
The levy contributes to the benefits of public health.
On the evening of 25 September, local time, the Chinese Embassy in Canada hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
On the evening of 25 September, the new Chinese Ambassador to Canada (Reporter Yu Rybun) held a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In its message, Tsang Pianwu stated that, in the 70 years since the establishment of the new China, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the concerted efforts of the Chinese people, China ' s special socialist cause has achieved remarkable achievements in the world, which not only profoundly changed the face of China, benefiting its own people, but also brought about far-reaching world significance.
In keeping with its own national circumstances, China had opened a path of socialism characterized by China, expanded the path of modernization for developing countries and contributed its wisdom and Chinese programmes to solving human problems.
A photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the New China, co-located with guests, was presented.
As Tsong has stated, China has created rare miracles in the history of human development in the world and made an important contribution to the promotion of world peace and development.
China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace, has always advocated the basic norms of international relations, with the five principles of peaceful coexistence at its core, and is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.
China ' s development offered new opportunities for development in all countries of the world, including Canada, and benefited all peoples.
The series emphasizes that the course of almost 50 years of development of the China-China relationship shows that it is only with the principles of equality and mutual respect that relations between the two countries can move forward on the right track.
Conversely, relations between the two countries would be frustrated and the interests of the two countries undermined.
At the present time, China faces serious difficulties in its relations, and it is not the responsibility of China.
"Ringer also has to be the bell man."
It is hoped that the parties will soon come up with an appropriate solution to the problems highlighted in their bilateral relations in order to create the conditions for the return to normal relations between the two countries.
The reception was attended by more than 700 Canadian government officials, federal senators, a wide range of friendly personalities, the Ambassador to Côte d ' Ivoire and representatives of Chinese non-Chinese, Chinese institutions and students.
Diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, such as Chen Myung Jian and the Congcai Xiao Xiao Army, attended the reception.
The reception featured a photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China, as well as promotional videos, such as China 2019 and Beautiful China.
Central and Chinese artists and embassy diplomats performed special literary programmes.
This is also the first time that the 16th Ambassador of China to Canada, Tsun, has taken the lead in a public event.
The series arrived on 22 September and presented copies of the letters of State the following day in Ottawa to the Chief Protocol Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chief Protocol Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wheeler.

On behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the ASEAN mission, Shojian said that the birth of the new China in 1949 had ushered in a new era in China ' s history.
China has moved from closed backwardness to open progress, from lack of food and clothing to comprehensive prosperity, from a weak and weak population to a prosperous and prosperous nation, and the Chinese nation has come a historic leap from standing up, being rich to being strong.
Shoji said that, in recent years, China-Indonesia's relations had grown considerably, political mutual trust between the two countries had grown, practical cooperation had continued, exchanges in various fields had expanded and the full-fledged strategic partnership between the two countries had expanded.
China-ASEAN relations have continued to escalate, and have always adhered to mutual respect, understanding, trust and support in order to contribute significantly to the peaceful, stable and prosperous development of the region.
According to Shaw, the fundamental aspect of the development of the new China over the past 70 years is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have created and developed the socialist path of Chinese identity.
This path, adapted to the times and in line with China ' s national circumstances, profoundly alters the destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and also contributes significantly to the peaceful development of the world and the region, is the path of a strong country that can walk well, well and well.

The reception also featured a “Course on the theme of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China”, which attracted guests to watch.
A hundred degrees of the first autopilot taxi team to start a trial operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees announced in Changsha that the pilot operation of Robotaxi, an automated taxi team, was officially opened.
The first 45 “Red Flag EV” Robotaxi convoys, developed jointly by Apollo and a red flag, became operational on a trial basis in the open test section of the Changsha sector.
As of this date, ordinary Changsha citizens can access the Apollo official network and apply to become seed users and have an opportunity to experiment with the experience.
One experienced passenger indicated that he was in the back of the vehicle, clicking on the passenger's front screen, and the first key opened the autopilot of the vehicle.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and as required by current policy and regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver ' s seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the surrounding vehicle and make automatic concessions, such as in the case of near-distance overcarriage.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screens show in real time the road conditions of pedestrians, cars and even some of the traditional blind areas on the road.
Even when vehicles are blocked, information such as changes in the front red and green lights and waiting times can be seen in advance, with all traffic conditions becoming apparent.
Unmanned people have heard of it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but today it's amazing to find it in our lives.
We expect it to truly enter the lives of the people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 manned test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot tests open roads, passing through the city's artificial smart technology city, May Creek Lake, Ocean Lake, Wangshan, High New Zone, etc., amounting to 135 km, with a demonstration area of 70 square kilometres, is the longest, largest and most complex of the country's roads, the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area with a coordinated road infrastructure.
By the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy is expected to cover approximately 50 kilometres of the pilot operational road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 kilometres of the road currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
The women's platoon still has a grudge against Ping: it's hard to beat a strong team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of Beijing time 27, the Chinese women ' s club celebrated the ninth round of the 2019 women ' s World Cup against the strong Dutch women ' s team, which culminated in the victory of the Chinese women ' s platoon 3:1 over the Dutch women ' s team and the nine-time victory of the women ' s World Cup.
However, after the race, the female platoon leader, Ping Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third round.
“The third round has increased the aggressiveness of the ball, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes.”
"Fighting with the strong, making so many mistakes, it's hard."
In an interview after Rampingsai, he said:
“We told the team to focus, and when the legend is not in place, we're going to take the reposition, and we're going to fight each other.”
Ruan-Ping also commented on Chang-nin's performance, saying that she had some difficulties in the attack, was anxious, too eager to kill the ball, and that the movement would be distorted.
Let's hope she's patient, "Let's protect her."
China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
White Paper (New China 70 years): China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
According to the White Paper, with the rapid rise in China's combined national power and international influence, there are international fears that China will follow the path of “the powerful and the powerful” and some raise the so-called “China threat doctrine”.
This has ranged from cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, and the psychological imbalance brought about by the erosion of power, to deliberate distortions in defence of their vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of the people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.”
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that China is the largest contributor to economic growth in the world, that technological innovation in China injects new energy into economic growth in the world, and that the role of stabilizers and engines in the future of the Chinese economy is even more prominent.
At a time when the world economy is not sufficiently dynamic for economic growth, a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, with new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, modernization of agriculture accelerating, deep structural adjustment of the economy, sustained upgrading of industrial excellence, and the emergence of new economic growth.
“A study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that, by 2040, China’s integration with the rest of the world’s economies is expected to generate an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15–26% of the global economy, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create huge economic value.”
The White Paper emphasized that the Chinese economy and the world economy had undergone structural changes and were deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Treating China's economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge” and trying to “decord” China from global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains, and the world economy is not feasible and harmful.
The White Paper noted that full-scale external openness created more opportunities for countries to share the “China dividend”.
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, with greater and higher levels of external openness. China has the world's most potential consumer markets. China is the most attractive destination for investment.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
A mutually beneficial two-way approach can last for the long term.”
The White Paper stated that China was committed to the sustained expansion of imports, the liberalization of market access, the improvement of the business environment and the strengthening of intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
It is only by working together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created, and the “cake” of development becomes larger and a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests can emerge.
According to the White Paper, China provides the international community with more public goods.
This includes the promotion of a high-quality "one-way", the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
“China has benefited from the international community's development, and has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations in order to provide the international community with more and better public goods.”
The General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slepniov, in a recent written interview with a Xinhua journalist, expressed Russia ' s willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slepniov noted that while the forestry, mechanical and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russia ' s exports to China, the export of agricultural products is also important, including oil, meat and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material, non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development.
Referring to the optimization of the Russian export structure to China, Slepniov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand the export of high-technology products to meet the import demand for high-technology products from all countries and regions of the world, including China.
The Russian side will then improve financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-technology enterprises.
The Russian Federation has expressed its readiness to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in the fields of medicine, aviation manufacturing, etc.
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the area of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia's products in many areas were “quality superior and price competitive” over similar products in the West.
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to contribute to the diversification of supply in these areas and to the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to facilitate the entry of its exporters into the global value-added chain, with China as one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, there is a need for both countries to continue to deepen business cooperation, “to establish more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and to develop exports to third countries”.
Slepniov indicated that the Russian Export Centre, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, was undertaking a variety of measures and services to support the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with the relevant sectors of the Chinese side in order to promote easier access for Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of exports to China.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the so-called "diplomatic breakthrough":
In response to Taiwan's recent entry to United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference, saying that the small move was ignominious and laughterful.
A question was posed by journalists, who, according to the Taiwanese media, had recently entered United Nations Headquarters for a meeting on religious issues in the United States and called it a “diplomatic breakthrough”.
The meeting to which you referred was a United States side event on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.
To say the truth, the people of the Taiwan staged a sneaky, self-defeating, self-proclaimed so-called “diplomatic breakthrough”, which was a disgraceful, grinning gesture.
He noted that the United Nations, for its part, had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the issue of Taiwan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the general membership of the United Nations was committed to the one-China principle.

The story bank brings together five broad thematic stories of “1+4”.
Xi Jinping's secretary-general is the “China's first story,” and the “Learning” section is based on Xi's story, Xi's story, the story of Xi's Xi's Xi's Xi's Xi's Xi's Xi's Qi's Qi's Qi's Qi's Qi's story, and the story of Xi's acclaimed character.

The authorities have demonstrated a strong crackdown on the president's fall from Mount Egypt.
Twitter feature tags and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since the military coup of Cessi, then the head of the military, seized power in 2013, the expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has become extremely dangerous.
The British newspaper Guardian reported that the Cairo-based non-governmental organization, the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for the resignation of Ceci.
The corruption allegations surrounding Ceci and his family's wasteful pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets in 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country will be met with determination and will not be soft.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen were seen on the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al-Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social sages on 25 days, including Nafa, a professor of political science and a well-known columnist at Cairo University.
“I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cessi will cause disaster”, he wrote in his tweet on 24th.
"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately."
Prior to Nafa ' s arrest, Hosni, former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian military, was detained as spokesperson for Annan.
Anna was arrested last year after an attempt to win the presidency with Ceci.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is exacerbated, the campaign against dissent reflects the instability and fragility of the Government.
The opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who fought for the presidency, said: “The arrest underscores the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people, and its own fear.”
“Cessi tried to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who might replace him, because the economy had been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political repression.”
Noor noted that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government ' s high-handed approach would only increase the population ' s anger.
Since the barrier of fear had been broken, he expected more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, was a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military and began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to have benefited from the corruption of the Government, which triggered a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali stated that his company, Amrak, was not required to go through the required bidding process to obtain lucrative contracts, emphasizing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply sorry that he had been involved in it.
Ali claims that his assistance to the Fulfilled Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessigue stands in stark contrast to the abject poverty currently being experienced by Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, such thematic labels as "Stand Up and You Are Not Alone", "Sessi You Are Dead", "Sexy Rolling" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets in a peaceful manner to demand Seth to step down.
Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian male star, has almost 7 million followers on Twitter.
He posted a tweet yesterday in Arabic saying, “Cessi is doomed...he is doomed, and those who support him are now making a big mistake.”
Hong Kong's special free training program to help recently economically affected employees get through.
On 27th, the HKSAR Government announced the introduction of a free special training programme for employees affected by recent economic conditions, with a maximum of HK$4,000 per month for eligible trainees upon completion of the course.
Many fine shops in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha'ay seaport have very few customers.
As a result of recent social strife in Hong Kong, there has been a significant decline in the number of visitors to Hong Kong, with the exception of the tourism industry, which has affected the hotel, catering, retail, etc.
The Director General of the Labour and Welfare Department of the HKSAR Government, Mr. Qiu Tenghua, Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Economic Development, commissioned the Employees Retraining Bureau to carry out a special training programme, as well as measures to support the tourism industry, to meet with the media.
Lo Chi Quang described the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy as imminent and should not wait until the situation calmed down.
Therefore, the HKSAR Government introduced this free training program, “Special? Love Added”.
It was reported that persons who had been unemployed or who had been asked by their employers to take unpaid leave since 1 June had the opportunity to participate in the scheme, provided that the relevant requirements had been met.
The curriculum is extensive, with the most important part being “vocational skills” training, covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as a number of brand new “innovation technology” courses and cross-industry “general skills” courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Bureau, Yu Peng Chun, stated that tuition fees were completely free for all courses and that the plan was expected to support some 10,000 people in need.
A special allowance of HK$4,000 per participant per month is payable to participants who complete each full-time or part-time course and attend an 80 per cent attendance rate.
It was stated that the training course, which lasted two to three months, was provided by some 50 training institutions and was accessible to the public between 3 October and 31 March next year, with up to four courses per person.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has announced a series of measures in support of the tourism industry to assist the industry to overcome its difficulties.
These measures include the easing of allocations to the tourism parliament, the financing of 6,000 additional guided tours and the exemption of travel agents from annual fees, among others.
I'm tired of the exercise, and I'm tired of the brain, too?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed signs of fatigue in the brain as a result of high-intensity motion.
This study, led by Mathias Pesigrion, an expert from the Pitié-Salpetril Hospital in France, shows that there is a invisible link between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Pesigrion explains that: "You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscle and joint pains occur."
The study was launched by the French National Institute for Physical Education and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist is responsible for guiding athletes in their preparations for the Olympic Games.
A number of athletes have begun to develop overtraining syndromes, i.e. an insufferable sense of fatigue, physical inability to recover and a decline in performance following high-burden movements.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to neurological fatigue, the kind of neurological fatigue caused by excessive brain labour?
The study was published in the magazine Contemporary Biology.

On September 27th, World Tourism Day, the theme of the year was “Tourism and work: building a better future for all”, and the Tourist Board organized a series of events, including the reception of lucky passengers and traditional tray competitions, which were celebrated with residents and passengers.
Also on the same day, a special “World Tourism Day” celebration dinner was held to promote exchanges with the tourism industry, with the participation of the Director of the Department of Social and Cultural Affairs, Tan Joon-young, among others, to mark this global tourism event and to contribute actively to the sustainable development of the tourism industry in Macao.

Each contestant passes through the streets of “Macao Historic City” with a tray carrying a bottle of “Macao Beer” in his hand, bringing the beer safely to the front of the terminal as quickly as possible. The process is intense, attracting a large number of passengers to take photographs and even breathe for the contestants along the way, and displaying the tourist charm of Macau.
The male champions were won by Warren Obejas Cabada, in the heart of the city of Jinsa, Macao; the female champions were Ye Xiaojun of the Vision Group; and the most special costume winners were Eugène and Choi Ji-hoon of the Golden Dragon Hotel of the Vision Group, respectively.

At the same dinner, under the theme “Commonizing the 20th Anniversary of the MSAR”, Macao singers were scheduled to sing the original local song of return, “Little of the Lotus”, as well as a number of performances by six large tourist enterprises on the theme of return, showing the diversity of the tourism and leisure elements of Macao and the multi-skilled nature of tourism practitioners.

"Go Out" for Chinese citizens - visit Choi Ai-min, Director of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25 November, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the line of the short film on consular protection of public goods, ended with a statement resonance from a wide network of friends.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Director-General of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Choi Ai-min, said that the short film was intended to further make the public feel the love and the warmth of “diplomatics for the people” and to make Chinese citizens feel that, no matter where they are in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats will extend their help, help, strength and hope to them.
There's nothing wrong with being out of the country. There's nothing wrong with it.
According to Choi E-min, over the past 70 years, the number of “exits” by Chinese citizens has increased dramatically, from “less than a million a year” before reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens travelling abroad is more secure, and consular protection and assistance efforts have been extended from overseas Chinese to various groups such as Chinese diasporas, tourists, students and workers.
According to statistics, since the Party ' s eighteenth year, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, resulting in the safe evacuation of more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Some 500,000 cases of various kinds of help have been received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream to have a "go and go" trip.
According to Choi E-min, by the end of August this year, China had concluded visa-free mutual agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, including Thailand, Egypt and others, have unilaterally granted entry visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while another 15, such as Indonesia, have unilaterally granted exemption to Chinese citizens with regular passports.
In addition to arrangements such as waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier and easier to apply for visas.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These included reciprocal visas with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina for tourism, 10 years of valid multiple visas for business personnel, and two years of multiple visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for tourism, commerce, family visits, etc.
The United Kingdom, Belgium and the United Kingdom jointly launched a “visa one stop” service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who frequently leave the country, the APEC business travel card, which is easily accessible, is a good option.
According to Choi Aimin, holding the travel card amounted to obtaining multiple visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and was significant for business people, especially private business personnel, to “go out”.
At present, China ' s effective holding of cards is among the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures by more countries for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic efforts more into welfare initiatives for all, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

Journalists have been informed by the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province that, to date, 1334 passenger transport lines have been “longlined” in 11 municipalities and 6 prefectures.
The head of the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province described the serious security situation for road passengers as a result of the formality of the security management of some of the passenger carriers, the failure of business security agents to take responsibility, the excessive speed of passenger vehicles, the tired driving of drivers, and other violations of the law.
In order to further consolidate the responsibility of road passenger companies for the safe production of goods and to ensure the safety of passengers travelling by car, the pilot “Long Line” was started in 2017 in Jiangxi and gradually expanded throughout the province in 2018.
At present, 92 road passenger carriers in Jiangxi have implemented a “long line” and selected 1334 line managers, covering 4824 mobile buses.
It was reported that the “head of the line” was typically staffed by personnel designated by road transport passenger carriers, who were specifically responsible for managing the relevant line lines, vehicles, lines, etc., ensuring that the head of the line took full control of the line, the vehicle, the driver, the operating environment, etc., and ensuring the safe operation of the line.

Fujian provincial tax bank, the Silver Integrity Tax Paying Platform, is officially online - the China-New Network
The Fujian provincial tax bank, the consolidated tax collection and payment platform, is officially online.
On 27 September, in Fujian, Fujian Province, a tax collection and payment platform for the Fujian provincial tax bank was officially launched in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, on the Internet on the 27th of September.
The journalist was informed that on 26 October 2018, the central branch of Fukuzhou, the People ' s Bank of China, jointly signed a tripartite memorandum of cooperation between the State Tax Administration of Fujian Province and the China Silver Union, Inc., to launch a national platform to collect taxes and taxes for the benefit of the provincial tax banks.
After almost a year of construction, the platform is now on-line successfully.
The Director of the National Treasury, Central Bank of Fuzhou, China, Wang De Hye, introduced the platform, which is based on the concept of security, universality, convenience, compliance and leadership. The platform is connected to tax, government, banking, non-bank paying agencies and social service providers at the front end and provides a wide range of tax collection channels on the line, such as mobile phone APP, micro-credit public, tax halls, banking points, inclusive financial services points, and the back end to the treasury and tax system.
According to the information received, the platform brings together a number of projects for the benefit of the population, of which the project for the collection of medical fees for urban and rural residents has been officially launched.
The project, which provides services to more than 30 million urban and rural residents in Fujian province, has reached 14 online and offline channels, covering 76 per cent of the permanent resident population of Fujian province.
Health insurance payments can be made online through the “Closing Tax Lines” and the “Cunt Flash” of banks, such as the APP, the Micro-Credit Public, etc., and can be paid under the line to tax halls and rural inclusive financial services points in Fujian province in a variety of ways, such as scavenging, volatilization, and swiping of cards.
The Vice-President of the Fuzhou Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Shidong, said that the platform ' s success was on the line and that, while guaranteeing the direct transfer of government revenues to the bank and the real-time exchange of data and information, it could provide a safe, efficient, multi-channel and multi-modal tax collection service to the public in general.
At present, more than 16,000 inclusive financial services sites across the province have opened up a health-care fee collection function of more than 9,000, making it possible for rural residents to make sure that they pay their health-care contributions without being able to reach their villages, and giving the public an increasingly strong sense of “access”, “happiness” and “happiness”.
According to statistics, in the 20 days since the pre-test operation of the Platform ' s project on the collection of health-care premiums by urban and rural residents, the number of service users has reached 840,000, of which 750,000 are on-line and nearly 20,000 are on-line.
In addition, the Deputy Director-General of the Fujian Department of Revenue of the State Tax Administration revealed at the event that the platform had pioneered the application of the block chain electronic payment certificate technology throughout the country.
Starting next month, the contributor may also download the stamped electronic certificate of contribution directly through the mobile phone after completion of the contribution.
The Fujian tax information network, based on block chain technology, is being built, and the “high-speed road” for the collection of tax fees by the people will be further expanded.
The United States will deploy additional air defence systems and troops in Saudi Arabia.
The United States Department of Defense announced on 26 November that, as a result of the previous attack on Saudi oil facilities, the United States would deploy an additional “patriotic” air defence system, four “Sentry” radar systems and some 200 United States troops in Saudi Arabia.
In a statement on the same day, the Pentagon stated that the deployment would upgrade the anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities of key military objectives and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and enhance the United States military presence in the area.
The statement also stated that United States Secretary of Defense Esper had simultaneously approved the inclusion of two “patriotic” air defence systems and a “Sad” ABM system in the preparation deployment sequence.
Some United States defence media questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, arguing that the main targets of the “patriotic” and “Sad” systems for interception were not low-altitude targets such as drones and cruise missiles that the United States claimed attacked Saudi Arabia.
In his address to the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran could help to maintain “safe Persian Gulf” and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil transport vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, with the fair enjoyment of rights by all States.
At the same time, he stressed that regional security could be achieved only if United States forces withdrew from the area.
On 14 this month, several drones attacked two Saudi National Oil Company oil installations and set fire to them.
The United States accuses Iran of the attack and of imposing new sanctions on Iran.
The Chairman of the Celius Growth Project completed last year’s call to increase the staff by up to 43 per cent.
On the evening of 25 September, Cyrus (603716.SH) announced that the company ' s de facto controller and chairman, Wein Wei, had taken up a total of 10,542,000 shares, or 0.5139 per cent of the company ' s total stock, through the Shanghai Stock Exchange ' s pool bid, with an additional sum of RMB 2009.26 million (including stamp duties, commissions, interest, etc.) to complete the plan.
Prior to the implementation of the scheme, Wenwei had a direct holdings of 8.18 per cent of the company's total equity of 8.5 million shares, accounting for 4.18 per cent of the company's total stock, and Tianjin City, Sumi Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Tianjin Sumi”) held 82,183,500 shares of the company, accounting for 40.06 per cent of the company's total stock, and Wen Wei held 66.06 per cent of the company's real control.
It is a matter of concern that this is not the first time that Célis has made a good sacrifice.
Since last September, in a short period of one year, Cyrus has successively introduced measures such as high-level executive growth, head of board-led growth initiatives, repurchase of shares, equity incentives, and so on.
On 18 September last year, Cyrus announced that the seven planned top executives of the company, Liu Wenhouse, had accumulated an increase of 394.3 million shares (0.1922 per cent of the company ' s total equity), totalling $7,02.29 million, and that the implementation of the plan had been completed.
Shortly thereafter, the Chairman of Cyrus and the realist, Wenwei, initiated an initiative to raise the stock of the company and promised to be compensated for the loss by Wen Wei.
The increase covers the period from 19 October to 31 October 2018, with a total ceiling of 150 million yuan for the addition of the company ' s stock, which is subject to continuous holding of the company ' s stock for a period of more than 12 months, with no reduction, and with compensation when the employee is in service.
The journalist comb found that the minimum share price for the above-mentioned initiative staff was $14.02, up to $16.44, and the maximum floating surplus for the staff was 42.80 per cent, up to 21.78 per cent, at the price of $20.02, collected by Cyrus on 25 September.
On 21 January this year, Cyrus again adopted the Repurchase Company Equity Program, which announced that the total amount of funds to be used for repurchase of shares was not less than 160 million yuan yuan and not more than 280 million yuan yuan.
On 8 August of this year, the company issued a draft of the Cyprus Restricted Stock Incentives Plan 2019 and set high performance unlocking conditions.
According to the bulletin, equity incentives were based on operating income in 2018, with growth rates of not less than 30 per cent, 70 per cent, 120 per cent and 185 per cent for the four fiscal years 2019-2022, respectively.
In terms of Celius ' performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the 30 per cent performance growth unlocked this year.
In the first half of the year, operating income was 842 million yuan, an increase of 46.50 per cent in the same year; the net profit attributable to shareholders in listed companies was 56,23.24 million yuan, an increase of 16.46 per cent in the same year.
And since mid-2018, Céles has grown by more than 38% in five consecutive reporting periods, up to a maximum of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a two-nuclear-driven and coordinated development strategy based on the intensive operation of medical tests (IVD operations) and the breakthrough of the intensive operation of medical consumables (SPD operations) with the regional testing centres to upgrade and advance SPD operations, building on the consolidation of the advantages of the former IVD operations.
Céles-related sources told journalists that the three main operations of Célis are moving steadily towards rapid expansion in response to the general trend of medical reform.
In the SPD field of operations, in January this year, Cyrus announced the signing of a cooperation agreement with the People ' s Hospital of the City of Lingwu and the Central Hospital of the City of Lingwu on the construction and day-to-day operation of an intensive operating platform for medical consumption, for a period of three years.
“In fact, Cyrus is expanding its SPD operations to provide health-care institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution and settlement of medical waste yards for long-term income.”
According to the above-mentioned persons.
On 17 September, on the basis of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network ' s Zhejiang Government Procurement Services Information Platform (ZGAP) bulletin, Célis was awarded the “Provision of Logistics Extension Services in the Institute of Medical Waste (Incl. Reagents)” of the Zhejiang University Medical School, a subsidiary of Zhejiang University.
According to the medical industry analysts, this winning target is very gold-bearing, and the Xiaowu Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the International Hospital Review (JCI). The successful implementation of the project in the future is also an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, the operational map largely completed the operational area coverage of the country ' s provincial areas through regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and mergers and acquisitions through channels.
Today, in Zhejiang's next city, the winning bid hospital should continue to replicate the model in different hospitals and enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year, Célis has also laid out new and emerging areas such as industrial cannabis, block chain technology and others.
In Beijing, 78,000 volunteers travelled for the National Day.
In order to guarantee the smooth running of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, more than 78,000 traffic civilization volunteers from Beijing will be officially placed on duty on the 28th and will volunteer at various points in Beijing for the duration of their service until 8 October.
Prior to that, the Beijing City leadership group for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China had set up a special volunteer command and, in the preceding period, had recruited and trained more than 160,000 highly qualified volunteers for higher education institutions, communities, businesses and all sectors of society, in areas such as the celebration of congresses, festivities, exhibitions of great achievements, national holiday parks and urban operations and security.
Of these, more than 78,000 volunteers from transportation civilizations.
High-level guests: From 28 September to 8 October, 78,266 traffic civilized volunteers from the capital city conducted traffic facilitation and traffic guidance at 1700 traffic points and 308 metro stations in Beijing, including more than 300 major traffic hubs.
Two months after being held by Iran, the British oil tanker “Stanner Empire” was finally released and departed from the Iranian port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time, 27 a.m., the British tanker “Stanner Empire” departed from the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Port and Shipping Organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the vessel had made a formal and written commitment and that, despite the seizure of the vessel, they had no claim.
The Swedish owner of the “Stanner Empire” tanker, Stena Bulk, also indicated that it was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, vessel tracking data from Refinitiv found that the tanker had begun to move and left Abbas port in 27 days.
The British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company ' s spokesperson said that the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, Steena Impero, on the Strait of Hormuz.
The vessel was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian Government stated that all the legal procedures required for the release of the “Stanner Empire” had been completed.
However, the Iranian side indicated that the investigation was still ongoing.
Several Iranian media outlets also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranian tanker, Grace I, was seized from the waters of Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the “Grace I” tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on the suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of “Grace I”.
This afternoon, a thematic conference on the theme of the educational review and restructuring of undergraduate universities across the province was held in Changsha.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to improve the political presence, strengthen political commitment, review the situation from a critical point of view, and promote high-quality development in the construction, political thinking and reform of the institutions of higher education.
Ulan is fully cognizant of the initial results of the second series of thematic education by undergraduate and higher schools.
She noted that education on the theme “Don't forget your mind, don't remember your mission” was a major deployment of the Party's centrality, and that undergraduate schools were required to follow up on the key messages of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission”.
From the promotion of the "four consciousnesss" to the "two preservations", to the political height of the original mission, to the careful implementation of the provisions of the thematic education, and especially to the set of issues that have emerged, to the integration of the reform and development of schools, to the achievement of the "two promotions " .
Uran stressed the need to keep the blade in the ground, to keep the problem under review, to look into the “four cross-checks” and “four search-and-see” requirements, to open the door to suggestions from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, to examine the root causes in a serious and intellectual and profound way, and to identify the direction and improvement of the efforts, and to come up with the hard and practical means to solve the problems.
The word “change” should be applied in practice by maintaining precision, strengthening real change.
It is important to combine thematic education with the work of the “Leeds” and so forth, to press for a change of responsibilities, to ensure that the problem remains intact, to the point where it becomes more effective.
It is important to maintain both the symptoms and the management of the system, improve the long-term mechanisms, weave the cages of the system, strengthen the rigidity of the system, ensure that the work is rule-based, rule-based and genuinely managed by the institution.
In keeping with the above, the leading cadres take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, taking a serious look at the reform, taking the lead at times and playing the role of “critical minority” as a model, in an effort to accomplish the tasks of thematic education and reform.
Comrades from five high school party committees, including Hunan University, made statements.
Two major high-pressure projects, one hand and the other.
On 26 June, the direct transmission of electricity from the east to the south of the country, 1100 kV, and the Soto-Tun 1,000 kV exchange, high pressure of the GIL complex were delivered.
Both of these projects, which account for the current highs of the world ' s electricity transmission technologies in their respective fields, will lead to a significant increase in the country ' s energy-wide optimization configuration.
The General Economist of the National Energy Agency, Guo Ji, stated that the pro-East to Sannan project was the transmission project with the largest power delivery capacity and the most distant transmission in the world.
Their delivery is important for promoting the development of the Xinjiang energy base and securing the electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, a closed transmission line for gas-insulated metals.
The Sutong pipeline project, which created a record of the highest global voltage and transmission capacity of the GIL project, achieved the combined operation of the `interchange double-ring' of the highest voltage level of the backbone power grid in China.
According to the National Electricity Network Corporation, the distance of power transmission from the pro-East to Xuannan project is 3324 kilometres.
When conventional technologies are used, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed through closures, raising the economic transport distance significantly to more than 3,000 kilometres.
The delivery of the near-East to Xinnan project can deliver 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours, 20 minutes, which can help to disrupt the depletion of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, the annual transmission of electricity from this line alone will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), which will cover more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Colony Project is the control work of the ultra-high pressure communication ring network across the Yangtze.
The use of conventional empty lines to cross the river requires the installation of two giant towers of over 450 metres above the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of over four football fields for each of the towers.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative, with the development of a compact super-voltage exchange of GIL transmission technology, which passed through the river through tunnels, avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
The two works contributed to a new leap in the capacity of our electrician equipment.
At present, the national grid has built cumulatively a “10-to-11” super-high-pressure project, with a “4-to-3” in progress.
Foreign Exchange Office: our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced
“In general, the external debt structure of the country continues to be optimized, and external debt stability has increased.”
The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27 September that the main indicators of our external debt were within the internationally recognized security line and that external debt risk was generally manageable.
Wang Chun Ying made this statement in response to a question from the press, when the Foreign Exchange Bureau published external debt data for the end of June 2019.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance at full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, compared to the end of March 2019, mainly as a result of the growth in the debt portfolio balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt growth was driven by the purchase of domestic renminbi bonds by non-residents, mainly from medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points in comparison with the end of March 2019, while the share of foreign debt in this currency rose by 1 percentage point in comparison with the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that, with the incorporation of renminbi bonds into the Bloombergaclé Global Aggregate Index in April 2019 in our country, the recognition of the Chinese bond market by international investors has further increased, with continued increases in the domestic renminbi bonds.
“Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable.”
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27 September that the Yunnan meadows are now effectively protected from widespread outbreaks of disasters and have achieved phased results.
In January of this year, the city of Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Pu, discovered for the first time that night moths had been moved from abroad and subsequently confirmed their occurrence in 129 counties in Yunnan, as well as the gradual spread of night moths from Yunnan to the interior of China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths, an important agricultural pest of multi-food long-range migration originating in the tropics and subtropical regions of the Americas, are a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) global warning, characterized by “international, flight-like, flashy, destructive”.
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, including maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and takes large quantities of food, resulting in up to 70 per cent loss of production.
Control is difficult and there are no registered pesticides in China to control the disease.
Since the migration of the meadows into Yunnan, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eidung Fellows to lead the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on cross-border harmful organisms, in collaboration with the Green Prevention and Control Province innovation team, to the first line, field research, take samples, and conduct a demonstration of technical guidance and experiments.
The Aidong team has acquired initial knowledge of the stock characteristics of the night moths in the Yunnan meadows, the resources of the natural trichlorfon, the characteristics of the source of the off-shore insects, the migration trajectory of the stocks, the toxic effects of the agents and the effects of the field control.
They are actively engaged in research and application of green control technologies, and through the implementation of new green control technologies, such as stock monitoring, insecticide, scientific medicines and agronomy measures, have achieved more than 90 per cent of the control effect in demonstration areas, reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for the effective control of the outbreak of night moths and sustainable governance in Yunnan.
At present, night moths from the Yunnan meadows are effectively controlled, with no large-scale eruptions and phased results.
As a next step, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on ecological mechanisms for the invasion of populations, breaking through the biocontrol and green control technology systems.
At the same time, cross-border international cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities for night moths in Yunnan.
According to the website of the People ' s Bank of China, on 30 September 2019, the People ' s Bank of China is scheduled to issue the Chinese International Import Expo panda plus the silver and gold coin.
The silver and gold memorized currency consists of two pieces, of which one is gold and one is silver, the legal currency of the People ' s Republic of China.
It was reported that the positive picture of the silver and gold medals was a pavilion of the Beijing Temple of Heaven and that the names of the countries, the year number and the Chinese words “China International Import Fair” were published.
The image of the back of the 8-gram circle gold memorized coin is a mother and panda and is published with the words “8g Au.999” and “China's International Import Fair” in English, as well as its face.
A picture of the back of the 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is given by the mother and panda, with the words “30g Ag.999” and “China International Import Fair” in English and the face.
The 8-gram circle gold memorized coin is described as a universal currency, containing 8-gram pure gold, 22-mm diameter, 100-dollar face, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 10,000.
The 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is a universal currency, containing 30-gram silver, 40-mm diameter, 10-pound, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 20,000.
The silver and gold memorized coins were forged by Shenyang Co. Ltd. and sold by China Gold General.
White Paper: China moving out of a country-specific development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing launched the White Paper " China and the World in a New Era " by the Press Office of the State Council of China.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and move forward, successfully opening the path of socialism of the Chinese identity and achieving world-renowned development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China ' s development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the solid spirit of “800 million shirts for a Boeing” — the constant and continuous struggle of generations and the unimaginable hard work and sweat of others — the sense of “one's own responsibility” — the failure to export problems, the absence of contradictions, the forced sale and plundering of other countries, and the search for a way out of “rocks through the river” — instead of following the old path of imperialism, colonialism and the development of Western countries, but in combination with China's reality, drawing lessons, drawing on human civilization, and trying to get out of one's own path.
The White Paper stated that China had developed in its interaction with the world, that China ' s development had injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads were in line with China ' s national circumstances and with the requirements of the times.
China maintains world peace through practical action.
For 70 years, China had not initiated any war or conflict and had not appropriated an inch of the land of another country.
The White Paper stated that over the past 70 years, China ' s development had been a great success, and that the fundamental reason was to find the right path to development, the socialism of China ' s identity, and to follow that path with determination.
It is a path that is based on national circumstances, that puts the interests of the people first, that is, reform and innovation, that seeks common development in openness, and that is fully governed by the rule of law.
China, with its enormous size and complex national circumstances, its difficult governance is rare, and without a united, strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper stated that over the past 70 years, China had overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th year of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved historic achievements and made historic changes in its development, and the Chinese nation has taken a great leap from standing up to being rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national renaissance.
This path of development in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.

In an interview with Loureno Bartholomei, President of the Brazilian Association of Fashion Designers, the publication of the World Distribution Declaration helped countries to jointly upgrade the development of the textile industry chain and achieve the sustainable development of the textile industry.
Loureno Bartholomei, an example of Brazil’s Association of Fashion Designers, with more than 130 high-end local dressmaking brands, whose designers are committed to designing fashion, high-end dressmaking products, and Kobashi’s variety of fine fabrics, states that “through this conference, we also look forward to establishing links with the excellent suppliers of Kobashi and seeking more opportunities for cooperation.”
As the venue of the World Congress of Marketing, Kebashi, with its world's largest textile market, is gradually building a new pattern of upgrading and opening up to the interior, with its unique entire textile chain, representing China's textile image at the forefront of the world.
The Secretary of the Ko Bridge District Commission, Shen Zhijiang, said that Ko Qiao would be an opportunity to move the textile industry towards a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win world, as a pioneer.
Reciprocal counter-cyclical impact at 460 points, with the renminbi intermediate price calculated by the Reuters at around $7.0883.
Reuters calculates the renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism published by the China Exchange and Exchange Centre (CFETS), which is expected to be around $7.0883 on Friday against the United States dollar, a decline of about 154 points from the previous day.
The last Japanese renminbi received $7.1315 in exchange for the United States dollar, while the median price was $7.0729.
According to the pricing mechanism, of today's intermediate price movements, 586 points of decline reflect the impact of market supply and demand, while another 27 points of decline reflect the number of points required for a basket of exchange rates to remain essentially constant overnight; and 460 points of increase reflect the “reverse cyclical factor” effect.
Reuters calculated the median value of the last Japanese renminbi against the United States dollar at 7.0947 yuan, and the actual difference of 218 points between the value published by the Exchange Centre.
Last-day Reuters calculated on the basis of the intermediate price estimates published by CFETS, the renminbi exchange rate CFETS index, the reference SDR (Special Drawing Rights) basket index and the reference BIS (Bank for International Settlements) basket index, 91.26, 91.46 and 94.92, respectively.
The first high building in the north of China, Tianjin Chow, was completed with more than 100 national patents.
The completion ceremony of the Tianjin Chou Dafu Finance Centre in China’s 1st High Building in Tianjin, which took place on the afternoon of 26 in the New Zone in Tianjin, marked the success of the co-management platform of the high precision BIM model in the field of building skyscrapers, which was developed autonomously by the Project Department of the Tianjin Chou Fou Finance Centre in China.
The Tianjin Dafu financial centre, located in the economic and technological development zone of the city of Tianjin, with a total construction area of 390,000 square metres, 4th basement, 100th basement, height of 530 metres, covering class A offices, luxury apartments, superstar hotels, etc., will become an important part of the internationalized landmark complex of Tianjin.
The head of the project department of the Tianjin Cho Dafu Financial Centre in China reported that the project as a whole used more than 70,000 tons of steel, about 376,000 metres of welding equal to 42.5 knots of Everest, 40 laps of the Earth with welds, 42,000 pieces of steel, more than 50 per cent of which were non-marked, including the double tube ellipse pole, which created the world ' s largest single-storey distorted angle of up to 90 degrees.
The complexity and difficulty of processing the steel structure of the Tianjin Dafu project is unprecedented.
According to industry sources, the Tianjin Cho Dafu Financial Centre has taken the lead in the implementation of the building information model (BIM) throughout the country in the construction of skyscraper buildings already built or under construction.
Creatively proposed and successfully implemented a full-scale, professional-wide, process-wide “triple BIM applications” model, and a collaborative management platform based on a high-precision BIM model was developed.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that during the construction of Dafu Zhou, the project department began the BIM construction in the virtual world, followed by scientific verification, followed by the physical construction of the material, thus eliminating in the bud the problems that might arise from dismantling and returning to work as a result of the construction work in the past.
In 2017, the BIM innovation of the Zhou Dafu Finance Center project won the first prize from the Global Engineering Industry Award for Global Excellence at the Global AU Masters and the 2017 Awards for Global Excellence in Engineering.
During the construction of the project, the Ministry produced more than 130 national patents.
It is worth mentioning that the success of the BIM innovation and the promotion of science, technology and innovation under the Tianjin Dafu project not only resulted in the achievement of one-time excellence in the complex and extensive construction process, which was shortened by more than four months, but also led to significant improvements in security management, among other things.
Not long ago, the Tianjin Cho Dafu Financial Centre project also won the 2019 ISA International Security Award.

Taiwan scholars have argued that the “indeterminate times” marketers need to keep pace with the continent's mainstream industries.
The “2019 Business Innovative Business Models Forum” was held in Taipei on 26, 27 days a day and two days.
The event invited a number of representatives of broadcasters and scholars to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market development.

The two days were divided into workshops on transition and upgrading models, business strategies, etc., which were attended by more than 100 participants.
Chen Myung-hoon, President of the Taipei Institute of Management, stated that the trade friction between China and the United States persisted and that Taiwan was facing an “indeterminate era”.
In his view, it was necessary to keep pace with the times and keep pace with the mainstream industries developing on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"The past has been about quality, effectiveness and delivery."
According to Chen Mingjian, these conditions alone are no longer sufficient at this time.
He referred to the need for firms to combine speed and services, speed up supply chains, and focus on extension and product services.
In addition, “service value added” is a new area in which businesses can significantly develop.

New regulations for consultation: qualification for access to rural land by social capital
Qualified access to rural land by social capital
Public consultation to regulate the transfer of social capital to land rights, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published an open notice for comments on the Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Revised Draft Comments) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Views), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital to land, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system, and to implement the “triple power-sharing” system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management System, resulting in a Draft Opinion.
The Beijing Young News reporter learned of several important changes to the first published Draft Opinion.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act defines the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of “triple separation of powers”, with a special section on “the right to contract land” and “the right to operate land”, making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps and the transfer of land administration rights (rents, turnkeys, shares or other).
In this Draft Opinion, in order to implement the concept of the “triple separation of powers” and respond effectively to the thrust of the amendments to the Rural Land Contracting Act, and taking into account the significant differences between the transfer of land and the transfer of land contracting rights, in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land, including by leasing, entering into equity, etc., by changing the regulatory title from the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management Scheme to the Rural Land Administration Transfer Management Scheme.
Transfers, swaps and swaps of land contracting rights will be regulated separately.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the “triple division of power”, farmers are credited only for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers only run the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, thus providing for the return of the contracting land to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the insolvency law.
In response to the protection of farmers against the risk of land loss, priority shares, first-to-rent, back-purchase, etc., have emerged in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares already have more mature theoretical explorations of company law, it is suggested that they be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of market loss.
