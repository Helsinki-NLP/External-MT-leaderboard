The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing the travel of citizens with a social card of the inhabitant of the Ivanov region is changed.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of travel allowances in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual calculations on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 "On the national payment system".
The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The conditions of its application are changing accordingly.
So, the limit of replenishment is now not set in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in summer period - not more than 800 rubles per month.
Now, social cardholders will have to keep track of their travel receipts, not the number of remaining trips, but the amount of money left over.
The fare for the citizens is half the fare of the carrier.
The rest of the cost of the trip is covered by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with money remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social card system will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on the social map with a penny.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the money you have already paid but have not spent.
We should also add that the scheme of mutual settlement with carriers is becoming transparent, since now half of the fare is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged for credit card deposits.
In his turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made using the social map in the region, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides more than 470 million rubles for the provision of a social card for citizens.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to killing his girlfriend.
During the 911 call, a high school professor named Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb pointed out that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contact information of the deceased's family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly handwritten on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", according to the note, according to authorities, signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then driven 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed the highly respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the shooting was reported at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that honest 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more, Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, law enforcement officials were still trying to piece together the motives behind Lamb's actions.
Information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a portrait of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Goethe, where Prentiss died, said he had no criminal or violent charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the "wonderful people" he had met in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke highly of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him".
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him about his struggles with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He's only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes to university admissions meant that the doctorate Lamb worked so hard for would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "it was obvious that Mr. Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Police raided Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus as he made his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber revolver in the backyard of his home, a mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Mettle Johnson said.
His car with the engine still running was parked on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up around there.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play guitar for years.
He was a success with women in those years.
All the girls were fat when he was around", says Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Brandon suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating for a while at the time.
Lamb said in the 911 call, "I killed my wife", but there's no marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goethe in a brick house with a backside overlooking the canal.
The police say the dog is fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, revealed that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19.
"She's really depressed", O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit Julep Room in the suburb of Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip-syncing to a small crowd.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We had fun and made jokes about each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, taught first-year seminars and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to produce by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to police statements that Lamb's call to 911 came after Schmidt's murder, and also because although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announced that it will not be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while the toy and children's goods retailer assures that it will allow full-time and temporary staff to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale outlets across the country, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it would begin interviewing applicants this month and increase staff numbers from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still a few months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and in sales, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about going on a date with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a momentous event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and I realized that Princess Diana was sitting next to me", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts, and I'm literally one fake eyeball away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"To me", says Spielberg, "this is without question the greatest time-travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly's ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements within the council, as well as between Syrians and local authorities, "have made the situation insoluble".
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have shown in dealing with the Iranian nuclear program and in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 polls that show Donald Trump isn't kidding
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others shrugged off it as a joke.
And some of them want a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead in double digits, and some are starting to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of his chances of getting nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance of being the Republican nominee.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his way to the rising popularity of Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would run in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super Political Action Committee and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump's unwavering power and start to raise their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a middleman:
Trump's approval ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these things are dominating in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are in favor of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would have Trump as their candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were to be a candidate.
Only two in 10 say they'd be "disappointed" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in line for excitement?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disappointed" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush were to run.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted Monday.
The same number is at the nation's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he's the man who could be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he's not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn't right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their know-it-all hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely winner of the GOP nomination was, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's not the case anymore, when four out of 10 put Bush in the pocket at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters never had the right magic crystal.
Meanwhile, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans voted for Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported Mitt Romney as the likely candidate.
However, it does show that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign compelling.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that this spread is likely to play to Trump's advantage, and at the same time those who don't support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 ahead of Walker, 19 ahead of Jeb Bush, and 33 ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's been around him?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by a whopping 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump supporters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that they'll never change their mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's toughest competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rape" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the most talked about topic in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's endorsement will dissuade key Latino voters from the Republican Party and prevent a rebranding effort.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration is the focus of attention, it looks like Donald Trump will stay the same.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with experience in government, according to a new ABC/Post poll Monday.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "outraged".
The government will decide the fate of the pension indexation in October.
Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets said that the government is looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports RG.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, when the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulation of pensions of Russians.
Hungry noted that the sum of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
That's about the same as indexing your full pension for the next year.
According to the vice-premier, there is no final decision yet on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Hunger believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet was considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do eyelids often become irritated and red?
The answer is from the doctor-ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashov:
Our eyelids are like blinds that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that settle on it.
Forgetting to clean our eyelids regularly, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet eye dryer.
Clean the edges of the lids at least once or twice a day from the accumulated harmful substances.
The cleansing procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with herbs (shalfe, chamomile) that dilute the dense secretion of the salivary glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingertips.
Do not use alcohol when washing your makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further thicken the secretion of the salivary glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korea's nuclear power plant in Yongbyon is operating at full capacity, authorities said.
The announcement was made on the website of the country's Central Telegraph Agency.
It said the DPRK was ready to respond to "the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States" at any time, and that the country had improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The North Korean government last tested a nuclear weapon in 2013.
However, no plans to restart the reactor have been announced since then.
Pyongyang claims it has succeeded in creating a nuclear warhead.
North Korea has also tested short- and medium-range missiles, according to the report.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the Russian anthem be removed from the reference to brotherly nations.
The leader of the LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, believes that the mention of the brotherly nations' union should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the State Duma meeting, reports "Russian News Service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand", said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrains, which contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the king saves", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced by the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts refugees or not, but whether we need to address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans care about refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the matter.
"That's the whole point of the refugee issue", he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to dialogue in the name of reaching consensus.
But if we want real success, it's not possible as long as people are dying, as long as there is bloodshed and as long as people don't feel completely safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria", Assad said.
Recall that this year, about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current global migration crisis is the largest since World War II.
Thousands of Islamic State militants may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to set up their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of a German town have organized a celebration for refugees.
Germany has become the leader in receiving refugees in the last month, although it has recently tightened border controls to keep the influx of refugees at bay.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the numbers significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, a city where migrants are very welcomed.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at the Prime Minister 's questions session
After Mr. Corbin 's election , his debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Session is eagerly awaited .
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be making his first appearance at a question session with the Prime Minister, first time to face David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will deliver the first of six questions this afternoon, and his speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at the weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he might miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader; it will come after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual trade union congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem performance in office on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of Conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several front-page articles.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had "stood in reverential silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements over economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements are also "humping up" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told a trade union conference that the Labour Party had introduced amendments to abolish the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later Mr Smith, the shadow Minister for Labour and Pensions, stated that there was "complete clarity" within the party on the account that it was only in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met at the courier box in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he "involved collective resources" to get ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP said the Prime Minister's issues were too confrontational and that he would refrain from witty responses and exchanges of gossip, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will take over as prime minister when he is away - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, saying he was approaching House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "fair-ball" political style often associated with the PM's questions procedure, but admitted years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, Prime Minister Questions has become a key indicator of the leader's views, his ability to run the House of Commons and his reputation with other members of Parliament, although critics say it has become a caricature and requires sweeping reforms.

The pound rises as wages rise in Britain
The pound rose on the back of rising UK wages, with the FTSE 100 rising thanks to a bid to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009 and was met as a carry-over of the forecast for possible price increases.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
The overall background was SABMiller shares, which rose by 20% thanks to a purchase offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would have united the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on the back of encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales figures have exceeded all expectations and show that sales in China, Burberry's key market, have started to grow again.
Glencore's stock rose 5% after the mining giant announced that it had raised $2.5 billion through a share offering, which was done as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of Mondi, a paper and packaging group, led the index's fall - by 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to sell.
JD Sports shares rose after the sportswear supplier reported an 83% increase in pre-tax earnings in six months to £46.6m.
JD Sports' chief says higher salaries could hinder expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the rising cost of labor, he says.
The cost could affect JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi 's onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food wholesaler has launched a campaign to protect IGA's market share in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi's upcoming $700 million investment.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining the campaign, such as Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo's, which offers tastings in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - the day the wholesale supplier of food, liquor and consumer goods will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as IGA-branded stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be proponents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - over 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirath, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Africa and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of revenue and food sales at a high level of fixed costs could cost Metcash about 13 million in pre-tax and interest income, Mr. Kirat estimates.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that's despite a recent study by Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to those attending a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it's believed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's revenue from its food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational deliverables and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending more than $150 million annually to match retail prices at Coles and Woolworths at 1,000 positions a week and helping IGA retailers to redesign their retail locations, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price equalization and retail space redesigns are gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will see net profit increase in 2017, the first in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for her behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyros and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo and often referred to as "Special Ks", unwittingly became the center of attention because of a shameful confrontation between Kyrios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, during a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the tower had to separate Cockkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "The spade should have been on Kyros's shoulder, and I should have been on that guy's shoulder".
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Ryszard Gaskie from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been a devoted defender of Kokkinakis.
Young is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grote for the right to be second to Bernard Tomic in the singles event in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict", Healy said.
He did break his racket when he got his leg knocked out at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his racket when the odds were against him, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But he's actually been very good in some pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison and so on, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits in the team perfectly, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected off the court, he's trained hard, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to let Kyros go for the important match starting on Friday, believing a "mutual agreement" was the right outcome for everyone, but hoping the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not on the controversy around [Cyrus]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have proven, he's growing in the public eye, he's made a number of serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so he can reflect on them, and that's what's best for the team and what's best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, detained migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed its border with Serbia on Tuesday at its southern border and is holding back those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants gathered on the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
After being stranded for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland set up tents and settled in this area.
However, discontent grew.
As a police helicopter circled overhead, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared the deportation of migrants back from Hungary "unacceptable" as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement would be reached under which EU member states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The declaration of a state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and expedite asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major "narrow spot" and border crossing point for migrants from the European Union, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of war that are entitled to protection, and this view is in sharp contrast to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're making it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to approve the deployment of troops, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been observing the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's national security adviser, Djerde Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border at the border and 15 more inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of seven crossings on the Serbian border on Tuesday morning, with a railway car wrapped in barbed wire blocking one of the crossings.
Riots broke out at the main border crossing near the city of Rjósk, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service room for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would be denied food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernard Sanders has been cut in half in a national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to run for president, is receiving the support of 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
With more than five months to go before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided which candidate they'll support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support in some demographic groups, and Sanders has gained some bonuses.
Clinton has a big lead among women and moderates, but that lead has shrunk.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by the Democratic voters under 50 is gone, and they and Sanders are now on par.
However, Clinton still has a large lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton outnumbered Sanders by two digits among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of primary Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more conflicting, with only about a quarter enthusiastically supporting her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her to run, the most popular response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about the association that ties her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called the consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president considers a potential run-in, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race - though a third believe he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see second among the party candidates, primary Democratic voters in most cases name Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the contenders to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who see him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Yet, when asked what matters most in a candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than the odds of being elected.
As with last month, none of the Democratic nominees or potential candidates are unacceptable nominees for these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest, trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden is the leader of the three in honesty, and Clinton's strength is her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no definite opinion of him on this issue.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email and server as Secretary of State continue, most primary voters in the Democratic Party are satisfied with her explanation and believe it has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But it's a different story for the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the story was made public.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both do, however, score well on leadership.
Of the six candidates we tested, Biden, Carson and Bush have the best honesty scores.
Most people see Sanders as more of an honest man than a bad guy, but like Carson, many people have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to a national poll, Ben Carson is closest to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in his latest CBS/New York Times poll.
These two candidates have won half the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else looking for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, with his support rising from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson has soared from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also showed Carson enjoying support across all demographic groups, pushing Trump out of the group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, backed out along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has dropped from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's rise in the polls, showing support of 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
In light of Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical statements to the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during his closing campaign speech in Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged in the death of Baruch College freshman
About two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chan "Michael" Deng during a dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death", police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student and a 30-pound backpack with sand on the back were pushed several times as he tried to reach the target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The Delta Psi Phi fraternity didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and waited about an hour before they could get him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as Police Chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the fraternity members began to hide their personal belongings, essentially putting the fraternity's well-being ahead of Michael Deng's health", said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained multiple blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity initiation rituals, with at least one student dying during them every year since 1970", said Douglas Firberg, an attorney representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County jury has ruled in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assault on a rookie and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this officially or unofficially, then it too", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the National Brotherhood excluded the local chapter from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
You have a rate hike, and the bull market stumbles, the bond yields rise, and the economy plunges into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna be before it hits, and how long it's gonna last.
Specifically, for economics, history has little to say about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The Fed's toughness in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That's why the Fed is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it starts raising rates, but how long it takes to adapt.
Actually, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the hype surrounding the rate hike is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the wake of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a client commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
That doesn't mean there won't be consequences, though.
Here's a look at how some sectors of the economy might have responded to historical trends:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, expecting rates to rise could lead to volatility for a while.
When the stakes are raised, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It is unlikely that stock returns will slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again likely reflects a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
Specifically, the market has more often shifted dramatically over the past 35 years or so - about 14 percent - toward higher rates, remained fairly flat for 250 days after that (an average increase of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock trading strategy officer at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate hike stage, and equity earnings start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play a role in contributing to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in a position that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the entire time that the rate has been raised.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 instances of rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal annual GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, with the third quarter holding at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in such an unstable economic environment can be risky and raises the question "whether this time will be different", Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing for the Federal Reserve's rate hike all year, with their eyes on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only suggesting a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all rate-raising cycles since 1950 to the present day have been in the supercycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP overlapping pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of recovery", says the report.
By contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, and it's been 74 months.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one that is being realized for stocks.
The key difference is that bonds will have a faster impact than stocks when the Federal Reserve changes its strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it seems like the yield changes the vector right after the first rate hike/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, the yield of bonds immediately falls", reports Deutsche.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring the yields of long-term and short-term bonds closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although "we still fear fluctuating yields", says Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System's policies.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, yield curve flattened, credit spreads expanded, volatility increased - all characteristics of the market in the tightening of the Federal system.
In general, companies that do their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse off, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks have been performing above market for three months after the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with stable financial position have outperformed companies with unstable financial position on the results of each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-return companies and low-volatility stocks also performed better than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is gonna be a big deal.
The companies with the highest floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock market transactions, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Investors could also see a profit through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", claims Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for "lowering standards".
Proves that it's becoming less and less distinctive from its commercial competitor.
Also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply a rip-off of the Brits
My fellow MP Damien Collins, who came down on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM", the leader of the MPs said, urging the broadcaster to prove it does anything commercial companies don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seemed as if the public service station was "going dumb" and becoming less and less distinctive from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that came to mind first, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market", Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 I'm not learning about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performance and music making is really unparalleled.
"It's also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new work", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC subsidiary to be attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC has bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
You see why this program is often criticized for its lack of originality and distinctiveness?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not see the need to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed to its maximum in August, and it could be due to Black Friday.
Online sales increased by seven percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales picked up three years ago thanks to mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could have helped curb spending
In about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain's central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs of equalization now, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed the lowest growth since records began in 2000, rising by just five percent.
Experts say there are signs of equalization now, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they always had a reasonable explanation", said Andy Malcahi, editor of the IMRG sales index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales picked up three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any setting, like sitting on a couch.
But now it's going up to the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers may have abstained from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rushed to the computer to take advantage of the bargains, taking down a number of retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers engage in a real battle for bargains, could have caused people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 in every 5 pounds is spent online.
As for goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are more willing to buy clothes and shoes online than in the fashion stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury victims of crane crash in Mecca, and Bin Laden's family is under sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets as the first burial begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world have poured into the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died in the crane collapse at the main mosque in Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, the funeral attendants filled the driveway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who made their last journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fallen on the parishioners.
The bodies were given away for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the crane collapse at the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was four-child father Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman today stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow up when the crane was down.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press, says the Binladin Group is partially responsible for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not give details, but reported that the company's leaders were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane falling in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flock to perform the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and not properly coordinating its actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of a massive construction project being undertaken by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been a close ally of the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades, overseeing major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a son of a traitor, whom his family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred amid heavy winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials agreed to pay one million riyals (about £174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount to the irreparably maimed.
The other victims will get half of that.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money
According to Veronica Lowry, the British are increasingly hiring repairmen.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result - opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for specialists
Kingfisher is simultaneously closing 60 B&Q warehouse stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say the British are putting away hammers and paintbrushes and instead are hiring skilled Eastern Europeans to do the work in the house.
If you can handle a hammer or paint walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because, according to the company that owns B&Q, people in the UK are increasingly hiring skilled workers to do the simple chores around the house.
Veronique Lowry, the new CEO of Kingfisher, a home improvement chain, said that the trend was driven by a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craft goods and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouse stores.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women on the staff at B&Q, as eight out of 10 shopping decisions are made by women of the weaker sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
She said that recent demographic trends are also being noticed, with an increasing number of single women households doing more home improvement than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly man-owned.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in decision making.
Ms. Lowry - one of five women at the helm of the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index - has also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company where exactly 50 percent of the executives are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women to serve on the board was easy.
After the group took over the closing costs, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
The time of the decision on the Federal Reserve 's interest rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank hold a two-day meeting to discuss the most important decision of the day: whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do this last week now believe it will delay and keep the rate in the current range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve cut rates to zero.
This is the first time we're approaching the point where the central bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubidé, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is running efficiently, the economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for change, but all signs point to their confidence that the odds are against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 P.M. CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" hundreds of refugees chant at the Horghosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.

Asylum seekers are already starting to see other routes to the EU.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another one is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Šidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been ordered by the authorities to continue without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is already a European problem.
It is not easy to solve, and no country in Europe can do it alone, especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border for refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone claims to be a refugee, they have to fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country, because it's perfectly safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not going to stop there: he plans to erect a similar barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
Wangelis Meimarakis: Europe wants to help us.
Vangelis Meimarakis was for a number of years part of the centre-right governments that led, in the opinion of the left, the country to financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Wangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy is on par with it in popularity.
What's changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and a growth outlook.
Now the country is again in budget deficit and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras kicked them out.
Over the last nine months, the Greeks have had a chance to assess the situation the country was in in January, and Mr. Tsipras' false promises.
And now they can easily compare what they've been promised with what's actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse than in January, when the situation improved, and this was true for most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the elections you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Wangelis Meimarakis: The point is, as we've learned over the last few years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programs were or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties came together to implement the program they had agreed upon, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you keep that agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?
Wangelis Meimarakis: We actually voted for Greece to go on the European path, because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Europe is helping us now by subsidizing our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, we have the Juncker package and we have help in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there were no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of Mr. Tsipras' negotiating style.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government, within its first year in power, wants to bring order, acts rationally and shows that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession that is leading to it can be renegotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to think that we can return to negotiations with our creditors within the first year of the new agreement, because they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must unlock for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key policy issues during the negotiations, which we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of what farmers' incomes are.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras's ministers never talked about it.
So the Greek ministers were not prepared and they were not well informed, and so they failed to negotiate and they failed to make a deal.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be sitting at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Wangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to implement the 2012 agreement as best we could, bypassing the sharp corners that were in it.
We pushed the reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price the Greek government agreed.
I was the speaker of the parliament at the time, and I managed to get the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the majority in the government, together.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, and mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we've managed to get the country back to normal, which would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general election that resulted in the December presidential election.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees in Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of European countries that these people are trying to reach?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will have to deal with after we win the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should.
You should be quick about these things, because if the problem hits you, all you have to do is take emergency measures.
And that's exactly where we are right now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is being helped by the president of the republic, who has called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees are able to leave the country, and notice, refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They're victims of the war in Syria, victims of some kind of emergency that happened to them.
This is a matter of profound humanitarian concern and we will take the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The EU summit should make a decision, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more efficient border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic aid we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelys Meimarakis: Thank you very much.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka of the Donetsk region, during the day, the criminal investigation officers of the regional police headquarters together with the military counter-intelligence team identified and detained a suspect, a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who had fired a shot from an automatic weapon at his opponent the night before during a joint drinking and a conflict in the village of Verchneterkom of the Yasinovatsk district of the Donetsk region.
A 22-year-old man was reported injured in a hospital where he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to his leg.
According to Artem Vasitskiy, deputy chief of the criminal investigation department of the regional police chief, during the course of the operation, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the defendant in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The officers determined that on the same day, a conflict occurred between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head.
The investigative department of the Druzhkovsky District opened a criminal investigation under the articles "Killing" and "Killing" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The prisoner faces up to 15 years in prison.
The suspect was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the Donetsk region police press service reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, were sentenced to prison by a Russian court.
Two other townspeople were sentenced to time served.
The prisoners in Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts were given 14 and 18 months' imprisonment.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism in relation to the monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the KPRF regional committee and on the street of the Tricotage, as well as the memorial complex "Monoment of Glory".
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile system and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of December 12 in Novosibirsk, Russia, unknown persons painted the colors of the Ukrainian flag on the military equipment at the Monument of Glory.
The civil wife of popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov, Irina Leonova, gave birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
Recall that recently Gypsy and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames everything on her husband and his ambitions.
Yevgeny Tsiganoff is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Petro Fomenko's Workshop".
He is known for the films "Promenade", "Cosmos as a feeling", "Brest fortress", the series "Ottepel" and "Fars".
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing.
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regrets" the first killing and would like to "give it all back", authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gottier, Mississippi, say a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He reported, "Last night I killed my wife", and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house who "would not hurt anyone", but was probably upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm sorry, I'd like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and then committed suicide on Monday night, surrounded by police.
University Chancellor William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb had suspected an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials reported on Tuesday that there was "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was referred to as "a good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter who's 19 and she's "uncomfortable".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, who the Sun Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss's, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she'd been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people".
According to police, Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail".
That evening, when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university's website, Lamb received his Ph.D. in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had some rough years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime life partner, Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly played a part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for a few months with a double fracture .
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will keep him off the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless kick in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw stormed into PSV's penalty area.
He was given field care for nine minutes and oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital".
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he'll have surgery.
It's terrible -- a guy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcomes a lot of obstacles and starts playing fantastically, and then this happens.
He had an oxygen mask in his locker room.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and he didn't get a penalty.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourselves when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
That was a very bad two-legged slide.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my road to recovery is beginning, I will be back even stronger than I was".
Manchester United are suffering from Luke Shaw's loss to PSV
The English defender will have an extra boost to qualify for the European Championship in France next June.
Philippe Kokku, coach of PSV, said: "It is a very serious injury".
When any player leaves with an injury like that, everyone gets very upset.
It was never our intention to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against the Van Gaal-led Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad", Koko said.
I didn't get a chance to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball flying in the other direction, so it looked like he was touching it, but I didn't see Luke's swing.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it's like, I know how hard it is to deal with it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm really sorry.
PSV's Andres Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
One thing every parent learns very quickly is that if your child likes a book, it will be some time before you know it almost by heart.
I guess, unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a representative of a holiday company about his favourite children's book, the prime minister chose "The Lorax", an ecologically-minded tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a powerful message that I love to read to my children because it always finds some image or message that we miss".
And it would be fine, except for the last paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to retell the book's content, but actually tells the story of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the fairly short original narrative.
"In the walled city of Vsemnuzhville, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", reads the text's description of the love story of an unknown Dr. Sue (real name Theodore Sue Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the film The Lorax, as posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the walled city of Vsemnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
It seems unlikely that Cameron, an admittedly active parent, would be so unfamiliar with the contents of the book in which the unnamed boy learns about the environmental destruction of greedy tree-cutter and "sweetheart" weaver Nahodkins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is inserted in the book's title) - a funny, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees".
It's likely that this simple PR task was assigned to a performer who had never read a book about the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment was forthcoming.
For Adam Leith, there was clearly a risk of not being in the England squad, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough challenge, but looking at the England team that has been selected for this tour, repeating the 3-0 Test series defeat that happened last time doesn't seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out a win on my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has some of the best defensive players and a strong team spirit; they're not going to bring the scars of 2012, they're going to bring the youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moen Ali becomes a bowler, passing spin balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, represents an attacking option.
Adam Leet has been dropped from the England Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to dismiss Adam Leith is difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyse.
In his seven Test matches, he had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricketers are judged by the judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) the players are best at choosing themselves.
A couple of hundred and fifty, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more hits for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England national team, Trevor Bailiss, has spoken highly of his spirit, even when he hasn't shown what he's capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first and then everything else.
The question of how long it takes for a Test batsman to make an impression is a difficult one.
Leet played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton gets to play on their own and on someone else's.
The only thing you could complain about is that England picked Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Leet was at his best, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman that I value highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but that will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow the addition of an extra spinner, keeping four fast bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not opposed to it at all.
I don't see why a batsman can't catch a ball there, and this left-hander has already shown he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moen may not be the man for his county of Worcestershire, but he's number three for them, and there's not much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a third-row before leaving as an opening batsman in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the national team as a reserve spinner, and in my brief interaction with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his average of 31 at bat and 35 at ball and think it's a risky bet, but there are few spinners who vote for him, and the selectors chose young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahella Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Tests could be a masterful move.
He's one of the best guys to play the game, who's going to bring in the richest experience he's ever had in any situation and any attack.
Paul Collingwood is involved in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both the energy and the relentless pace of the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they're saying things that have already been said, can give a team new strength.
Durham's teammates Ben Stokes is on day one, Ruth is on similar break for Australia, and I, for one, have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and players do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
These decisions are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy is in a depression by 2017
David Cameron's reckless policy of resuming the negotiations on Britain's stay in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without looking at the election of the brilliant Jeremy - "Is that yes or no?" - Corbyn as Labour leader or TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbin and Nigella Farage too.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that in the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of which are of its own making - some member states are fed up with the British egocentric agenda of sowing discord by making concessions and undermining agreements for changes that they basically don't want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC decided that it didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it the Dave and George selfie program.
The prime minister and the finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or not, then come home and say they're attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the European Union's umbrella - "Don't leave us with France", says Berlin - suggests that the busy ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when it doesn't matter whether we stay or go.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, as they have for her successors Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his strength, too.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to see them coming out of their skins to help the British selfies, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they also don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even be planning to deliberately issue useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the process of Britain leaving the EU, my friend suggests.
"Review was a fix", and "Britain gained nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations".
Europeans know, to their dismay, what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the media moguls are of the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the deep-rooted European opportunist who became famous for his "EU banana-straight" Brussels correspondent in the early '90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a ragtag company of tax-crazed crooks, phone-hacking outsiders and the aliens who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a wild gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you at lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum idea, as Blair had compromised principles in favour of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him the winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of it.
But the gentleman Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no more time to spend on me - seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat on in the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist Ukip and wider "Little England" Tory circle can probably say yes to this.
It's the same thing that Hillary "Benn but not Bennett" Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the unbearable John McDonnell as "shadow" Treasury Secretary was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his great-grandfather was fighting hard on TV for disloyalty to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
Hillary's was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "in any circumstance" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.K. told the peers and members of parliament in a private meeting on Monday night, in the public's mind.
Whatever the Democrat and his "boyfriend" Corbin might say - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messaging remains important in an age of 24/7 television, and especially in a social media whirlwind, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily by allowing him to take the Labour support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But the fundamental misconception of McDonnell and Corbin about EU membership - within the framework of the "Benit" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of minor differences, is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that J.K. will not campaign for a withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on British concessions when it might all be pointless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak British military operations in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the incumbent Tory government is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday at a lunchtime forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the e-cigarette review by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in collaboration with the Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published a landmark report last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the veracity of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these claims had "solid or shaky foundations".
Martin McKee, a lecturer in European health organisation at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capwell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of health is that rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said the public expects PHE's claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a multi-criteria analysis model of decision making in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
It also confirmed the BAT certificates in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation was provided for the board members' choice, but there are several prominent e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom have also stated industry funding in publications.
It's not clear if the other participants in the meeting have any experience managing tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco sector at PHE.
The scientific paper published by the group "graciously agrees" that there is a lack of "substantial evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria", McKee and Capwell wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capwell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes are a road leading children or non-smokers to smoking" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ had previously responded to the claims.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers died from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is and is not proved by this evidence, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative hazard compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
I've made it clear that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only a fraction of the damage that smoking does, we are doing our duty to the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes the BBC should stop EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing shows like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would pay a lot for successful shows like the soap opera about Albert Square.
Johnson noted that the licence fees should only be used to create programmes that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasts that are likely to be watched by a small number of viewers, at peak times when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to work with the BBC for six years while working for Channel 4.
"I can't shake the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive subsidies", Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's further investigation.
If you keep the licensing fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium to long term, then companies should only keep on air programs that are not being released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice is going to be broadcast in prime time because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding broadcasts that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; they're known to be self-produced.
Other channels would have paid a lot for it.
I don't see how this is a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would demean the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambition of the staff and their belief that it is the best way to get long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky Executive Director Tony Ball, who in his 2003 MacTaggart memorial lecture in Edinburgh suggested that the BBC sell EastEnders-style series.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more niche public programmes "continue to go on BBC4 where often the audience cannot be assessed, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be argued in the hungarian sermons justifying the £4 billion in licence fee revenue: 'well yes, of course we do all these incomprehensible programmes that nobody watches'.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but for people who think 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, they think that because they don't really watch or listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission in favour of "informing, educating and entertaining".
He noted that only a small fraction of BBC content is now formally classified as educational - 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should follow the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Switch Concerts" (only a fraction of which, he said, are shown on TV), and also enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells with sound waves.
This video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound waves too loud for the human ear to hear.
The pulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers control brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms were demonstrating the potential of a new technique called "sonogenetics", which involves using ultrasound to stimulate certain cells in the brain, heart, and muscles, with the source of the ultrasound located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasanni, a research fellow at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Challasani found that they started to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels", found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are connected to them, reports a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that could be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
When using ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms' bodies, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in "optogenetics", a new field that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalaisani argues that compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain via fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves travel unimpeded through body tissues, so they do not need to travel inside the skull to be delivered.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses could temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal", Chalasanni said.
He added that the technique could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video of the protest against the arms exhibition.
These are awesome killer drones!
The shaving iron chains!
The tape bombs!
Electric light-noise sticks that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The lively voice and animation leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms show is a stinging parody, prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" arms to repressive regimes, using the ExCeL Defence Technology and Security Exhibition in Docklands.
Also on topic: DSEI arms show: authoritarian regimes are coming to London
But the campaign also leads to a sudden surge of posters at bus stops and subway trains that demand a second look.
"Important announcement, driving on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
This September, a mob of gun dealers will storm the DLR line, asking passengers to help them stop the gun show.
300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London using a "advertising space breaker kit", a 6-pound set of key chains that is said to "provide access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops around the world".
London's transport authorities were not bothered by the "vandalism" of unauthorised posters.
One of the spoof ads that Special Patrol Group put out.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to audiences beyond galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to make an impact.
Another poster against the arms fair welcoming passengers on the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro bono agency VCCP, with a graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of the VCCP, was struck by the publicity silence surrounding the arms show -- with a gap in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They thought of creating more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling her house with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting".
"They were incredibly helpful in getting the attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition", said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art of the arms show comes from inside ExCeL, where the participants sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order for an "AT4CS RS shoulder-firing" from the US Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative payload that delivers unparalleled armor-piercing action inside the target".
Whatever he's doing, it's not going to be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dorm as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the long smiles of those I've irritated - and the many, long complaints of others.
And basically, what I've learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from a little nerve-racking to completely frightening.
It's about talking to people about where you're from, whether you've taken a vacation, where you've spent it, whether you support Corbin, and why you're "honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll keep it".
You need to take a break.
And help others to relax too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to if your eyelashes caught on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's bedrooms are often converted into drinking establishments, midnight movie theaters, and social gathering places, but they're also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
On the subject of not even thinking about going to college while you're in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories have a culture of wandering from room to room, which promotes friendship, communication and long-term friendships.
It can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave so I can get back the energy I spent communicating with you".
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not knock, text.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm had this rule: If the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a cake.
Since you're starting college at the height of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and hand them a plate of chocolate cookies is not so strange, it's not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked you something, now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions".
Offering home-cooked meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to talk to you, and your face will likely be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly bonded piles of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for your tea?
Go to the milk owner.
He will likely offer you a way out, even if he is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel for you, but try to treat that adult like my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noise that will interfere with people's sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're the same people from the glass house proverb.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to turn down the drum and bass because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor responded by raising the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then turned off her music and locked the door behind her to go to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved into the same dorm room as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, elbow-bitingly awkward if you assumed your neighbor was your future spouse, fell for him, broke off the relationship, and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart to go - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
The thrill of knowing someone left their keys inside their locked room, the line between a joke and a hoax is much thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson about safety by hiding something - but never fill someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not glue someone else's things to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after Apple releases an update
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them "Application failed to update".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the animation subsides or try to update via iTunes.
The phone's got a lead on how to get you through the process.
The process may involve deleting apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the execution with a special utility that suggests deleting apps and reinstalling them again after the process is complete.
Make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger when you upgrade to avoid battery drain.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as discharging the phone in the process could cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, Moscow's military support for President Assad only leads to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the White House chief is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made clear that continued Russian support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and is detrimental to our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power", the State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to fighting ISIS as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the U.S. "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin is not yet: "When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "losing bet".
I remember talking to Mr. Putin four or five years ago, telling him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
"But he ignored my warnings - and as a result, things got worse", the president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating vehicles for recreation and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the ministry on the instructions of the Russian government.
This was reported to "Izvestie" by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Transport Service, the Rosturism Ministry - to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On making changes to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly help create favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - noted Lashkina.
This issue was brought to the attention of the subcommittee on customs tariff, non-tariff regulation, protection measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, whose meeting took place in September, and was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional exemption for import is in essence a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, explained Lashkina.
The list of imported goods that are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, include goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control-measuring devices, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious rites.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told "News" that they have prepared mandatory regulations for the sea ports of Kersha, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatorium, which provide for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small-sized, sport sailing and pleasure boats to the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the Crimean sea ports to ensure the simplified procedure for the entry of small-sized, sport sailing and pleasure boats into the sea port and the exit of the above-mentioned vessels from the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared the draft of the Russian government's decree on the approval of the boundaries of the waters of the sea ports of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of being agreed upon, - the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state supervision, classification and certification, and state registration of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to sail precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there's a whole ever-growing industry, with a lot of people involved.
In Russia, things are pretty much stagnant.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only part where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big problem is that the border guards in this area are very strict: to go out on a yacht, you need to get a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, the yacht doesn't even have a place to refuel.
It can run for two days with its own fuel, and then the problem arises of where to get it, says Nordmarine's sales director Denis Novikov.
As for the storage of yachts, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has given Ukraine a $ 500 million loan .
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new financing will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the report said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimjao Fan said that banking sector reforms will help revive credit in the real economy and will stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan urges the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asking for separate blocks for transgender people.
The Federal Sentencing Service (FSIN) Public Council on the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite people in the colonies.
This was told to "News" by the member of the council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not determined their gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the criminal is really a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib believes that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is working successfully abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are held until the court decision) separate cells for transgender people are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
It's the only way to deal with criminals like that today.
They definitely need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a lot of problems for the FIS staff.
Humiliation of the trance by the cellmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many sex-independent criminals, you have to figure out where to put them.
SIZO doesn't need any specials, just the security cameras, the prison cells.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Gribb explained, the block could hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transsexual prisoners from any region will be able to go there to serve their sentence.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the place of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Grib.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officials could not decide which detention center - male or female - to identify the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukova (known as Alina Davis), who was detained for drug possession, which is why the man with the appearance of a girl was not arrested.
He was released on a travel ban.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, as there is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in detention centres and prisons in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that abroad it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the sentence is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, "said Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for that purpose for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prison than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to pass themselves off as transsexuals in order to get into a different colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before putting people in a transgender colony, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison, she said she wanted to change her gender, Alexeyev said.
A person can feel like anything.
But until there are separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordikpanidze, an international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the beginning of sentencing.
You have a commission, it's a sexology issue, psychiatrists do long-term observations, it's not one test that makes a high-quality conclusion.
The current state of psychiatry allows for that.
Therefore, before changing sex, potential patients are always tested - they show exactly whether a surgical sex change is a necessary measure, says Lordkapaniidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system could be implemented in the case of convicted persons, because the average examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender in Russia units.
It is difficult to count, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, we can say that transgender people are even less, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, a very small number, - said Lordkapaniadze.
Now, on petition to the colony administration, homosexuals, transgender people can get special conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world championship in chess.
The world championship in chess between juniors under 20 years old has been completed in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch the Pole Jan-Kshichtof Duda, who seemed to be confidently heading for the title.
The girls were celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa.
The World Chess Championship, held in early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue by the middle of the tournament distance, as Poland's Jan-Kshistof Duda, who had won a series of four (the competition is held in the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Considering that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the gap was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title fight.
Antipova had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dudo your game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could have affected the Russian chess player's game and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was confident in his ability to handle Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for Duda to finish his game, who was meeting Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
And that is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, whose governor, Natalya Komarova, traditionally pays much attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing ending.
The tournament's leader, Natalia Buks (Ukraine), was only able to win the title by not losing in the last round, which she did successfully.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with a 0.5 point gap from the champion.
Wimpelkom is changing the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the region of the East.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the general director of "Vympelkom" Mikhail Slobodin, changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with Russia 24 TV, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce "tens of percent" of the staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Burger King restaurants in Moscow and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Bolshoi Tula street was closed for 90 days, but resumed its work after all violations were eliminated.
43 caterers violated the requirements for the layout of the premises.
Among other violations, the sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygiene maintenance of premises was unsatisfactory, the requirements for ventilation were not observed, and some institutions detected bacteria of the intestinal stick group.
The franchise on the Burger King brand belongs to the "Burger Rus" LLC owner of the chain "Chocolate" Alexander Kolobov, in Russia there are 293 snack shops.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency is against indexing tariffs for freight transportation by 10% and providing state subsidies, as requested by OJSC RZD.
First they wanted 17 percent indexation, now they want 10 percent and then they want multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget", he says.
We say, this is wrong, this is too much, cut your expenses, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much stricter" proposals that are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on the full $300 million in shares, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal would have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the shares issued in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand a surcharge.
Details of the negotiations at Polymetal are not being disclosed.
The option was made as part of Polymetal's purchase of the "Kyzyl" project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the housing policy department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry is working with the Central Bank to develop a procedure for sanitizing developers.
"We understand that there is no way around it, so we are developing a mechanism", the official said.
The draft of the "Citizen Kane" film is going up for auction.
The auction house Profiles in History announced plans to auction off the draft version of the script for Citizen Kane, considered one of the best works by director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will begin in Kalabas on September 29, and will feature three draft versions of the script, each estimated to cost $20-30,000, the AP reports.
The first draft, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections? and is titled "The American" - the working title of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Ministry of Industry and Trade: addressed food aid will not become the analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of directed food assistance will not become an analogue of the card system of distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
It is about providing targeted food aid to the population and supporting an efficient domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the wording of "food card".
I would particularly like to point out that the food cards being offered should not be confused with the echoes of the past times of total deficits, the distribution system of cards in which the quantity of products produced is normalised.
We have proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation", TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the program to introduce food stamps for the poor has been introduced to the government.

The president of the Rosgosstrakh wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company "Rosgosstrakh" Daniel Khachaturov has filed a lawsuit in the Moscow court with the demand to terminate his marriage with the designer Ulyana Sergiyenko.
The case will be heard by the 100th Judicial District Court on September 16.
Daniel Khachaturov asks to break his marriage and divide the jointly acquired property.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that no claim for property division had been filed and would be considered in the district court.
President of the Russian Railways Alexander Bobreshov is leaving his post.
Vice-president of corporate security of Russian Railways (RJD) Alexander Bobreshov is leaving the company, Interfax reports, citing a source.
Vice-Prime Minister of Russia, chairman of the board of directors of RZD Arkady Dvorkovich stated that the issue of the departure of Alexander Bobreshov from RZD was initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the personnel changes in the management of the Russian Railways are not related to the change of the head of the company.
Earlier, "Ъ" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin, the first deputy transport minister from St. Petersburg, Oleg Belozerov, who was in charge of the financial block, headed RJD OJSC.
The new company head announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half they will create a new system of cargo tariffs.

This year, the Russian Manager Association's survey "Top 1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As an instrument for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year's rankings.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year's rating and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, who would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
The following heads of the company's functional areas may be nominated: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, personnel director, IT director, public and corporate relations director, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate management.
Each manager proposed by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new executives from other companies.
Candidates are nominated on the basis of the Manager Association's industry classifier: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry, machinery, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holding companies, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can rate their performance according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year's rating and multiple candidates for the previous years' rating are invited to the face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commission is organized according to functional characteristics: the Commission for the approval of the list of senior leaders and eight Commissions for the approval of the heads of functional directions.
At the meetings of the expert commissions it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the internet-evaluation and are closed information until the publication of the rating) or to make up-to-date adjustments according to the reserve list of candidates attached.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Ъ".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for investment credit is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year fell by 40%.
What do you estimate the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 and early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs has declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Loans at 25-30% per annum were not profitable for anyone.
If earlier the bank could have put all its possible problems in the future, from late payments to non-returns, into a higher rate, now it is impossible to do so: the rates are so clouded.
For businesses, the current level of SME loan rates is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return on investment.
A rate of 10 to 13 percent would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How much do you estimate the demand for loans from entrepreneurs is being met?
After the Central Bank lowered the interest rate, things got a little better.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, we observed that customers were seeking credit much less frequently.
First of all, business doesn't understand its prospects and future revenues.
Today, businesses have one solution: they need to learn to work with the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor the current results more closely, monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, it is worth using new technologies that allow for the modernization of equipment, reducing production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to make their products more competitive and to stay in business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the lower average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, we should not expect a drastic fall in the price of loans for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem is, first and foremost, inflation, which makes higher interest rates necessary to generate real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the Central Bank rates are lowered.
As regards the level of late payment, the traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in their ability to replenish funds and in their options for adjusting economic behaviour, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in bad credit.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how you spell the word Mazda in Japanese.
It's beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
The new CX-5 crossover is just like any other model of the brand: without any fancy, attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese, simply because of its "Japaneseness", can bring the affection for the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can make all kinds of arguments for cars from other countries, and you'll agree with them in principle, but the whole conversation will be dissolved by the final sentence, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technology but also everything else Japanese.
To quote Basse, to prepare wasabi, to collect katana, and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but in the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
I think the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls like to wear after school.
It has amazing qualities: it is both sensitive and rigorous.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the CX-5's appearance is a radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But what's even more impressive is the new design of headlights and taillights, which instantly identify the car in the traffic.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance is at the same time a touch of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest cars in the world, you can only experience the stoic calm of Japan.
The 2.2L diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this motor with a capacity of 175 l. s.- only 5,9 l. The power unit is equipped with exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
The black shoes, the black coat, the black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you could choose leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not end up in the same place as your own car.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension was redesigned with reworked front and rear shock absorbers, and the shape of the front under-levers was optimized.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A flower or striped swimsuit is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different when a girl is cuddling in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
Like a computer game in the role-playing genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design on both the front and rear seats, providing optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Long-legged people will appreciate that the supports in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't hit the ankles in the twists.
The most extensive set of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
Radar, lasers, and cameras are used to detect potential threats.
There's adaptive lighting, and lane departure warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safety braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
It is comfortable, has a minimum of protrusions, and can hold a load of 561 l. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate lift lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 l.
The costume of a cartoon character is called "kigurumi" in Japan.
The pyjamas are particularly bad-looking.
You can do anything!
Of course I want to sleep.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walking around with that animal...
It's so nice to have a choice - whether it's fun clothes, good manners, or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store material.
Kiev has broken the nuclear union.
Kiev formally refused Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday voted for the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was never implemented.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law that cancels the agreement signed in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The bill was only passed in the second round of voting, with 210 MPs supporting it, with the required minimum of 226, but then 234 MPs voted in favour of the bill in the second round.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, which was built during the Soviet Union, was originally designed to have four 1 GW power units with VVER type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the construction of blocks would have to be on credit of the Russian side, but funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to cut ties with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where the relations were preserved, remained the purchase in Russia of fuel for the operating Ukrainian NPPs (provided about half of the production of electricity in the country), as for now the Ukrainian NPAEC "Energoat" can not replace the Russian supplies.
Plans to complete the construction of the Khmelnytsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been abandoned: in 2014 in Kiev they announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Secretary General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution", the AP quotes his answer to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I'm meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria", he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not rule out the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no plans yet.
"But anything can happen", Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, "Ъ" reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the banned terrorist group "Islamic state" in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", Mr. Gerasimov was quoted as saying by TASS.
He also called for the Minsk agreements to be implemented and for "the return to normal life in our countries".
On the question of whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is possible at the moment at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of the contact group at the OSCE PA platform - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue has been held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the country's ex-president Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the municipal elections, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out according to party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during elections were made by representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who accused the electorate of "covering up falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election committee refused the party "Communists of Russia" to organize a referendum on the abolition of the payment for the renovation of multi-apartment houses.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections to the Lower Novgorod City Council for the municipal electoral district.
In all, 1.03 million people were included in the electoral lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,7 thousand were issued ballots for voting in the polling stations, and 268 thousand voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were distributed among the political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of the "United Russia", six seats in the parliament are reserved for Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elisabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rastreyev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDPR was won by the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and the Deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of the "Just Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will serve as deputies in the city duma: in case of rejection of the mandate, it goes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city election committee Alexander Макеyev informed the members of the commission that he was introducing a duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" to refuse mandates.
When the election results were approved, the KPRF representatives reported multiple violations.
The member of the city election committee with the right of consultative vote from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Leonid Krasnoukutsky proposed not to recognize the results of voting in the four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Neither the State Duma deputies nor the candidates nor the observers could enter the building for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the district administration doors was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote were allowed to attend the meetings of the county commissions.
The chief only stopped them when the voting was over and the county commissioners hadn't come to hand in their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons could attend all the meetings", - said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election committee.
The Communists objected that the administration had illegally detained the deputy of the provincial parliament, Ludmila Aristova, for more than four hours in the blocked building, and a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that a number of CECs on election day began sealing the ballot box at 6-7 a.m. and putting out ballots for early voting.
The members of the consultative voting commissions and the observers were not notified, so they came at 8 a.m.
Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the election polls opened, ballots could have been thrown into the polls uncontrollably.
However, the city election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeyev, found no violations with the inclusion of unrecorded ballots.
The commission members also did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Justice Russia" Maria Popova to amend the regional legislation through the election commission to clearly establish the time of opening the envelopes with early voting ballots, which then go into the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, at least turn to the CEC", Alexander Makeyev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was accused of high-profile crimes by a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Sergei Samohin, who shouted that the election commission ignored dozens of complaints and covered up fraudulent elections.
"You're not at a rally, be careful!" the chairman of the election commission was offended.
The protocol was approved almost unanimously.
The election committee must approve the general results of the elections by September 27, after which the first meeting of the Lower Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register the political party "Communists of Russia" as an initiative group for holding a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party members were going to bring two issues to the discussion of the people of Nijmegen: do they agree that the fees for the overhaul of multi-apartment houses should be "immediately abolished", and the tariffs for housing and communal services "frozen until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, with a decline in 2016 forecasts.
FedEx reported disappointing results last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were predicting $10.84 according to a FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite the 4.9 percent rate hike, which will take effect on January 4, and the increase in land charges for heavy or bulky goods, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year due to cost reductions, higher gross revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company "operated steadily in light of weak, compared to forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS announced that it planned to hire 95,000 more employees, about the same number it hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the average $2.44 per share forecast by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks predicted $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a slump in the international express sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transportation rose by 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to higher expenses for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division received higher income due to higher base rates, while the freight sector saw a decline in income due to higher labour costs.
At the preliminary auction about an hour before the opening, FedEx's stock fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, down 11 percent year-over-year and 17 percent below the record set on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table made of Honduran redwood, deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated two-story meeting room, there will be a wall painting of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests ahead of all others.
The central bank has received a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Federal government has recognized that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may be an unknown factor in the near-predicted decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even with most data showing solid growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal officials from adding to the volatility by raising the federal funds base rate by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important considerations", said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait any longer", she noted.
There's no consensus on what they're going to do at the Federal Reserve, which in itself is causing the financial market to fluctuate.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a higher interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal Reserve to refrain from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid upturn.
It could lead to a stock market crash if the Federal Reserve raises the rate, provided that those making the decisions don't soften the blow by promising that the next rise won't be anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The jump was triggered by expectations that the Federal Reserve's policymakers would leave the bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time", he noted.
If the Federal Reserve Board does this, "they will have to go a long way in establishing their strategy to keep the financial markets in check so they don't panic".
Other experts objected that the rate hike could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and near what the federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's target of 2 percent annually, the Federal Reserve said the key cause was the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy "can and needs to cope with higher rates, given the shrinking labor market", observed Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in China could dampen global growth.
The market has partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones is now about 10% below its May high.
For the Federal Reserve, the market upset further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate hikes.
"Without the information on what's happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would have been twisting the nuts at this meeting", said Steven D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, he predicts, they'll wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy might be, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China", Ohliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a top concern of the Federal System, and technically it should not be considered in these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial power.
The Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mute" its monetary expansion caused markets around the world to shake.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, one would expect that the heads of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve System of overreaction to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles".
Laker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising rates, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, "despite limited identifiable implications for growth in the U.S"., Lacker said.
A year later, the Federal System's executives repealed the cuts.
The Federal Reserve should only prioritize stability concerns during major crises, such as the 2008 market crash", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The last panic didn't come close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because the markets are in a state of shock", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the curve.
You need a great Thai market?
Try the LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown is
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thailand's Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tytown.
A market/store is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even an automotive department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to comb through all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking department in the store (good and cheap) is located near the cash register and offers various take-out options.
What's on offer: Do you want anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in wholesale.
Fresh produce includes delicacies of Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is as varied as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and chop the fish, and even roast it for you if you want.
The shop's main part is devoted to the impressive freezer department, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, whole duck, fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished products and much more.
Who's buying: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual customers.
In the wide passageway are placed and shopping carts, and forklifts.
Fresh durian montong found near the exit.
Location: The store is located in the industrial area of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of Chinatown and the city's business center, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees can flow to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is: is Europe not the ultimate target of those who have been so manically insistent in recent years in destabilizing the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"Surely someone had expected and knew that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and destitute people who are escaping death, would flee to prosperous EU countries", he added.
Narishkin asked: "How many European political leaders have spoken openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally engulfing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he said.
According to Naryskin, NATO is trampling on many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and is watching as moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are melted down with military boots sewn up according to NATO standards", the speaker stressed.
The government forces and the loyal paramilitary units are being opposed by insurgents, mostly Islamists.
Later, the Syrian government's opponents were joined by the banned terrorist group Islamic State.
The U.S. supports the rebels who are opposing both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus officially considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president has given the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The West's claim to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran is that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, "Rossi24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad has drawn attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant claims that Assad himself should step down, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he does, it is at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communique.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately", he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, economy and military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out", he explained.
As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperating with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see that in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIL coalition led by the US", Assad said.
The death toll has exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory has been captured by the terrorist group Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is launching air strikes against ISIL.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: The world: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has had a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters, citing State Department spokesman John Kirby.
The topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
He also said that the US has tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during his conversation with Kerry again emphasized the need to create a united front to fight terrorist groups operating in the country.
The talks also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, American officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington has said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are calling for the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory has been taken over by the terrorist organization "Islamic State".
The international coalition led by the United States is targeting ISIS positions from the air.
Boroday called the American newspaper's information a slander against Strelkov.
Former government chairman of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the Lenti.ru correspondent.
The Washington Post's nice thing is that it's completely upside down.
The former DPR defense minister Igor Strelkov, of course, was not tied down and "went out" from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very upbeat mood, without ropes, without three fur coins, which are attributed to him by different characters", he noted.
According to Borodaya, the conversation about Strelkov with a reporter from an American newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov had to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", the former head of the DPR government said.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "bound".
I suspect it was a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word, because I was emphasizing that Strelkov was leaving himself", Boroday said.
"This is slander against me and against Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared in The Washington Post, citing Borodaya's claim that he had taken Strelkov to Russia under duress.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to tie his accomplice.
The Polish authorities began searching for the Nazi gold train.
Polish loggers began cutting down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, the Third Reich's gold train is located.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the veracity of rumors about the treasure railway.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be inside the train.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to block the area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zukhovsky, had said that local treasure hunters had a "99 percent chance" of finding the legendary Third Reich gold train.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the allegations are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm reported to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbych that they had found a train in a 70 meter deep masonry tunnel.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia's chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco to anyone under 21.
Eugene Brün noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is especially harmful".
He said this in a live broadcast of the radio station "Moscow speaks", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
The human being matures unevenly.
You can join the army at 18, you're physically ready.
He's mentally ready for a full-fledged life in society at 21.
"Scientific evidence shows that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully mature by the age of 21", said Brün.
Earlier, the member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Trepid Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told "News" that Matviyenko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the floor of the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will be created in the Federation Council soon to develop the bill under the leadership of Matviyenko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Children 's Information Protection Act .
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that causes harm to their health and development", the Sib.fm correspondent got acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the "Chitai-city" store on Red Avenue.
He found fragments in the text of the book that he believes violate the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Novosibirsk city prosecutor's office.
The response to the appeal of the inhabitant of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent of Sib.fm.
And it's a very serious problem that will shock society.
He will start reading the Bible again, which he has not done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Association of Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding mothers
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women of the need for nutrition during breastfeeding: It involves showing images of infants sucking on the breast, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide all the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy requirements, pregnant and childbearing women are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research shows that a single increase in calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects gene expression in babies and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy nutrition on a child's immune system have been found.
A school bus collided with a train near Hamburg.
A train near Hamburg collided with a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they were in front of a collision.
He was caught on video by one of the schoolboys.
The emergency situation has caused panic among the students.
Some of the children started crying and running along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked.
Police say miraculously no one was hurt, except one passenger on the train, who suffered minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a boycott.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles in the International Boxing Federation (IBF) version in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magaly's knockout victory in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was put on life support.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 matches, lost only two and finished one match in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends that the sport should not be practiced, and that it should be banned altogether.
"I understand that this is unintentional", said Stephen Parnis, vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which boxing exists today, there will always be situations where an athlete suffers a hemorrhage or a brain injury that results in either death or serious injury.
For this reason, the A.M.A. believes we can't go on living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body for practising doctors and medical students.
Sergey Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to abolish sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The speaker of the Russian State Duma, Sergey Narishkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We consider this to be an unacceptable act, an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's bring morality back into politics.
Let's bring dialogue and justice back into the practice of international communication.
Let's bring the humanist ideals back into the democratic world order.
"The duality never ended well", he declared.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma urged parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge members of the assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group", Narishkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be honored.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine", the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15 in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
He is the current world champion in athletics, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul, Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the European team championship in his 110-meter hurdles, set several records, and most importantly, become world champion, the first in the history of the national hurdles sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking third place overall.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the season that is going on.
Sergei, is the season over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna be at the World Military Games in Korea in October, and then I'll be thinking about my vacation.
I'm going to be home in Barnaul, but being home is a different state.
It's easier than being around the world every week.
You once said that fall is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passion has subsided since the season's first start, the burden of responsibility has been lifted.
You can compete in pleasure, in relaxation.
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming up.
Are you tired?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
The fatigue always builds up at the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what you did more, win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant travel, constant moving, all of this doesn't go unnoticed by the body.
You're exhausted physically and emotionally.
But now I'm, of course, on the upswing.
I'm just happy.
By the time you finished the Beijing World Cup, did you come back often?
It happens.
You journalists keep me from forgetting that.
But I think it's bad for an athlete who lives on old victories, who keeps repeating his successes.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days, and we're moving on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season much different from what you're used to?
I can't say it was anything special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter racing season.
I trained at home in Barnaul, then at the gym, then at home again.
It's the same as usual.
But my coach and I set a challenge: to try and get to a new level that I hadn't been to before.
They spent almost the entire winter laying the foundation.
We ran a lot of cross country, did some general fitness exercises that included pulling, squatting, and back-pumping.
Then we started barrier training, doing a lot of engineering.
Watched the competition?
I always try to do that, and in the age of the Internet, there's no problem with that.
I saw the European Winter Championships, and the French took the podium in the hurdles.
I thought, "We should do something, dilute this company".
With every start this season, you've been adding and adding.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all my seasons run roughly the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I always twist my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
The whole work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is, you feel like you're ready for something, and it's not always the case that you're ready to compete.
Like at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - "NI") I tried to forget right away.
I was really good, I could run out in 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at that point, he would have won the bronze medal.
But not luck.
Remember your first World Cup?
How's that?
Tag was.
I really wanted to go to the finals, there was such a program.
And he fell off the grid in the preliminaries.
That's when I realized that to be torn and to be beaten is to be nowhere.
Two years later, at the world championship in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember how I felt before the decisive race: I wanted to win the gold!
How do you keep your head up at a decent speed and not lose it?
That's the hard part.
You have to be very careful, focused on the technique, so you don't fall into the barriers.
I've noticed that when you're focused on the process, not the outcome, it's much easier.
And the best part is when you feel like you're running away and everything just happens!
I swear, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the deep after their first major successes are looking to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
It's better at home.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been with Klevtsov?
Since I was 12, when I started athletics.
Actually, I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she passed me on.
I started with the sprint, then I jumped in the long jump, triple jump.
The kids' wrestling was when they throw the ball, jump in from the seat...
I tried hurdling when I was 14, and I loved it.
From the first run, I managed to meet the norm of the second adult class.
And it stayed that way.
You never had a fear of barriers?
I got a deal with them right away.
But the technology has always been a lot of work.
He was in so much pain over one run!
But there's no getting away from that routine.
I had to keep improving my technique, so that I could be woken up at night, and I would get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing says it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you, I'm all right.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my runs, and I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency is something that needs to be worked on - there is no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that winning the Olympics a year from now will be a heavy burden?
As they say in these cases, I'll try to live up to expectations.
If he's going down this road, he's going to go all the way.
My coach likes to say that if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra burden.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar of Kushanasvili
Well, I'm not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread, just throw in the enemy.
And while I didn't wave the flag, and I said the same thing a million times here, and I didn't call anybody a bastard, I was struck by something else.
All my fake friends disappeared in a flash.
The pressure I'm under is so strong that even I, seeing the looks of the boys, think the white people are fed up.
It's like you're walking, walking, and then you're attacked by a mob and you're muted with a stick.
But you know me, I'm not a rooming eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a hook, I'm old, you guys, to be afraid.
It's another thing to have no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best part about me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And only a moron can give passports to a freak like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather have a job that's not ashamed of me.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanachvili described the events in Crimea in a sharp way:
What you did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I'm guessing that the reference to the drunk Khrushchev trying to sign something doesn't fit into the general picture of a human dormitory.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his space...
The war is over from the Kremlin, and it's only going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some bastard behind the Kremlin wall.
I have a hunch who it might be...
The cobson doesn't have much of a life left.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why does he have to lick Putin's hands?
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his statue.
Of course, people remember him as an insult to his little country.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise leads the rankings despite Ninth's attempts to cover the loss of the leaders on the Today Show.
The arrival of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the leader's seat was unable to lift Today's ratings much.
The Ninth was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, with David Koch and Samantha Armitage as hosts, is stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture didn't seem to matter much to Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience of 397,000 in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its rankings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against Today's 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

The big news for Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children has amassed an impressive audience of 1.219 million.
Critics debated whether Thompson could handle the popular show on her own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a resounding yes.
The X Factor Seven remained strong with an audience of 1.136 million, easily overtaking The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For Seventh, it was a mix of luck and failure on the second night of the Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623 000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat's Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half hour drew a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night of ratings decline will force the Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which couldn't beat the McGwire show.

The three finalists all agree that "Single Sam Wood" is the perfect guy, but who will he pick?
The secret is out?
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snow Markosky may have accidentally given away who would win "Ballboy".
The woman who ends up with Sam Wood in "The Bachelor" is shrouded in secrecy.
And the three girls who made it to the finals, of course, are keeping quiet about who exactly got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when three girls were supposed to be two, they may have inadvertently given us a hint as to who the winner was.
Sam Wood is steadfastly silent until the final, which will be held on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" could have unintentionally indicated which of them had actually won the heart of the "Single".
Jevons-Fellowes and Marcoski were quick to call McKay the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy (of Sara) and the energy of Sam and I knew they were a great match, and throughout the show I didn't doubt that", Jevons-Fellowes said.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun", added Marcoski.
I saw them together, they really do have a thing for each other.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McKay herself said that she realized from last week's homecoming that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart", she says.
When asked who she should choose for Voodoo, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it", she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Channel Ten.

Jarrida Hayne had several options to start her NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the U.S. - as were many other clubs who sent in requests after an impressive open day of training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsull, and it seemed like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for a missed ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on his first punt return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the punt back, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving the newcomers a hand-off in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoway, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarred Hayne lost the ball on the Minnesota Vikings' punt return during the first quarter.
This was not the start Hein and his many Australian fans had expected for his NHL debut.
He was seen cursing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later told the host of the "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's it", said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the 2007 Origin series, when a ball in his own end zone brought a try to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Heine took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at a Siberian airport under threat of weapons use.
Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, his Yukos oil company was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
Migrants clashed with police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water spray and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to tear down the border fence.
Reinforcements have been sent to the scene, and police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to cross the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border in buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, BBC reports.
The authorities allowed the migrants to arrive in Croatia and ensure their transportation from there to the country of origin.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament is also planning to consider the transfer of border security functions to the Hungarian armed forces.
In late June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian has confessed to the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
Russian Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyberattack in U.S. history, has admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During a trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the defendants' actions was estimated at $300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security", U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said.
The drinker faces 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million.
When the court decides the verdict, it will take into account the Russian's confession and perhaps reduce his sentence.
The verdict will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time another suspect, Dmitry Smilanyets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies any responsibility for the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risks of Russia's support for the Assad regime.
During a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks deepening and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of fighting extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition", the statement said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed during the phone call that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition away from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation for supporting the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russian soldiers have been in Syria for years, helping Syrians learn the techniques to use against the Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police opened fire with rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where the Madezi people say the new provinces created under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among citizens of the Taru ethnic group who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
The agreement was signed on August 1 by the four major political parties to divide the country into provinces, a crucial step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers voted on the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, with officials saying the new chapter will be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a factory for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry center, has a developed infrastructure that requires systematic support.
A year ago, a new mayor was elected to lead the city, Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of "Obelstnaya" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valerievich, how did you start as mayor?
First of all, I have examined the results of the financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the spending of local budget funds.
Then a review of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document turnover to five days.
Previously, the papers could go for months.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize expenditures.
Last November, a visiting government meeting was held in Sayansk, where the issues of the territory's social and economic development were discussed.
There was no project-smet documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without that, Sajansk couldn't participate in federal programs.
We started with the road construction, kindergarten, northern sewer and water supply.
Road works are already underway at two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This is the most positive demographic the city has seen in 27 years.
So the issue of childcare facilities is one of the most pressing today.
From September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, which is designed for 320 seats, was closed for renovation.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after renovation, the kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which now attends 200 children.
The renovation was done on the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds were found to buy furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With this, we plan to eliminate the queue of children from the age of one and a half to three.
We don't have lines for kids three to seven.
Are investors interested in the property?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be done primarily by Sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-room orphanage in the Leningrad neighborhood is being put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities in the Angara region that has been included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation is ready.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
We have announced the construction of 10,000 square meters of housing. There are many people who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that the price of the housing should not be more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, and this price includes the "key to the door" finish.
If we can handle the volumes, we'll continue the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the territory was built by the Sayan pig complex, which in 2004 was sold for a price.
We're working with the D.A. to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of the land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the pig farm going up, we're gonna have 900 jobs, which is a big boost for the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have signed about 140 agreements on socio-economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
The company's management responds to all requests. The company's management is also very supportive of the company's activities.
Directly to the Day of the city, the "Sayan Broiler" LLC gave the city a children's town, the "Vostok-Center" firm repaired the horse yard, where specialists are engaged with children in ipatherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, the city's ZAGS was rebuilt.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the City Day in a colorful way.
As in the good old days, the parade was held with the participation of city groups and organizations.
The city's chronicle, the book of the Sayans poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with anniversary medals.
The patrons also participate in the city's charity fund.
The very first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over the past nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been spent on supporting talented children, children in need of expensive treatment, and children from low-income families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city is short on doctors and subject teachers.
Housing is of great importance for the personnel issue.
Last year we allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers got official housing.
We're running a housing program with the potential to privatize it in five years.
The plans are to re-plan the building, which will house eight more teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "House for Russian Family".
In the future, we'll build a house for the budget workers.
The most important thing is that there's a team in town that I can work with to solve the most difficult problems.
It's important to make the right decisions out of all the crises, and life doesn't stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill to index the social security contributions in view of the price increase.
The State Duma has introduced a bill that provides for indexation of social pensions every year from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from "Justice Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of the prices of goods and services.
According to the current legislation, the indexation of social pensions is carried out annually from April 1 taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the Russian Federation in the past year.
The bill introduced in the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second is held on 1 April.
The OSCE PA chief told Mogherini that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In an official letter to the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, the OSCE PA's spokesman, Ilka Kanerva, said sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly were unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator, Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, the European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have collected signatures in support of Canerva's position.
"A fairly strong support has already been formed", Kovalev said.
He previously stated that the OSCE PA head was speaking with the intention of collecting the signatures of the deputies, who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing structures and "send a petition".
NHC reports a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde.
The broad front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, Miami forecasters say.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a double-donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping overcrowded European countries with refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach by announcing a fundraising campaign on their blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We traveled by questionable trains and buses, enduring hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe intensifies, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said that it will double the first $5.5 million donation until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused in large part by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help diabetics who are slightly obese
The beneficial effects of obesity surgery on people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that people with mild obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who do not receive surgery.
"The death toll is not coming out right away", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in a column for JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to digest food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main research has been done on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, the measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal if it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and arm gastrectomy - with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with moderate obesity.
The average BMI of surgeons dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Of those who had surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially cured.
In the medicated group, for comparison, only about 1 percent of the patients were completely cured of diabetes, and only about 2 percent were partially cured.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors state.
The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
It is better to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected in good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, said study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, compared with the group that had completed a sleeve gastrectomy, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in BMI (by 7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was also closer to complete diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show any benefit of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery does lead to an increase in life expectancy, reports Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix.
A Swedish study found that for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the odds of dying within 15 years were about 29 percent lower than for the more traditional treatment group.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with BMI under 35 to be interested in the procedure.
"The report is very important here because it says that this surgery is safe in the low BMI group, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease", she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they've accumulated the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytishchy, the robbers took fur and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchy, robbers attacked a Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house on Gorky Street through an open door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three furs.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article "Razboi".
The fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the 2018 World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get the permits.
Experts say it's a very alarming sign.
In the run-up to the World Cup, the authorities will have to find a way to evacuate all the guests.
The Rosbalt interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, the rent will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, every hotel in St. Petersburg must go through a classification procedure and prove that it meets the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is now clear that not everyone can do this: hotel owners are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As head of the Federal Aviation Administration Vadim Vladimirov said, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly authorities.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies deceived the city, placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is, we're on the hook for literally every number, and we can't lose any of them before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all the hotels in St. Petersburg.
Now, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy of the Committee on Tourism Development, Nana Gvichi, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, in a surprising coincidence, does not know.
So there may be more people who have been classified, but no one knows.
"The last six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification", said Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of Tourist Industry.
This is because of the high season, when hoteliers make the most money and don't want to do anything else.
Another reason is the budget, which has not been guaranteed for the costs of checks, and the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But recently, hotel managers have become more active and have begun to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
The hotels have to be there by July 1, 2016, or they'll not only pay the fine, but they won't even get the right to work at the World Cup.
It's already known that depending on the star rating, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formula for the cost will be announced next year.
This is done to prevent the price of goods from rising by 200-300%, as happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not let them pay two or three times the price, but you have to let the hotels make money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%", explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing is in line with market economy.
I don't know how much of this fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justified.
"It's better than uncontrolled inflation", he said.
It's not clear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill that would ban hostels in residential buildings.
We really hope that this law will not be passed or will not affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved", says Nana Gvachia.
However, she said, mini-hotel owners should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code in any case.
If the State Duma approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and there are currently 1,500 rooms.
According to the president of the Northwest Restaurants and Hotels Federation, Leonid Garbar, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are just as popular with football fans, but there is a shift towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation when "75 thousand whip seats are in an 80-thousand-seater stadium".
That can be fixed by mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but the newcomers for some reason can't".
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if it's a hotel where guests stay for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup because of their lack of speed.
Hundreds of small hotels just don't make it through the classification, and they're digging a hole for themselves.
By summer 2016, all the hotels in the city will be ordering the work.
"There are not many companies that can do this, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive", Gennady Lamshin noted, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the tests are much higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is also due to the constant changes in the government's tourist block, which does not contribute to the harmonious work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, then you will probably have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300th anniversary celebrations of St. Petersburg could see the city mobilize the river fleet, meaning that guests of the tournament could live in cabins.
And many fans will arrive in vans that are equipped to sleep in.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so that they empty", - Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also, rental housing will be very popular during the football championship.
They're probably gonna create a reserve of rentals in the city.
Rent will rise by 10-30%.
"Obviously, the first to go is the housing near the stadium", said Larisa Bragina, a lease specialist at the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
And the rental price may not return to its previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport links in the outskirts of the city will also contribute to this, she stressed.
And we must not forget the human qualities of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people can not only give directions, but also take a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in the yard in 1970 - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to stay: hotels were difficult at the time, and it was difficult to sleep at the train station.
"And Dad took them to our communal apartment to sleep", recalled the interlocutor.
But he added that now such a devil in the city residents is not left - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we may have to recall the past?
Zhirinovsky "fused" the Amur region.
I was watching Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma today.
He did this stuff when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech is "LDPR protest against the results of the Amur region elections".
The LDPR has no protocols other than those signed by the electoral committees.
He's picking up the runner-up Ivan Abramov and yelling something like, "Here's the winner!"
And then, after a fight with the chairman, he drives the faction out of the meeting room, literally shouting "You all with fronts are your crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, is not focusing on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Wolfowitz really beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another "Podonki!"-style outburst by Zhirinovsky, not a political party protesting against the results of a particular election.
And the faction formally scandalised, and the election, according to the party website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly falling behind.
He allows the dead on Amur to bury their dead, and he preaches against "United Russia" in general and nothing to blame Rodnina.
A very elegant decision, not to lose face and not to go into a real scandal, not a show.
The other thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
He didn't expect anything but a scream from the top, no alternative protocols on hand.
He's not in the public eye, on the one hand, and on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he's the formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even more cool, the humorous attacks on the EP and the ONF.
And he's got to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the number two politician of the region and the number one candidate for the only one-mandate regional district, he can turn into a pariah, successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-exciter for the same ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
If it weren't for Zhirinovsky, he'd have to be invented and watched with respect.
Trump is gonna grow and grow.
There's news that the LDPR will be back in the room during the next plenary.
So the bathroom just fell out of nowhere.
Only, she buried the Abramov theme underneath her.
It's really beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion and Ethics Studies in Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the U.S. crackdown had triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush, telling him that the solution to this problem is nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it had unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
The number of children who have swallowed hand sanitizer has quadrupled in the last four years.
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase since 2010 in children under 12 years of age who ingest hand sanitizer with high alcohol content, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hand sanitizer fluids reported to the toxicology center increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are exposed to these substances more often, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquids on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap beverage.
The teenagers reportedly mixed the disinfectant with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him", Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the scent of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer fluid contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey bottle, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed about four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was speechless and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary", said Orthoria Scott, Naiji's mother, to CNN.
It could have been fatal to my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to keeping hand-disinfectant liquids out of children's reach.
Besides alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic unidentified ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their "opposing" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizers, and she has banned them from her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "bullshit talk", and are directing disciplinary action to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya, a cast-iron owl is saddened.
The kids who come for the books try to feed her candy.
Several generations have been going to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth century organized loud readings here, put on performances of poems by Mayakovsky, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote in 1939, with each passing day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent a childhood photo to her distant friends in Barnaul.
And when the Barnaulans asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being named after her, she wrote that she did not, she did not object.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of reconstruction, people often called, saying: "Why isn't the children's library renamed?"
Let's have a library named after a good children's author, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it at that.
Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, like Lenin's in Moscow.
There's a yellow brick pathway on the floor in the library lobby.
"The Wizard of Emerald City" is a favorite theme of artist Oli Moskowski.
Olya used to be a manager at a law firm, she came to work at eight, left at five, and the only difference between her and the other managers was her love for drawing.
And then I found an ad online saying, "We need an illustrator for a book".
It was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy".
Olya was doing illustrations, and she thought, "Life can end at any moment, and there's no miracle in it unless you create it yourself".
She now works in a library, illustrating children's books by writers from around the world and writing her own stories.
It's traditionally believed that children are losing interest in books, that they're increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says the director of the library Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the children are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large display window with a renewed photo exhibition.
Every quarter, new photographs are posted of readers going to the library with their families: mom, dad and kids.
The library is happy that dads are coming with their kids more often.
If at two years old a child has read all of Chukovsky, at a much older age he needs more complicated books.
But now there's a law that says an eight-year-old prodigy can't give out 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents with him - they come, they come back again, and gradually the Big Room becomes a kind of family club for them.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of herbs with goats and ears, a story by Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", a sewing of "Murzilki" for 1936.
We are not just a conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a workplace, not a school", explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to our house and read, play, paint.
We made a playground for the little ones, and the kid just comes in and plays, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they're stuck, they don't want to leave.
Moms often come with wheelchairs, and we're glad they're putting the library first among all the other places to come with their babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: "Today's children, just like we once did, love classical children's literature:
"Publishing is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors as a link between generations".
And when it comes to young children, it's important to them that there's some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, telling what is happening in modern children's literature, which books to look for and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
That's a magic privilege only children have.
...in the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, to the bookstore.
The steps will be scraping under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend: hey, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie is still walking the yellow brick road, the lazy Tola Ryzhikov is stealing the magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish has never told the damned bourgeois the Military Secret - that's his word.
Books like this are like passwords, you can read them anywhere.
There are also rare books in the warehouse, such as a pre-revolutionary collection of herbs with goats and ears.
Or the Queen in the famous Niva magazine app.
Or the 1936 sewing of the Mourning.
Time has aged the pages, painted them tea-colored.
These publications are no longer available to the public.
These are the pieces of our future collection, and I'm always dreaming of retiring and doing rare children's books.
But kids don't like it anymore, so to speak. The colors in old books aren't very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now I wonder why we were all writing this "Pioneer Truth" thing.
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, the head of the bookstore.
The pages of The Twilight Zone have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been the head of the bookstore all her life.
She knows what color Buratino's caps are, what school year Harry Potter captained Gryffindor's Quidditch team, what situations Carlson uses a motorcycle muffler in, and who Alice Selezneva's father works for.
The job of librarian is low-paying, and anyone who can live without these rows of books quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, book worshipers.
They can also be identified by their smile, which is considered a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you the first minute you talked, he's a professional.
I like children's books in general: as a librarian I like them to be smooth and beautiful on the shelves, and I love reading them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical novels, fairy tales, fiction. I read all kinds of books, including the best of the best.
I read modern Russian authors, recent translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me at the time.
And because I loved them so much, I thought a library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope books will always be there, despite the readers.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring their children, or even their grandchildren...
There are no differences at Celtic.
Griffiths denied any talk of Celtic disagreement after Dale admitted the Hoops were in a bad place, but he's fixing it.
The Hearts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons have increased their lead over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to drop five points from Celtic.
Griffiths denied any talk of disagreement.
This sparked rumors of disagreements at Celtic, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who stated that he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism as they prepared for a meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't in the title race.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Burr has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now a representative of Ajax, said: "The Dutch no longer show the most attractive aspects of Celtic's games, and why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see the games.
"I'm going to betray everything", said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admits Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian coach vows to change things.
After the defeat by Malmö and the resulting exit from the Champions League, 10 players lost to Aberdeen, who now, having lost by five points, are in the top row of the table.
However, Dale stated, "Selita has had bad times before, and we're going out again".
We want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support, because that's what makes the players so much better.
It's so important to stay together right now.
Warburton is looking forward to January transfers .
Despite the opinion that emerged just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he had identified some of the goals of the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is skeptical of the January campaign, claiming he doesn't want to disrupt the team's unity.
The former Brentford striker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt, which you saw in our own squad this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
The player who's in the Celtic's interest has hinted at the end of his career.
Swansea striker Mitch, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may leave football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Hearts are going to confront the SFA over the claims of Neilson.
The Hearts led 2-1 after the loss of Patterson, and began to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later revoked; this is Colum's third red card canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not back down, saying, "I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game".
Griffiths has sworn to avoid Tyncastle .
The hard-core Hibernian player got a kickback after admitting to singing a song that insulted former Hearts player Rudy Scatel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a burn", the striker said, adding: "I can say with certainty that I wasn't going to return to Tyncastle unless he plays for Celtic.
The Tannadis board is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the guys ready to go out again", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy that the Ugly won against Hamilton.
Derek MacInnes admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assists to win their seventh consecutive league title, which put them five points above Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said, "There's no team here that won anything, a cup, or a league championship, that didn't win games in this way".
Unemployment rates in Scotland remain unchanged, while in the UK as a whole they are rising.
SCOTTLAND'S unemployment remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people out of work in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than the United Kingdom's 5.5%, as shown by figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of people in employment now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Minister for Home Affairs David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy".
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the last 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market in Scotland with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I'm a witness to an Oklahoma execution
Today, avoiding late-stage legal action, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, which I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the death row gallery at Oklahoma State Prison as Richard Glossop is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made was back in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend funerals in America, and because there are often more people than seats, the results of a grim lottery decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma's cut the number of press seats from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be looking at this without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've developed our own relationship after months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
That's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still thinks I'm doing the wrong thing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to report on it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Belver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of accessory to murder.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure the evidence was insufficient to convict him.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'm going to be entirely objective.
There'll be other reporters you can reach out to.
I'll show you what it's like to watch someone I care about die unnecessarily.
The man being chased by the police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River .
A constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to climb out of the Canning River and stay dry.
A Perth resident tried to escape from police but was unable to, being stuck in the dirty water on a shallow water a few yards from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to come ashore".
Canning Vale Police were called Tuesday for trespassing in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away by jumping into Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not coming out, come on, catch me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandle Casldane.
Constable Lachlan Perhavets didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he used a safer tactic - "negotiate with a good cop".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape", says Sergeant Major Kasldin.
That's what Ben Cousins, the champion football player, remembers.
In 2006, Cousins moved to a cove to avoid meeting a police patrol for a liquor check, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but they prompted local residents to invent the humorous "Ben Cousins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from horse racing
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to install a spy in his stable last year and threatened to quit the sport immediately.
His target was the stewards and ethics staff of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organising a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatay from the race for a drug violation on the day of the race, Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always does his best in racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to testing positive for Lidar's cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He's been keeping his mouth shut about the espionage suspicions for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like a green grape".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been putting up with it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of control that you can't control yourself", Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking that's not the case, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Moody had previously made a sensational claim during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll name if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I do in my stable", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all file a report, since they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, current CEO of RVL, knew this all along and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what happens in this business, other than the coaches?
Am I bad for this job?
Am I that bad for the job?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I'm sure what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I'm going to put pressure on them and make them responsible for making decisions.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari cases, and the latest horse pulling from the start made him declare that he could "throw his license on the table".
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the requirement for medical supplements on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a race violation.
"I must take full responsibility for this", he declared.
One of my employees accidentally put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten the compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it were.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules governing the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for using the compress, which has prompted an investigation by the flight attendants.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the scene in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was flown by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to assist and other traffic violations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is defending himself against accusations of violent tactics.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the interception of the ball "an imposition of the agenda" by the two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm to "fight" his team during the Storm's surprise win in the final of the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to the Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament against the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and said two of the Queensland team were not "very successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team's interception and stated that they were simply focused on "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team from the two top coaches, as it meant they were worried about a possible loss to the Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the hard-hitting when they beat us 24:2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, just that over the last six weeks we've been focusing on the contact in the interception, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how it always shows up this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George-Illavarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was", Bellamy noted.
I remember back in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers to be impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football his way -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things, because they're a little bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Roosters game was a more point-winning contest than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it, but what was the score?
In our game, he was 20-18, two more tries, and what, that's impressive football?
Or do you find the breaks and the failures impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we might meet them there.
The Storm have a weekend off this weekend, as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
The Serb accused of drug possession was released on $ 200,000 bail .
A man facing life in prison for attempting to smuggle 40 kilos of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay, a yacht coming from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Kumera in August.
All morning long, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is facing life imprisonment for attempting to appropriate narcotic substances in quantities sufficient to sell, Maximovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to obtain the entire batch, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich was worth letting out on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint $200,000 bail for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them", Judge Flanagan observed.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to go free on bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, be marked in the police force daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the Greek team that fought until the last seconds".
Greece head coach Fotis Kacicaris has given credit to his team after the EuroBasket 2015 quarter-final match with Spain (71:73).
He said the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game, " quotes AFP from Katzikaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish performance.
We tried to work on the defense, but the defense's mistakes determined the fate of the game.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned the Kaun functions at CSKA".
The newest member of the Central Intelligence Agency, Joel Freeland, has declared that he doesn't believe in the army curse.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club would break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland - "In fact, I will be assigned the role of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive structures and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, it's gonna take me a while to get back to center, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now I'm gonna have to do a lot more against a big center fielder, but I've done this before, so I think I'll do it.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
They've made the Final Four six times since then, but they haven't been able to put their best basketball on the field every time.
There's a rumor that the team was set up.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, and I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious person, and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, that if you combine those two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match against Roma will be special".
The head coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with "Roma" with special feelings.
According to the coach, the face-off between his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the "wolves" in the 2011/12 season, but failed to prove himself in the best way in the capital of Italy.
"I came back to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience", Luis Enrique said, according to UEFA's official website.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with a win.
August's meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup won't affect the teams' actions in the next match.
I expect Roma to play the game they showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It's a strong team, they know how to press and they know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has various variants of the attack.
The acting head coach of the "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko in the run-up to the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the diversity of attacking schemes of the team of the opponent.
According to the coach, the Bulls have several offensive game models in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
We'll see how we play Krasnodar, - the official website of the Ural quotes Skripchenko.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different offensive options, it does a lot of different offensive things, and we're not a slow team, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, considering that Krasnodar is hosting a Europa League match against Dortmund's Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
"Astana's home can take away points from anyone".
"Astana" midfielder Roher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with "Benfica" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Haasbek, the Astana team can take points from any opponent on their field.
Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official UEFA website from the words of Kanyas. - We lacked a little courage in the attack.
Benfica are a class above, but at home, I think we can count on them to score points.
It's very real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaray, and then you have to think about Atletico.
We can take points from anybody at home.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll say it again and again: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the big win in the Champions League group stage match with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, Benitez said, according to UEFA's official website.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks always carry danger.
I'm not saying Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of chances to score.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it as many times as I want.
Giorgio Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo is not like Messi".
Barcelona defender Giorgio Alba believes that no one can compare himself to Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real's forward Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
"Messi is five points above the rest", Le Figaro quotes Alba. "No one can do what Leo can do.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo, he was a good guy.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group match against Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
As a reminder, the C.E. will be doing a live broadcast of the event.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with excellent players, - quotes the official website of UEFA De Rossi. -
The blue garnet is difficult to play with, for it has not only a unique style but also a distinctive personality.
To keep them, we'll have to keep on plowing the whole game and backing each other up.
Messi is almost always successful when he goes around, so we need to stay compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to be in the starting lineup in the match with "Slovano".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov came on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen at the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and returned all the shots to his own goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The team will play the next match on the road against "Slovana".
I hope that I will be in the starting lineup in the next match, - quotes "R-Sport" Yezhov.
I'm not a goalie expert, I'm a goalie myself, and we don't show repeat goals, so it's hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarzhoova was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhoova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
The Czech tennis player is currently in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the return of the finalist of Roland Garros-2015 is not yet known.
We'll also remind you that on Monday, Shafarjova climbed one place in the WTA rankings and is now the fifth best female rocket in the world.
Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged into an Internet messaging service, and received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked it and found shocking photos, which she immediately brought to her mother's attention.
The police came and saw five images, then they searched the computers found at that address, and found "corresponding" search queries using words to find indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police he did it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a cop to scare them off".
Authoritative bailiff Eileen Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making computer searches, but claimed it was because he wanted to impersonate a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and about him asking to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them in.
He said he had a head problem when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl discovered the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then the defendant was engaged in a face-to-face bet.
The girl was questioned and reported that the defendant used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear for the hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant's attorney, Gregor Sim, petitioned to have Hogg removed from the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it could be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October, pending a review by social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before the other remaining cases could be heard.
He was listed as a sex offender before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is giving the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell off a podium earlier this year.
He was not hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling at Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they whistled at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; that's exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonez, a member of parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warned the distinguished members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity is no longer in effect.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service-sharing program.
That same year, Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies, separating the manufacturing of computers and printers from the more rapidly growing sectors of hardware and service operations.
The estimated job losses will be approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing previously unattainable comprehensive technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is the story of a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is the latest development in the industry, based on the belief that specialized companies do better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his teammates should be supporting the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, he would be back in action by Christmas.
With the best of odds, Wilshire will miss at least four of his next England games and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most offensive thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire had confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
"This injury is not a threat to his career".
It's just not a completely healed bone.
It's not a big deal.
It was just a coincidence.
It's not related to his ankles or any injuries he's had before.
It could be related stuff from a medical standpoint, but as Wenger also admitted, there's an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
He has also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting with 2007-08, Arsenal were one of the two Premier League clubs to have the most missed days due to injury.
Wenger admits he may be stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury statistics will continue this season.
"Sometimes, when you're back from an injury, you're vulnerable for a while - that's when you need to rebuild and gain a competitive edge", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of that, and I'm sure his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with a game against Chelsea and the following Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur, with Wenger intending to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that the starting line-up will be played by Matteo Debussy and Arteta.
Wenger may also bring in Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little break to the players who need it", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the absolute favourites in Group F, the "Maksimir" stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost a single game in 41 seasons since they managed to spend last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive", Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially when you consider how desperate men's need for honesty has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Living has declared 2015 the Year of Men, in an effort to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take up this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students who had symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a large enough number of friends who were "in a normal mood", the chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, having a healthy circle of friends halves the chance of developing a mental disorder.
But of course, for a friendship to work, it has to be.
In an age where communication is driven by social media, where style prefers content, the speed of a response is often valued more than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when the reality is lonely.
This superficial success is driven by what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of inner values, our inner drive for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire video game developer recently noted, money can't really buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not by their work, but rather by the personality that was manifested in their interactions with their friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's sigh over Rachel - it all comes from the realization that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one Samaritan employee told me, "...my role as a listener for people who are experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts highlights how even the slightest interaction with friends can be beneficial".
Often, the men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "live with it" teaching is as strong as the feeling that talking about problems openly can be perceived as weakness".
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to suggest more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle aspects of male friendship.
As for my job, the status of a stranger on the phone helps people in their moments of despair, and the long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you're going to the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the party's completely restored, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say, "Hello".
You can't predict what a friendship will do.
Friends is airing on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, under the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal to help PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria is on par with Blaise Mathewdi and Edinson Cavani celebrating the goals scored in the Malmö goal.
Angel di Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored a goal, allowing PSG to easily overtake Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their part as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the course for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed to get off to a good start against the defending champions Sweden, as they were aiming not for a playoff qualification, but for a continuation of the successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give the opponents problems and to play well in defence is a good start, even if there are still points we need to work on during the season", Blanc said.
It's very promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the substitutions for the Paris team, which brought them a 2-2 draw in the match against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was sent back to the back of the grid by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to the next level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran a pass from Marco Verratti behind the Malmö defence and finishing the attack beautifully by sending a ball from Yo Villand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two central midfielders, were a serious opponent.
But, except for Nikola Djurjic's shot, which flew past Kevin Trapp's long bar in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
However, PSG sometimes disappointed itself with unsuccessful passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not make at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved much more adept at accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a curve kick, which went in-pitch to the batting line past Viland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after the clock was ticked thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimovic corrected a ball sent into the centre of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had about returning to the game, and only a close interception by Villand prevented David Luis from raising the final score before Esekiele Lavessi, who had been substituted, scored the match's last goal.
Malme manager Aage Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not that level.
Qualification is not enough.
Praise the Paris!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore is making $2.5 billion from the sale of stock.
Glencore, a Swiss-based mining and trading giant hit by the fall in commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its grand debt-reduction plan.
Glencore, a London-listed company, has announced that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore's stock price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69 percent higher when it opened.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion in stock as part of a sweeping plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold the new shares at 125 cents a share, or 2.4 percent off the closing price on Tuesday.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company's authorized capital.
Fears of a continued slump in the Chinese economy have led to the price of iron ore falling by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in an official statement Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be making an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit - Xi Jinping's first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan for a government dinner the same evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on common, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, and will allow the U.S. and Chinese presidents to constructively approach the consideration of controversial issues", the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington, and then travel to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns over alleged Chinese cyber espionage and China's growing categoricism over the disputed South China Sea.
The man who hit the biker at the Kutuzovsky funfair got two years in the colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims against Denny Mirzoev for the sum of 1.2 million rubles.
Moscow's Dorogomilovsky court has sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in a settlement colony.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of the rules of traffic and use of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims for the sum of 1.2 million rubles.
During the parties' arguments, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoev to three years in prison and to recover from him the victims' claims in full amount - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three o'clock in the morning in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
A BMW car, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the traffic lane and hit a motorcyclist who was standing on the side of the road.
The man, born in 1989, died at the scene.
Friends of the victim on social media reported that the BMW driver was speeding and had driven into the opposite lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Vorobyov mountains to the building of the Moscow State Police on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation had detained the suspected perpetrator of the accident.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal actions, the police handed him over to the doctors for urgent psychiatric care.
Police officers in Moscow detained a man who entered a church without clothes.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
According to the head of the press service of the Moscow Ministry of Internal Affairs Andrey Galiakberov, the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, around 16.00, on the Kashir highway.
A naked man entered the church of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did nothing illegal.
A police squad arrived on the scene.
Law enforcement officers waited for the emergency psychiatric team to come and hand the man over.
He was a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at the meeting of the regional government presidium.
Part of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, the funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhny Novgorod district, for the capital repair of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will go towards the completion of the major renovation of the second floor of the therapeutic ward.
The hot and cold water supply, drainage, electrical and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a complex of fire safety and energy saving measures will be implemented.
The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will take place in Sochi, which will be attended by the Tyumen delegation led by the governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate results of cooperation are told by the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugla, who is part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the goals of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union state.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links in the relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and section meetings will discuss the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, on the normative and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The Tyumen region governor will speak at the forum.
I think this is a testament to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including those from the Tyumen region.
I hope the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar under the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen also shows the importance of our work.
In addition, the delegation of the Tyumen region's agricultural cooperative visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, to determine additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You met with the head of the region and the head of the city.
What were the topics discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult conditions was discussed.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be discussed - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trade house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The questions are important, because investment projects must work clearly and bring profits to the region.
It was said about further deliveries of passenger-load equipment of OAO "MAZ", development of the service center of OAO "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OAO "TPATP".
The talks also touched on the preparation of the working delegation of the region's visit to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
So the dynamics of relationships are promising to take us to a new level.
These issues also affected the regional centre.
During the meeting with the head of the Tyumen city administration, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renovation of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on gas, environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen lift factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products, OJSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
I think this activity could be intensified by the new elevator program in the regional center.
I would like to add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting took place with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing the trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment to the Ural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is planned for late September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are important and good because they allow many problems to be solved directly and quickly, reducing their acuity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it's critical to keep the momentum going and keep working for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnicity was not a factor.
During the Sunday broadcast of the HBO show Project Greenlight, Brown was interrupted by a well-known actor as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the lead black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the movie itself, not the show", Damon insisted.
Stunned, Brown could not believe her ears, and she was offended, exclaiming, "Wow!
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the Harmony image they are going to follow", Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who's being beaten up by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was strongly against it, saying "we may not end up getting what we want".
After the debate was televised, social media exploded with disapproval comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video, saying, "Matt Damon's explanation of diversity to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE, it hurts".
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's thorough coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the public agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained traction across the country, calling on lawmakers and government agencies to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, Prince mentioned the movement during the presentation of the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to Fox News contributor Elizabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love", the leaders of the movement said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior is awarding the first champion
Professional rock climber and waitress Isaac Calderón became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
At this sports show, which has just completed its 7th season, none of the contestants have yet managed to pass all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, two contestants - Calderón and operator Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and set the time, becoming the first athlete in American Ninja Warrior history to pass the grueling Stage 4, but Caldero was only three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After his hard-fought victory, Caldero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, because I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! about the huge jump in his income.
And then, suddenly... I never even imagined what it was like... the future was unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with reporters from The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to cross the track, won't receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest runner.
"If there is more than one finisher, the prize goes to the fastest", said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it is still a source of great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's happy with what he did.
It got tons of rave reviews from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I'm destined to lose to anyone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly outpacing the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season hasn't been particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central Division.
Just pretending to be a hindrance, the Tigers won Tuesday night with a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut their half-game lead over the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs in points behind the winners.
For Detroit, even for one night, it was a return to the F word that had eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they come out", said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to the offense, leading Detroit to three in the first two innings, then one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and gave up three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the year on a high note", Simon said.
Replacement pitchers can't throw every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The Tigers' designated hitter Victor Martinez managed to hit three home runs and two RBI's - his first since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit day since the four-hit game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did a good job with the bat", said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of a batter), noticeably better in batting and kept that quality for the game.
With three hits in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins have their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double to the left of the field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks made a punt to take first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a strikeout on a hit from Simon before his spot was taken by left fielder Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Moyer, the only player on the road, before newly-appointed kicker Miguel Sano, who hit a two-run single to the left of right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of out-runners and a comparative injury at second base, Verhagen managed to get third baseman Trevor Plouff to a double-play knockout.
It was the 27th time for a major league player this season that Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit added a safety in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned an RBI with a double in the outfield against the Tigers' closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, making the score 5-4.
However, the right-hander knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three runs in the first two innings against an outstanding pitcher who was on the injured list before the game, missing more than a month with a low back.
"It was definitely not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning".
After the first baseman reached first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wouk, with two outs from right fielder J. D. Martinez, pulled out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first shot of the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series 0 for 21 with the runners in a resulting position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single, inflicting another injury, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a one-hit double from catcher James McCann and a two-hit single from center fielder Anthony Goose, and it was 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit right.
Hughes, whose shots were counted, threw in the scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed reliever A. J. Achter.
Hughes had three hits in six at bats and walked four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Aníbal Sánchez has been ruled out due to a right shoulder sprain.
He's going to be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and face the Twins.
Norris, who has made four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has a record of 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not competed since August 20 due to a sprained ankle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov's complaint on the book "Please to God" was sent to the South Sakhalin court.
The South Sakhalin city court received the original appeal of the representative of the president of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, on the decision to recognize "extremist material" the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhrai.
The court is now awaiting any possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense", he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material".
The South Sakhalinsk prosecutor's office received an appeal on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made a wrong decision", Chuchrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotations from the Quran - "Thou alone we worship and Thou alone we seek help", "So call not upon anyone besides Allah" - were called "extremist".
Kadyrov called those who made the book's decisions "satan and provocateurs".
He urged the State Duma deputies to legislatively ban court decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law that prohibits the taking of decisions in court regarding the text of the Koran and other divine scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
The Facebook leadership is working with the German Justice Ministry to combat xenophobia and racism on the Internet.
Earlier, the department's head, Heiko Maas, said that the Justice Ministry is currently working with social network experts to create a special group of moderators.
Its members are obliged to track and delete comments that are incorrect about migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their recording.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also help to block illegal content.
The Facebook administration intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that contain negative comments about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's leadership and the German Justice Ministry after xenophobic sentiments surged in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that hit the European Union some time ago.
For example, all the refugee shelters in Germany are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities decided to temporarily settle the migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks that housed Nazi prisoners and prisoners of war.
Moscow cemeteries will have relaxation areas.
In the near future, several of the capital's cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first ones will be the Butovskaya, Domodedovo, and the Shcherby cemetery.
The first psychological rest area has already appeared at the Troyecurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will be established in other areas of the city.
This was told to m24.ru portal by Artem Yekimov, who is the head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small, park-like areas.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to cemeteries can rest, be alone with themselves, and recover psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the "Ritual" State Bank, if the need arises to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest masses in the maximum possible volume.
The green plantations will serve as a living fence that will separate the recreation areas from the areas set aside directly for burial.
The experts of the "Ritual" State Security Unit also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the fencing of burial grounds.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the "Ritual" State Dental Unit announced that it is ready to install electronic terminals that will allow visitors to find out the GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
For example, digging a grave in summer will cost a thousand rubles less, weeks in winter, when the earth is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, the cost of all types of ritual services has increased by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the Elnin forest.
The old man was alive, although he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
The mountain-mushroom was discovered thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest".
No food or water.
He was being sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
They even had a dog movie, but it didn't work.
The man was located after a helicopter was attached to the search.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich went to the forest as usual to get the oats and the cherry trees, but he did not return by evening.
The next day, rescuers and the indifferent residents of the nearby village - only about 30 people - were called in to search for the mushroom.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter from the fire and rescue center.
Andrei Seletsov, chief of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk region Fire and Rescue Center, said: "The helicopter was recovered, the man was found".
He's gone far away, somewhere else entirely.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search.
He's come a long way at his age.
It's a miracle he survived.
Gribnik was taken to the Elnin Central District Hospital unconscious, in a very serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypercoolidation.
How an elderly man survived five days in the woods is beyond the doctors' comprehension.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Helsinki Central Hospital: "The patient is scheduled for examination, treatment".
Infusion therapy, antibacterial, and so on.
Considering all his chronic conditions.
The patient's condition improved this morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Every year, a pensioner named Vitali Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to gather mushrooms before, but he had never gone far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not local in principle".
I've been coming here for a few years, visiting relatives.
Well, I went for mushrooms.
He must have gone too far and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Five cases in the last few days.
Rescuers remind you to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and a compass.
It is also desirable to leave traces behind so that you can return to them.
The emergency An-2 is sitting in the fraternal taiga.
An An-2 crashed in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisey" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
No casualties, but the plane itself sustained significant damage during landing.
An-2 was on a business flight.
Three crew members were on board - the commander, the second pilot and the flight engineer, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft was flying on the route of Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsk - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Fraternal Transportation Prosecutor's Office has begun checking compliance with the flight safety legislation after the An-2 crash landing.
The East Siberian Transportation Prosecutor's office has arrived.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed its passenger aircraft due to a technical malfunction at the abandoned tail airfield in Komi.
The aircraft's engines and onboard electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
The plane was carrying 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was hurt during the emergency landing.
The economy is a global issue.
The processes of globalization were supposed to reduce inequality in the world.
The reality is that the income gap in the developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin. What are you doing?
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, chief research officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions at the Higher Education University of the Czech Republic, and 2007 Nobel Prize winner in economics.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth of global markets.
Trade between the countries was becoming more and more open.
The proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true", Maskin points out.
China and India, for example, have seen significant growth in GDP per capita.
But it's not all that good.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in poor countries, which is reflected in the great inequality of income, or more precisely, in wages.
But in fact, inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Failed to Reduce Inequality in Emerging Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by the HSE.
Eric Maskin, in collaboration with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer, has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income gaps in poor countries are widening as globalization increases, according to the HSE Research Institute.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate this, Maskin sets out four levels of expertise -- A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of skills to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if the C-level workers in poor countries are getting higher because of cooperation with B-level workers in rich countries, then the D-level workers are either not getting any more or their wages are falling.
The bottom line is that internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of workers in poor countries and, consequently, increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin propose a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality", says Fuad Aleskerov, associate professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Making, head of the mathematics department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the researchers note that the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and the companies do not have the means to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role in this situation, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not call for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bringing its fruits in the form of the growth of the GDP of countries.
A living connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating its 2000th anniversary this September.
The program of the festivities includes the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Open Churches Day, the historical-musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and palace gardens - all of this is as if taken from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khanate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plantain trees growing in the courtyard of the Derbent Jama-mosque is several centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shade of the sprawling crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be served with aromatic tea and will be served with Dagestan delicacies - honey fig, hummus, mushroom, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, large samovars have been used for centuries to make tea for many guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Jumma mosque says that the building was built in the year 115 Hijri.
That's 733 in the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is impressive in scale and solemnity: the arcades of the domes and vaults are supported by square columns and illuminated by the sun's rays from tiny windows.
The keeping and breeding of pigeons is a traditional pastime of the people of Derbent.
The owners of domestic birds put pigeonholes in their yards, under trees, in attics.
The thrilling sight is the flight of a flock of white doves, which resemble the flashes of a festive firework.
In order to protect themselves from the enemy, the ancient Persians built a double stone wall around the Caspian Gate.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure closed the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets were woven in Derbent as early as the fifth century C.E., and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for all tastes - strips of wool, cotton, or silk of all colors and shades, with or without a warp, with intricate ornamentation and a fanciful rim.
The city was built from the beginnings of the maghals, one-story stone buildings.
The maggots have hardly changed in years.
Just the satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern one.
In the old part of the city, details of a water pipe built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
The ancient springs, from which the local people still draw water, have survived to the present day.
Many Derbent people prefer water from historic wells to ordinary tap water.
Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Watered and painted vases, dishes, pots, and cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
Potters still make wonderful ceramic objects for practical and souvenir use.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a stretched rope, on which the pupils of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of this amazing and risky craft goes back several centuries.
The new trend is that we're seeing more and more girls in the rope-walking community.
In the premises of the former Virgin Bath, the Museum of Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent is now open.
In the past, unmarried girls and brides were accompanied by their friends to bathe here, but now anyone can see the vaulted-dome hall, hot and cold pools, which are gone into the past with the bathing equipment.
Most homes in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of steam heating are written in ancient books.
After bathing, blood flow improves, muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes more flexible and light.
The festival "Sodruzhstvo", which takes place in the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethno-housemates from many districts of Dagestan.
The participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the Caucasus peoples and treat the visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowing sarcophagi are carved from solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubows cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barber shop has been here for years.
The techniques of the craftsman's crafts are passed down from generation to generation.
The Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house in which the exiled writer-Decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived has been preserved.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described the Derbent of the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and life of the city's inhabitants.
The teahouse is a traditional Eastern club, serving only tea and homemade pastries.
Men come here to quench their thirst, to talk to their friends, to solve some work problems.
As in the old days, women are not allowed to cross the teahouse threshold.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already had time to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The ensemble's soloists rehearse every day, perfecting the folk dances of the Avars, the Dargas, the Tatars, and the Armenians.
As the evening approaches, when the noise subsides and street lamps are lit, locals sit at stalls near houses with protruding terraces.
Usually, the Derbent discusses the issues of the day.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of their city's unique history that influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodedovo has a business game at the airport.
They're trying out a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
For this purpose, three airports were installed in Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced the planes.
It was all in the form of a business game, but it was no less complex than reality.
Flights are late, two passengers with fractures on board, the runway's lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
Hell for the real airport.
For someone who's settled in the Domodedovo hangar, it's a standard set of tasks for newcomers to solve.
One hangar could accommodate three major airports from different countries.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of the airfield.
They were entrusted with the registration of passengers, the servicing of planes, the handling of luggage - even the buses at the airfield, the runways and the inspection of passengers.
And the passengers are a problem.
One has a paperwork problem, another missed a flight, a third filled a bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it like you do in life, in the shortest possible time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amount for the flight service.
"They are fined for not doing their job", explains financial analyst Dmitry Hilko in an interview with the "Vesti-Moscow" program.
The Ministry of Education is closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She's already got a place in the vocational high school.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment", - says the director of the department of state policy in the field of training of working personnel and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia Natalia Zolotareva.
But students don't like global plans.
After three days of training like this, they're gonna need a day off.
But the grades on that exam were quite material.
The latest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to a complaint about our airport on Instagram in a timely manner", said the participant, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, as they say, are hired to work for them when they graduate.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the M.I. Rudominov All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of our countries' relations", said John Teft, the U.S. ambassador to Russia.
The American Center has created deep and lasting ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place for many prominent American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
"Just last year, the American center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50 thousand Russian visitors", the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
A typical situation: four officials stand at the desk of Judge Swatantar Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is not at all satisfied with the quality of your work.
"We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of", says Kumar.
If one more brick is laid, we'll order all existing buildings to be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial body set up in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the economic boom of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has handled more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste, and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop construction that leads to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in less than 60 years since independence, India has gone from a jungle country to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development is not catching up with rapid urbanization: cities are covered in dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for new housing developments.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government as it often becomes the main reason for cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes it is impossible to execute court decisions within the time limit set by the court, environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani confirms.
But there's a positive side to unreachable deadlines: At least they get the responsible people moving.
"His main goal is to shake up the system", the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects: it has stopped the construction of an airport, a power station and hundreds of smaller buildings.
People are also being considered, for example, when discussing the fate of a drug company in Telangana state that contaminated a local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are far from always understandable to ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of the judge's pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years old from entering the capital, which caused a public outcry.
Despite the sharp drop in popularity and the barrage of criticism, Swatantar Kumar refused to overturn this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on incoming and outgoing vehicles from the Delhi government, and also proposed purchasing 10,000 additional buses, having previously checked with the factories to see if they were able to fulfill the order.
As the courts began to focus on sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic accidents, the public's anger began to ease.
But the most sickening topic of the judge's ruling was the cleanup of the Ganges, announced with great pomp by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often loses his temper and starts screaming.
Do you know what the word "saint" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and it turned out to be feces, the judge warms up.
You keep polluting the river because you think, "The Ganges is the Ganges, it will take away all our sins".
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clean-up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the norm.
Each year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus who bathe there die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated the proceeds from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama, and 455 other items from his personal collection to the Ganga Rescue Fund.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while the river cleaning requires at least eight billion.
Green Tribunal supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that progress should be at the expense of the environment.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often viewed as an unconscionable luxury", says Call of the Gang activist Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development".
A man bleeds several of Dalí's paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists exhibition in Riga broke the windows in the museum and ruined Salvador Dali's sculpture "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum is currently hosting an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He was driving badly, ruining the sculpture, smashing the windows.
Then he started to move around the premises and stained several works of permanent exhibition with blood.
Among them is a portrait of the Brush Hand of Mirvaldis Polis.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobychin, to whom Interfax refers, the showcases were also damaged.
Police and art experts are on the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case has been filed against the man for hooliganism.
The Latvian Union of Artists hosts an exhibition of Picasso and Dali's works from August 4 to September 27, featuring more than 200 original works by the artists.

Xi calls for opening up the economy to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to stimulate growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to the task force on reform leadership.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open-door policy", he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to the market, changing the rules on border control, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and reviewing the system of registration of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually repaired through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring legality in business and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers it grants to companies, thereby ensuring that companies will run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be open to private investors to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions", the statement said.
The application process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or "green cards", will be further simplified by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunsheng and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
