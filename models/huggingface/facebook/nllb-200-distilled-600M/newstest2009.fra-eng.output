The Prague stock exchange was down to negative at the end of the trading
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange recovered its losses.
The transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange was rebounded with its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the drop is due to the fall in Wall Street stock.
The market reaction to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is thus also felt in our country.
The fall in stocks in Asia
The Asian stock market fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indices managed to erase some losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the drop to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange was down more than five percent, but it was finally able to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world", observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should resume negotiations soon and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected.
The bloodshed of American stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support bill, which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kč).
The legislators thus rejected the call for support for President George Bush's bill.
According to Bush, the project should address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
US stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday and the main stock indexes were in the worst decline in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, having seen a fall of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gave in: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to a vote early next week.
The US legislature made a decisive turn in the negotiations on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the US financial system.
Success is not certain, though.
Indeed, before the final version of the bill can be published and put to a vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, the plan should be put to a vote in the Senate by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement of the rescue plan should be the first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market support can be effective, a 'disillusionment' will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form the package of measures for market stabilization should take", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, to Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
The latter should buy back from financial companies non-marketable real estate assets that cause financial firms to suffer significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid said lawmakers are getting Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading begins on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
But at the moment it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will vote, or whether negotiations may be blocked at the last moment by a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount allocated to the scheme must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not doing its job, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount by following two steps: First an additional $100 billion, and then finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
While the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of making it a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad real estate securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Chief Negotiator Christopher Dodd, says lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, taxpayer protection from losses, the settlement of deductions, the timeline of the plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of the gold parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for property owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new settlements for mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And this is because we don't know what the mechanism and the price of the asset buyback will be.
This will be a decisive point in deciding on the loss sharing between the financial sector and the government", Marek told iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not as important, according to Marek.
"It is much more important that the Members of Parliament agree, as of this week, to support this plan and to dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time", Marek stressed.
A struggle that has gone to extremes: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll give you advice on how to choose
While almost all phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can play phones.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to get a self-reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone for the house to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such music products are not available on vinyl, and, from a quality standpoint, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But if you have a stack of vinyl records in your shelves with art rock, jazz, or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a phonograph.
The same goes for music on the go, which is compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to bear headphones bought for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes, and there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobile phones.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions of telephone calls and texting, it is capable of playing music and movies, recording them, has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can fry meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
The universal nature of the motive is not without its drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharges.
And playing music is one of the most important energy sources.
Very few mobile phones are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases significantly less.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) perform significantly better.
For cheap phones, you can expect them to play music for only a few hours.
If you also occasionally make calls, get yourself a second charger for work - even for more expensive appliances.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players, which are capable of continuous operation for at least 9 hours after recharging, including the least performing ones.
Another problem arises when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited number of devices have universal USB connectors, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to play without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as the drives are concerned, you do not need any software except (iPod).
All you have to do is fill in the music from the computer via the USB connector.
Most mobile phones and readers will create a media library themselves, sorted by the artist's name, album title, style, or user judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, while others are capable of both (iver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile phones have more know-how
When choosing a particular device, you should be particularly interested in the life of the battery, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output, and, of course, the ease of operation.
If music is basically background noise for you and you're only going to listen to it for a limited time during the day, like taking the tram, you just need any mobile phone that can play MP3s.
Almost all mobile phones today are capable of doing so.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that your mobile phone or player can read.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that's going to come through until you have that format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, online music purchases.
You just have to visit the corresponding operator's (or another provider's) web pages from your mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to acquire a musical motive.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is poor and is in most cases limited to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their motive on them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you just have to take your cell phone out of your pocket, while you've forgotten your MP3 player at home.
It is also important if you are always wearing headphones or a hands-free with a connection.
If not, you can use built-in speakers, which are available on almost all phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music devices is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand four crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of an exit for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipment, with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed 15 000 euros.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, anyone can get the most basic readers - which are not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette stand, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
What device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you consider buying an additional such card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can handle even 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walks (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent MP3 control keys, which makes the ease of control more similar to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman-series phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
The first virtual operator will be in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I can .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering almost the same services as their Western European partners.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for long.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz many times that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which reported that the price of SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation: SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration rate that is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators often complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no longer room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is choosing to join the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network seems to be less fortunate (in fact, it would be difficult to find frequencies at present).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable price decline, which was subsequently also to be met by traditional operators.
Yet even before the turmoil of such parties as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came to market, voices similar to those we hear in our homes today were heard in Britain.
But it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could be truly successful.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the mobile operator Mobilking.
In just six months, the operator has managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
The Bank's main business is the Bank of Greece, which is responsible for the financing of the Bank of Greece.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they require far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
In this way, virtual operators around the world are portrayed as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and text messages, which is often offset by a limited range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work in our own country.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segment approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services".
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area", Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try their best to keep a potential competitor from appearing.
GTS Novera, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, has not hidden for quite some time its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some we have succeeded in making progress in the negotiations", says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be bright.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by a complete silence.
'At the moment we do not believe there is any place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
At the moment, we have not been contacted by any complex and serious project in this area", said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project that could serve as a basis".
She added: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate within such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement now".
Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling the requests for its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means the most from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.'
The responsible authorities: in line with the operators
The move by mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the right to a fair trial is a major step forward.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ when the U:fon was created was by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ's webpages.
Today, however, the U:fon is being used as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: 'Competition on the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the RT mobile market, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high demands.'
But given the attitude of mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulators seems puzzling.
This is not the only attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries, does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
The Office is the sole owner of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OPC).
The latter took his typical position on this issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer from potential stakeholders has not a priori shown sufficient interest for the traditional operators,' explained Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS Foreign Affairs Department in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise from operators' representatives.
But from an office which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators are normally present, their entry into the market has contributed to a decline in the prices of mobile telephone services".
However, pressure to ensure the fair functioning of the market and the reduction of prices is apparently not in the interests of the HSEO.
What is shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
Similarly, a price for gasoline which is strictly the same for all petrol stations is likely due to chance and to the fierce competition.
'The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for its market behaviour.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even for the telecoms regulator,' Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by the ČTÚ that telecommunications constitute a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator logically has a monopoly on its network.
It thus necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least concerning to the OHIM that three mobile operators are clearly acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
The return of responsibility to the ČTÚ is a fairly common communication tactic whereby the ÚOHS washes its hands of the matter.
We have encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Law failed to introduce an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the OHIM must be aware of, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can walk.
However, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo-operators, many of them in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a multi-level marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer personalized mobile phone services.
The price lists of these firms are usually only available to elected officials.
The magic trick is that the company is in front of the operator as a typical business customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special offers for prices (and other)
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are saying happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions we are looking at and could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the company in question", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the mobile operators' officials.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
No operator, however, opposes such a procedure.
The fact is that these firms' activities bring them considerable profits, and at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name and therefore cannot be fully available to them, as ordinary mobile operator customers do.'
This is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises at the UOHS.
If mobile operators are not aware of such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has relatively wide powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we're not the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in the price of services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators sometimes tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
This is precisely what the regulatory bodies in developed countries did, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities treat this issue like a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it to a nearby target.
In the light of our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that confusion in skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the hammer.
If the background information is true and a virtual operator appears in our home soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is difficult for the ÚOHS to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four recordings of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my country?).
The national anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choral performance and an instrumental version.
The song is sung by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers and the choir had a good diction, so that the lyrics could be understood well, and they could sing at the same time", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th birthday next year.
Kde domov můj was first sung in 1834 on the stages of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Scholars' Kermesse), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem
Prague public transport (PHD) will introduce chip in its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be entered in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pockets.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about 100,000 people, who own the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and register it on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, coupons can also be purchased online on the Dopravní podnik website: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store may forget the ticket counters at the subway stations, where they have hitherto had to walk impatiently in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
They will purchase their voucher online and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these contact points, passengers have a shop with trained staff, who will assist them with online purchases and also record the coupon they purchased on their card", says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic vouchers on Opencard in vending machines installed in the halls of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the ticket composting machines, and passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should be eighty", Opatrný added.
A vending machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automata that will be running from tomorrow, they're easy to use.
You just need to enter the Opencard smart card and the coupon you bought earlier will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the city's surroundings.
The main routes are the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to reach the capital.
"On trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport in Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, which they use to establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons", explained ticket controller Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, which designs the schedules of Prague's public transport.
Suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's register.
When boarding, the driver must not only see the smart card, but also place the Opencard at the point indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and do not remember the expiry date of their coupon may rejoin the vending machines, which were originally used to store the coupons on the card.
This is where the document validity information will be displayed on the device's screen.
The Sudetenlanders demanded a referendum in the US
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposedly addressing the president of the United States with such a desire.
This is the result of a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans in Český Krumlov wrote to the US President asking that the "šumavská župa" (forest region in southern Bohemia) annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement should not be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says the letter, signed "Persons who care about the fate of the Šumava".
Since the alleged promise of joining Czechoslovakia - in the Czech national character - is only brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a State alien to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has done nothing to help the Allies win without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million people", the letter said.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of the desire for vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the views of the Germans in Šumava, he would have to hold a referendum in the region to decide whether the people wanted to be part of the US or live under US patronage.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive, some survivors say, given the current knowledge of postwar history, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of that time.
While the Czech Germans had at least anticipated the question of their expulsion from the republic, very few of them admitted that possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to gain some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein concentration camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they returned home, the Czech would be beneficial", says Chalupa.
He said that none of the captured Germans living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that Beneš's decrees would expel them from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety measure in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will be broadcast on television, radio, movies, the Internet, and in tracts.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and drinking while driving.
But also remind them to take their seat belts before they start.
It is particularly aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
The campaign slogan "bloody" is also a testament to this:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay".
Which must symbolize that one can pay for one moment of inattention.
The spots will be haunting the viewers until 2010.
The ministry drew on similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic images of accident victims are common.
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
The strategy of sugar and whips against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they fry a red light.
Whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of to drivers", says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is why we need press campaigns and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
He said signs warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly blend in with the environment and drivers will not notice it", Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in return for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, voted in favour of the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be achieved", he added.
He admits that the possible restoration would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially not to be crushed by tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in Jerusalem in July that killed several people and wounded dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic sites" within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he said later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Mr Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan", he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network), and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions arising after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move around inside the bus during the journey.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally enforced, the work of a steward is contrary to the traffic law", says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the bus path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle at the time, although she had two more seats available.
The bus may crash or even brake suddenly, even while the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is in accordance with its technical file and has standing seats or not.
If this standing-seat equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats, as the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"This is a matter we have discussed with the ministry and at first it forbids any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat", he revealed his position.
The Steward Is Ignored by the Law
"There is no single legal interpretation of the steward role - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prevents the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only knows the term 'vehicle receiver' and does not define its rights and duties,' adds Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there", he said.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing seats and a maximum speed limit, interurban areas with standing seats and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing seats with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) on safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"There is no danger in regular traffic, and the situation can be compared to that of the airline.
Here too, it is not certain when a turbulence will occur and the air host may hit her head".
"But if the bus had stopped suddenly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal prescriptions,' he said, adding that the issue was not settled from a legal point of view.
Jančura is ready to abolish these services
Student Agency is the only bus operator to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after the accident, the manager doesn't consider their job a risky one.
"However, as soon as I feel that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and diary on board.
It would also reduce costs", he said.
The reason for the absence of stewards in its vehicles is a safety concern, as stated by Alexei Litvine, the director of Asiana, which has a very small number of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have any hostesses. We've been fighting them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A great tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plzeň area, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop lane without using a flashlight and blocked the bus's path.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he rubbed him on his right side.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked".
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court's decision to compensate the girl's family, but it will also count on the perpetrator for financial compensation.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being worked out for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of stewards on the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone while driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards' activities as something that would fundamentally jeopardize passenger safety", concluded Hanzelka, adding that the safety control of buses is under the control of the police and the Office for Occupational Safety.
The hopes of the Düsseldorf are based on Frankfurt.
The words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
The letter published on Monday suggests that a merger of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with Deka-Bank Frankfurt could create the "central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group".
WestLB would bring a 'competence block' doubled by sustainable productivity in such a case.
In conclusion, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it is like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Authority that has made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's clients from their investment funds, and WestLB.
The Head of Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the end of August that he did not see any sense in merging the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, half of which is supported by the Länder banks and savings fund groups, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct negotiations with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The financial market says that the talks have only just begun.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial market, has been involved in consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a time that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate and Halbab.
But nothing came out of that ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse Land government decided against any involvement of the Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses were not joined either.
The Bank of the Land of Palatinate was linked to the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there were always new agreements on the merger of Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Management Committee, opposed any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
In addition, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
The German Federal Republic has already been elected to the Bavarian Parliament.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure to merge again should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it had previously withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe group of savings and transfers funds, which owns 85% of Helaba's capital, closed all mergers with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain strict.
However, such geostrategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Länder banks, had not been solved by the German grouping of savings and transfer funds.
In the long term, a WestLb split could take place, which is obviously not desirable here.
This is also what the letter from the Governing Board in place says: in any event, a 'comprehensive solution' for the institution would be sought.
How all this will be put into the same basket with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the Beer Festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, it's already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is accompanying him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter bottle of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds its throat can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta Nueva station, four buses will leave at 11:45 p.m. tonight, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arriving at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, one of which is exclusively for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing out and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And as loud as they are, explains Marco Guarda, they are not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with fake fur and large silver-backed glasses.
They've been going to the beer festival for five years, and they've been three times this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30.
Spending the night there would be unnecessary, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a German speaking group official - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses are driving at night on the Autostrada towards `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything is quiet on the bus, the passengers are asleep.
Better still, they'll need their strength.
Bressanone and Holzkirchen will be paused, while many other buses with Italian license plates will once again stop shortly before Munich on Highway 8.
When Marco's group arrived at 6:30 a.m. in the early morning at the planned parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe were already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, get your little yellow cap.
The above is written on the left `Beer Party', in Gothic, and next to it is the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Secondly: `When the doors of the beer hatch open, we run,' Marco cries out early in the morning.
Run and reserve places at the back of the tent.
`Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to spread them out in the room!'
The cup, Marco cries out, costs 8.25 euros.
And remember the recipe.
Show the security guards we're being nice!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: Tonight, coming back here is ten and a half hours long!'
And there it is, heading to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find the way, signs and even a ballot paper from a major Bavarian popular party.
We're just trying to be ready to go back.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian Weekend.
There are no exact figures; there are 50,000 who travel through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors are said to have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Municipal Police is reinforced by seven South Tyrol police, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians are number one ahead of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The tent of the Hofbräu brewery is particularly popular among Italians.
Night of sleeplessness for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister for Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a blessing that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he was saying that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis.
This one did happen this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is part of the DAX, is getting a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
A confidential source told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
Money comes from private banks as much as publicly owned banks.
In the background, the company-daughter Depfa is the one who is bearing the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has since been impossible because of mistrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, while the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were zero compared to the same period the previous year, with profits from the allocation of defined liabilities and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations falling by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
It was only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the interest payments according to the tax procedures and commercial purchases book for Konzern companies that the profit deficit of around 16% was found to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had at first been unsuccessful in speculating on industrial real estate loans, which were subsequently branched out to Aareal bank.
Since conventional State financing was not profitable enough, the Depfa subsequently became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must make depreciation which should have a substantial material effect on the group's profit and loss calculation which remains still rather vague.
The fact is, the dividends have been cut.
By 2007, they had already been cut to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions on the interbank market since it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again become significantly tight as banks have accumulated liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing facility for a part of the total amount of the Defa's credits - approximately EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets and is largely out of business at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Management Board of HRE, Georg Funke, explained that Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (Bafin) assume that Hypo Real's market capability is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have no hope of ever doing so.
However, given the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not unthinkable that the full extent of funding should not be used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
The Bank is still on the verge of bankruptcy on Sunday evening, but the temporary bailout will not be able to reassure the minds of the people.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debt at first barely moved, the prices of secondary loans are falling.
The most affected are investment funds from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, those with a lifespan beyond 2009.
The Hypo Real Estate Bank's bonds, which once seemed to be an alternative investment, are now to be regarded as being valued as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of Depfa Bank.
As long as the least affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, a resorption of the margins can be assumed over time.
Or something that no one dares to hope for right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the near-probability of security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should provide long-term sleepless nights for creditors to decide whether to break off their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn on to make a deferral of losses for the next years on the next capital gains tax automatically levied on stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to perform for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knew this word from the Mangas - in her new trading log, she talks about Japan.
"First day of class in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was already scared on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I must have found my way alone, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The start of classes does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in our home in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after another from eight o'clock until nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't yet have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this dress, I stood before the desk, and tried to pronounce it correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all had low-key mass, laughed and gestured, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him from my manga.
It's in the Japanese teenage survival vocabulary and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me smile a big ironically, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took their Bento out.
My stepmother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German housewives.
I had herbal rice, little sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some sort of meat surrounded by tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the prunes and salty jams, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Because I'm fascinated by it, what?"
After all, reading manga has been my favorite for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
It was very clear to me that I would travel there one day.
Because I'm also weak for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have sensations too
A rat or cockroach running away from danger, does that mean he feels fear too?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we know that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions for several years by renowned scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that neither I nor anyone else has been able to prove until now, just as we cannot prove that other humans have a conscience.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into areas that are difficult to practice because the hardware doesn't fit.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, runs away or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, which is why some scientists conclude that a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transpose our subjective experiences into those of animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in directional and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including our consciousness of who we are, and our ability to foresee and decide, it's reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another significant feature may lie in the linguistic nature of man: as much of his existence is linked to language, it often means that his conscience depends on it.
In that case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if the conscience were not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what the conscience of other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, cannot be measured or analyzed by this particular hardware based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
You could look at the processes of animal consciousness without considering their content, and that's exactly what happened in studies of primate short-term memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Strangely, this approach also highlights the prefrontal cortex's weight in making visualization.
But what about the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the local defense system in the brain (or its effects, like body reactions) takes over the living memory.
Emotions are closely related to the areas of the cortex that characterize primates, and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, are evident, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict this, but I believe it is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what is fear in both men and rats is likely to be felt as well in both cases: how could one verify if rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
I don't think that the same behavior is enough to prove the same experiences.
True, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stem, but cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man, how could we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior over the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is striking on the nervous level as the same measurement is made in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You could think of it as a short-term deal, but I'd rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux to be a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships in cooperation with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to be done in both countries".
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run past the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed", said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is always watching us".
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN would not be able to act in accordance with the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not be affected".
Several members of the First Division league were convicted of forced relegation manipulation in the previous season, and the start of the league was even postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant against counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has uncovered her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It's foaming - and counterattacking.
A Late Rose War for ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in front of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan told the U.S. newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this thought-provoking striptease lies in Ryan's press releases for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being called an unfaithful husband was clear: "It would be "monstrous", he told the New York Daily News, 54, "if Meg re-triggered and manipulated our relationship".
It would be more "disgraceful" if "the pain and upheaval of divorce for each child were to be reignited in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon be the father of twins.
This was his quick response: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel thefts and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, theft would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial again - according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 41 of the 48 European cities examined, compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this, according to American Express, are the low dollar price that has led to a "declining desire for travel among American tourists".
Financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 percent, a record in Europe.
The trend was also up in the first quarter in terms of flight prices:
As a result of rising fuel prices, low-income passengers have to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights, which are highly fuel-intensive, have even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in the economy class decreased by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter, they had fallen 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even split in two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices are, on the one hand, a sluggish economic growth, the firm says.
Demand would yield land in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure under the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid.
HSV beat Gladbach by 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes the first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to find a functional eleven.
The first is Kristoffer Klein, the second is the international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player didn't come back until late in the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was well-formed, it came out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal", whispered Hermann Rieger in the lobby hall of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, halftime was over and most had sat down.
Rieger was the physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a great reputation as many of the former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
The orders of which seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The implementation failed.
"Not everything was very beautiful to see today", admitted Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "desired to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime) was due to a successful head-stroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that Gladbach's very weak players could not hurt Hamburg's weak players.
"It was a dirty victory", Marin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121st birthday this Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, with the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking boards on the giant screen indicating their club as the first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back", said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful whether the mid-table result reflects more the unpredictability of the Premier League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and the outcast Jansen of FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it is not yet bright.
"We need more charm and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
Wall Street is a place of fear.
Early reports of the rescue plan's failure have caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss in all of history.
Later, the Dow Jones did catch up a little.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was at 10,579 points, down by as much as five percent.
The Nasdaq technology index was at 1,548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express at that time, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No more securities could make a profit.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank were down almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
The rescue plan requires the use of resources to buy so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must be paid gradually, not at once.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company which can be exchanged in line with the price change in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The price of the shares in the bubble in Europe and the United States
The billions of dollars of aid to banks in Europe and the United States are not a solution to the concerns of investors.
The stock price of the German giant Hypo Real Estate collapses and the Dax is plunging.
The US Dow Jones is collapsing despite the government's financial market bailout.
The dramatic fall in prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank has led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate investor's stock at one point lost three quarters of its value despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank accused it of a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and was 5,839 points short of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, the stock market has fallen to its knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the opening hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives was planning to vote on the bailout, and the Senate is expected to vote on October 1.
The other European exchanges also saw only one trend: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after a 1.26 percent increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index has slipped 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed up for 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
The fuel lines soon frozen, and cryogenic death is threatening.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been a source of confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver by space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This has surprised researchers elsewhere for years: Flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected by the venerable laws of gravity.
In addition, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which described the gravitational pull of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes as strongly as iron that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also found near the Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It seems to have a force of attraction that is visible in other celestial bodies.
It is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as Italy's Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shootings leading up to the release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would have already begun.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is a list of the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This was reported jointly by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, the Egyptian national television reported.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion are expected to be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers were said to have been close to ending the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting a halt.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the agent said.
All that was left was to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the Sudan-Chad-Egypt border area on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, and the German woman was to give the money back to one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom reported that a German mediator said the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the incident.
Abuse by a Father-in-law" Leading to Suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court has ruled that he regularly tied up his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, when she was a child, between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her up before forcing her to have sex while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980's and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an active volunteer with the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse she had been inflicted upon twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope for life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It's believed she committed suicide by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father who had also written a confession letter that ended with: "I tied her and bandaged her regularly".
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court".
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today".
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office minister who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has reported.
The defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
That is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of breaching Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the minister be placed under the custody of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work linked to the Associate Secret Service Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and security forces resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies against B&B invoices.
The British building companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "irritating" to know that companies and their members would have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest rates that will rise at the same time will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450m in 2009.
That means companies will have to find £81 million to pay their first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the building companies' trade committee, told the BBC that he felt the decision was unfair.
It is 'irritating' to see that institutions which were prudent in the recovery of the housing market now have to pay for institutions which are much less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the first records were made.
"We must look at all aspects of this case over the coming weeks, to assess the options to be taken to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill", said Mr Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September 2009 to the end of March 2009.
In 2010, the interest payments for the whole year could be doubled.
Since building societies are non-stock-based organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to five pence a liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following a twopenny increase in February, and follows a survey by a consultancy.
Retailers must decide whether they, in turn, will increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last varied in 2002.
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who could be arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her being questioned for extorting 50 million Taka from a businessman when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took power, but was released in June to undergo treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the allegations against them.
Worries about the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, according to the UN, because of Taliban violence.
The UN conducted a vaccination campaign last week in all six provinces.
But she says she has failed to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would have required it to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9% to less than 7,5%.
The Commission stated that in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares raised doubts about ITV's actual independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and Ofcom's regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB replied that it would not be reasonable to force it to reduce its ITV shares and was, on the contrary, excessive  especially since BSkyB had just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
This was the result of the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Justice Department, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officials.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potential criminal conduct, without any basis, have not been fully confirmed or resolved", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor who could force witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had said that prosecutors were fired because of poor benefits.
But it turned out that the fired prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which led some observers to attribute the firings to political connotations.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of voting fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting government-owned legal entities.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was eventually accused of being involved in this firing case, and he eventually resigned.
A number of ministerial officials in the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these firings, and ended up" abdicating his role as leader", having been remarkably successful in not being involved in the case.
Other government officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The rock star Meat Loaf, is due to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
The awards ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell definitely makes it go away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a high-pitched voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979, peaking at number fifteen.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the UK charts for nine years, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, as his real name is known - has been suffering from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to treat an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then we found a cyst in her vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and soon to be for sale.
New York City has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some purely functional.
And even some veteran taxis and longtime locals can't give directions to get to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 30 feet wide by 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty aisle than an active artery.
No signs pointing to the street.
It's virtually impossible to find it in a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to redevelop Extra Place, and create a smoother passageway to the shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block of flats.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlord committees, city agency and Avalon Bay officials drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There is only a small amount of space left for the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place", she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a coffee shop to which the builder would give space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned alley, and make it public", she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale".
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Real Estate Conservation Authority, confirmed that the city was willing to sell the street, noting that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical mark.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after this place since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance to CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
"This place was beautiful", said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, dresses, barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village's move to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying this humble little property should remain public.
Others have declared Extra Place a real rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow, dark, dark day and night, and bordered by rusty warehouse doors and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week flying down the drains".
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat runs swiftly down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, resting next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passersby reported rarely thinking of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were spent in dark, wet, and disgusting places".
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California academic and former director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think It Is. Why Middle Schools Should Be Allowed to Choose Their Schools".
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign highlights that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students".
To combat these differences, Mr Obama's education programme particularly advocates, among many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that supports teaching in class in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, an elementary school in east Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are mostly Hispanic, and they have low incomes.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, study English.
Of the students in CM1, 100% passed the 2008 State Mathematics Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English language-art-language exam
This incredible success was achieved through an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street is based on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Sixth Street principal Linda Mikels, the school introduced "full immersion" English instruction.
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have had no chance to identify her".
"It worked", she observes, "it worked for us".
Shouldn't Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results of this school speak for themselves; but the education policies within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the outlook for Mr Obama's response.
While he is in favour of immigrants learning English, Mr Obama recently considered this issue insignificant when he declared that we all need to stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"Instead", he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the education models that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them as insignificant.
Oil net drop following new economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people feared that the bailout plan for financial strikes would not bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures have dropped 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, according to the New York Stock Exchange, in sales this morning.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month before bouncing back in view of deep uncertainties in financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the biggest bailout deal in history, which was reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation", the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the bailout agreement, "seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"The prospect of overall fairness, interest rates and market exchange rates has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus would spread globally and particularly in China".
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slowing economic growth, and have been forced to cut oil and gas price forecasts by 20%.
The second-decisive time celebration for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in a Jets uniform, Shaun Ellis, the defensive end thought he'd seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 to a blast.
"I've never seen anything like this", Ellis said.
The second half started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played in the dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon in which their relationship jumped forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a cornerback fell and the second, 10 seconds into halftime.
"I'm not out of my zone", Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mean player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people thought".
While Favre and Coles were catching, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a missed shot and made it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball out because of Warner.
The last change, losing Bowens's ball, may well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets got the ball back, and Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal taking a 34-0 lead.
That was the best score the Jets have ever had in a season.
"Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, "The second or the third?"
When told the two - the Jets gave up 21 undeniable points in the third half - Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"Many points were scored in a short time".
Gebrselassie is resting, surpassing his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian, once again proved himself worthy of the title of best backstroke runner of the century, having broken his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 win in a comfortable flat race, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, set last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record in his superb career, during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon last month, perhaps exaggeratingly in today's eyes, fearing that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
Instead, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted to running backs, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered hip cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
Clearly, rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had my doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better.'"
He was blamed - most notably in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on the hare as if they were in a track race, and considering world records more than the meaning of the race.
But this criticism does not diminish Gebrselassie's great abilities as a thoroughbred runner.
Gebrselassie on Sunday, led by four Kenyans, set a time of 1:02:44 on the way.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the heads of the lines disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to break off Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best of five minutes.
Kamathis came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan and now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year by finishing seventh in 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe of England holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in the Beijing Games due to a back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal record of nearly five minutes at her third marathon.
She ran using a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a good lead, then outrun them about 18 miles and a half later.
Askalefa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenyane finished third in 2:25:01.
In a Separate City, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sunny, bright, giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to be incorporated, home of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, that description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays". The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison".
It has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes - which has become a tourist destination thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a distinct place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston reported that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who"knows so little about us, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of foreign eyes.
"We're very careful about how we tell the story", said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a longtime resident and the city's oldest parishwoman.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historic model of a black takeover of power and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of the rural black culture of the South - sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of slavery in America.
Which would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide turned this city, located just off the exit of Highway 17, into a road that runs through central Florida, often forgotten, that ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"On the left side of the road", she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and these well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read or write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells all kinds of drinks as well as anything that can be of use to passersby.
So in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't really a portrait that everybody liked.
"It's a beautiful song", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's daughters whom Hurston immortalized, quoting the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty".
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered as a lively, eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to come to town without warning, on a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today we take pride in traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora", he said.
But he adds, swinging in his backyard chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big memorial, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it brought to the world", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A turning point came in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-lane highway into the city to replace the community's two-lane main street, Kennedy Boulevard.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute led to hatred at the community gates.
"At that time, a bunch of young white men came and threw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side", said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead".
They threw a pinch from their car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education as "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director-general of the Eatonville Community Conservation, a nonprofit group.
She added that this continued until the time when teachers and students were no longer coming from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural line here", said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as herself, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
I can't believe this".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by best-selling author Robert E. Hemenway introduced Hurston back into the American canon.
The highway project came just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had regained her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston Festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening ceremony two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposed highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, is a real civic pride", said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by saying "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Nonresidents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic town since 1998.
A single-theme library (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a beautiful, refurbished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(we now count 90 percent black)
Strangers who come to learn about the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Most interviews require permission, and some things - like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, as Hurston Festival expanded, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed up than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a genuine civic affection that is echoed in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, they seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who pass by this area will think, 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it's a very beautiful city".
Everyone in New York City is fluent in finance.
But nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the storm.
They could never think that in glass and beehive offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York City, are spending the worst "day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The delivery men continue to sneak up on the sidewalks, carrying their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always hover around the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about 50 luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it's still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, because I found about 20 people in line at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase.
Not at the cashier's office, or to withdraw money or make a payment, but at the customer service office, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy's store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all queuing for the same reason as I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, like those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building society), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that say they treat customers like family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-dollar bank, has filed for bankruptcy protection, and as New Yorkers are coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, is desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they believe is reliable, the one that is the biggest lifesaver on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had for criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor at my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable salesman.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances".
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation of the "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They have road signs showing mosques with red stripes.
The police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized operation.
The criminals painted on several graves Jewish symbols such as the Star of David, but the detectives believe that this could have been done to mask the extremist sentiment of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow connected to the election?
A spokeswoman for the local Islamic Community said she was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is nearing its end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage following its rightward swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned against immigration.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing headscarves and burkas, and even expressed opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have identified the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made a difference, because they were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned glam rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, and of deportation to France and Spain.
The magistrates ordered Glitter to be banned for six months after he told the authorities he was planning to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt in child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then".
Glitter, 64, told authorities he wanted to go abroad, even if he was not listed on the sex abuse list.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before the planned date of departure.
If he fails to report his movements to the authorities, he could face up to five years in prison.
Kent Police said they would not discuss any particular cases or potential moves of Glitter into the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those of foreigners.
"We think it's easier to monitor someone who's staying in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting Kent residents is the most expensive intention for Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area to minimize potential risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he declared that he was not well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passports, and he eventually left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, was on his way to the limited court in Uxbridge, West London, to be registered on the sex abuse list as required by Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously served a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Interior Ministry said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes from strangers.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to achieve the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other person.
They're inseparable except in the privacy of those moments unknown to the general public, where you discover, through intimate gestures and stolen looks, artists who don't care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco - people" blends the theatrical aspects of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which grows every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy on stage... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality moments of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the personality moments of flamenco stars".
With the "Popular Song of the Mines" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, reminds me of classic photography.
The use of different styles breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, reflecting Bauer's perception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the dance or the singing itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work which is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are among the selected artists from around seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a collection of portraits on display at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts differ in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people, get to know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment or less.
I think in photography, portraiture is the hardest kind.
You're facing people, characters you don't know, or people who just give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I still try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Mata Street (a street parallel to the Peupleraie in Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel is set in unfamiliar places and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that features Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning author admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the novel he is currently writing "is a real daring" and that "everything proves he shouldn't write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will and I hope to finish it", he concluded in his speech at the four-day festival of ideas and thoughts that saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people marching through the aqueduct city.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award with the majority of the votes cast, filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "living new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical manner" through intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting part of the text to cope with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike", because writers were asked to "not indulge in frivolity" and to take up their vocation.
Bad weather is ruining the Pozoblanco fair
The flag-raising party that concluded the bullfighting at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning after horse riders verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was harsh on the fair, as two out of three parties could not be held.
On Saturday, it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race scheduled.
The poster featured José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the Castilblanco arena.
So only Friday's party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luke who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, after making hands-on, tasteful and aesthetic movements in front of the bull.
That afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered steppers applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse, El Juli entered the arenas of Los Llanos without difficulty or glory.
When he fought the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police check on a van in Alava province: 2,000 kilograms of hashish found
Five o'clock less ten in the morning.
Traffic control by the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) on the border with the Commune of Armiñón (Alava).
The police arrest two van occupants and the latter run away.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials from the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a vehicle check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the coast, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The vehicle was loaded with hashish balls on the rear of the vehicle, and then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not match the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the prisoner with falsifying documents.
The Ertsaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the seized drugs.
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28, was placed on probation for the various procedures and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Police Patrol, who told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pressing hard on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she was driving on her sunglasses".
Shortly afterward, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and get out of his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called emergency services because "she was concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked confused", so the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress cooperated and the alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "from the first-hand observation of police officers, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares urged the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to take responsibility in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation that will decide the case of former youth and sports councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of providing favors to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to take responsibility", Llamazares said of the political party's behaviour that he will have to adopt in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities Silva may have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases to the maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict codes of ethics for all civil servants".
"Blood of Mayo, the bold bet of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the film's presentation, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading the long list of actors.
The film, "Blood of May" will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci says that he has achieved with this film "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a film commemorating the 200th anniversary of 2 May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative was about national historical events.
The €15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with appropriate décor and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken for the leader of the struggle, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he was unable to shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The director of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and whom he does not cast, as this seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the director is to go to the theater and cinema to stay informed".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominees that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May", "Seven French Billiards Tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunshine", are not representative of young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect a price.
"You think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're just doing one more movie", says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón is playing the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana area and moved to London with her family at the age of three.
She was a free-dancing dancer and an expert in oriental dancing.
She had an exciting life, pioneering women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from free movement.
The life of this woman who shaped the history of European dance between the two world wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and I thought it was amazing".
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life story but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of her dances reminded me of flamenco.
So "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" of some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance was identical to hers", she says.
The staging was made possible by two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with her former student.
"Matilde is turning Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy that she accepted a role in my work and that is an honor for me".
The production was also made possible by the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, about the life of this woman who exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows or values her work", says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" concludes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" at St. Stephen's Church in New York City, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Andalusian Ministry of Culture to celebrate the "Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the "Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated in May last year and which, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, will travel to New York for the International Congress.
Similarly, the Andalusian Ministry of Culture purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America's less like it without Paul Newman.
"When God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them".
This is a line from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absent Evil", and it illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He was a good man for an Oscar.
He hasn't been on since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a big blow for everybody.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond words, and now I have lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of film and the country died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and the stock market were frightened, American self-esteem fell very low, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, all humans have left is admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for drug control created in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had to struggle to overcome a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying attention to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar high", observed George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained loyal even when opportunities did not spare him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifteck in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends his daughters meeting with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a philanthropist", he says.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we look at the race yesterday, we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of a final score.
But let us examine it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the removal of the backs, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they move you, it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
Well , no , it is .
They made you go there only to get the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long wait) surprise! there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small sized shirts with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the shopping.
Except for the fact that you have to go early to get the electronic chip out, the queue is 15 minutes long and you also have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for the races.
Since there was a long line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
Moreover, the rain accompanied the waiting for more than 40 minutes, during which there were riots and assaults on the hut.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, I would not think of it.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Games.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft was presented with a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, like calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to get around the company campus) in response to a conversation.
With a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them into groups of conversation
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but realizes that they are not part of the group that is talking to her and that they are not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she'll answer in a few minutes.
All this without a blue screen.
- That's impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, like the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of useless apps, they would go five times faster.
This is a breakthrough since Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add features and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing its importance but so is its software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for understanding computer hardware and software.
He's doing the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right, I'm not.
It will never disappear but the "death" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
You just turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than they do browsing windows.
Who uses half the apps that come with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they can finally become an alternative to Google.
I'm setting an example for you.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the Microsoft employees' restrooms in Redmond.
On the liquor store, a sign asks them to use their own search tool - "Your Search. Our Future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66 percent of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week, there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't be out in early 2009, but it'll be out in late 2009 or maybe 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But with Android being delayed and the iPhone already on the market, it's going to cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and is part of the Muscular Gay Association's costume.
And if we start listing all his appearances, we could also list this mustachioed couscous who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, moulded, sleeveless male body suit.
The English call it a 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which is related to sport as it is named, according to legend, after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished by its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive logo, and the little (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most famous body shirts have around their necks.
But beware, for the Belgian brand produces more than just tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
Her immense resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Now the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
Monica says they're not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion of the Mango brand in Paris at its new headquarters and also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera Dinner in honor of Valentino.
We're in for a very busy but exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango for this fourth season based on?
We're fascinated by the cinema of the '50s and '60s and we're very much inspired by it for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch women dress up, how they combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but eventually it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I loved clothes, and I wanted to go to my grandmother's house and look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear clothes, that's when you actually get into the character's skin.
So it's all connected.
You're not that long ago, you're 30 years old. Was that hard on you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are a joy.
I find that women are more mature, have more experience, and enjoy life with fewer problems.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done everything I've wanted to do since I was a little girl, and it's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body asks me to, and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you made last year to come out.
I can't wait for them to get out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I wish I had everything now but of course it's not possible.
I can't wait for the movies "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see what you think.
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don 't say that !
I didn't go up the bridge to be a model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her women's advocacy association, and the clothes we were exhibiting -- I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango -- were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a kind person.
They say so much about her, but I know her, and a lot of things are not true.
Besides, I'm fascinated by Naomi's good side.
She asked me to scroll for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make the lives of women in the Third World better.
Repeat alcohol users will have to install the alcohol lock system
The Minister of the Interior wants a driver who has been subject to more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have a system installed in his vehicle to prevent the vehicle from starting when he is drunk or not breathing.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and is now in the Minister of State's report, which considers it a pilot project for a year.
The aim is to reintegrate the driver into the driving profession by offering him or her road rehab courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation will also participate in this initiative.
Statistics show that between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who have been arrested for driving more than once while intoxicated return to driving.
Alcohol control would prevent this because it is a system installed on the vehicle that measures the alcohol content in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow first; or when the driver's alcohol content is higher than the permitted.
The cost is over €1,000 and is the driver's responsibility.
In this regard, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this system reduced offenses by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain, it's estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, nevertheless, reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
The European Parliament will vote on the proposal to install this system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At exactly 5:40 p.m. on official scheduled time, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City, Mexico.
The sun was setting but its rays still required a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, well, we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, that's all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Asturian princes are and how important the trip is.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military line of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she, with her hair in the wind, is dressed very sober and does not wear her usual 'peeptoes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They stop by the photographers for a short while before going to the room where the official parade awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny reporter on Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious fashion award
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and well-lived living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian winner of the first edition, Sandrina Fasoli, was looking at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried from emotion.
It is the second largest store of the brand in Europe, having just opened its doors with 1,335 square metres of floor space.
The first shop is in London.
The events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino, the president of the jury of the competition, led to a lavish dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family as a table next door, the presidential table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and a good heart against bad luck, due to the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a breathtaking mango dress and some Elah ornaments, and arms on top, arms underneath with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters tall.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a man of gall, and the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a vest because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store wearing a pair of pants and a shirt  from her own collection - and who for dinner changed into a sexy, black long dress - was moved when during the nightly tour of the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and, recalling the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay to visit the palace premises, but she showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone before.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martinez, another handsome man, on a motorbike, and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his sheets, towels and a request that there be no odor in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, there, there, there.
1001, the stress number
There are not only 1,000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost makes us sad when it rings every morning at seven o'clock, but it is even worse when we think of the agitated pace of our present life.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two ways to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has compiled a whole menu of methods for everyone's taste and time in a book.
The anti-stress book is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will be available directly from the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If the adrenaline is not flowing through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very much by telling us about something that happened the day before, but about the children who talk while they're sleeping.
The first time it happens, it might surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a mild sleep disturbance called somniloquy.
It's quite common, especially in children and teenagers.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, in association with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child has lost all memory.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night dizziness (bed peeing) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations, or over-excitement.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity of the reaction is also highly variable.
He may speak in a quiet, small voice, with private words, with murmurs, or, on the contrary, with screams, tears, long speeches...
If sleepwalking becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it's a mild disorder, so there's no treatment unless it's related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it's related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to arouse the child before going to bed.
Therefore, seek out calm games and avoid television programs or series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
As soon as sleepwalking appears, try to stay calm.
Remember, they are harmless to the child and the next day he will not remember what happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember, if the child is experiencing severe anxiety several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not be tempted to ask questions for information.
You're not going to get anything, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thinking.
You may also hear what he is saying, but you may not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell a child that you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even in a joke.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just a few minutes long.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory on his own land after a long period of hardship.
Without a big game, the Yellow and Black created the most opportunities and managed to turn one into a game win.
The pace was not very well supported during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who was visiting the ship and was scrambling the carrier on a long shot, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant slightly and turn around Fonderflick from a long distance, then with Hirn above, Roman from the tip of the foot or Diebold would come to chatter the defense of Dannemarie.
The front of the field was blocked and we just left the Riahi to move forward.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take a rebound ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the dressing room a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause any major problems to an Illoussian XI who just took a little step back to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play when, after a big knock, the ball passed very close to the crossroad.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of force by the fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit coincides with a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to seek measures in the face of rising gasoline prices, which have reached a record high of over 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the Elysée, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and salary for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected firmly by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted slough operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing clogs of nearly 10 km.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the routes to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been built on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and St. Breuck.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel coasts, such as the Sands of Olonne in Vendée, where the freighters were stranded, or the Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer family decided to wait until Wednesday's ministry meeting to decide on possible action.
At the Guilvinec, the 'crisis committee' is due to decide on Tuesday what to do with the movement and whether to participate in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who have not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "they do not wish to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, the chair of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gasoline, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the threshold of profitability of a boat is only reached with gasoline below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have all praised the film legend and the veteran actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company is on the list of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession to the global economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its forecast for 2008 deliveries with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado has reiterated.
In the first half, the airline delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been dismissed by U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it has been owed, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the paper said, citing sources close to the case.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision was taken on these divestments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan it was granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders proportionally.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to finance the implementation of the common agricultural policy.
The New York Stock Exchange has been accused of a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen near 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index by 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged into a depression after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan, which was intended to restore some market stability.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the representatives denied the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this", she added, fearing that a draft adopted in a few days would arrive 'too late'.
"If the project is indeed dying . . . then the relay will quickly go to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings a financial institution down" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking activities to be bought by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets are facing "not only an American crisis but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3,632%, from 3,827% on Friday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4,161%, from 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner of the first televised points match
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to determine who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters declared their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to halt his decline in the presidential polls five weeks from now.
The Gallup poll, which on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), says the Democrat has taken the lead.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39 percent of the votes, while 25 percent of those voters gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts", Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has always highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand what... " he has repeatedly accused.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he added.
A hammered angle of attack since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama, meanwhile, stressed that he represented the future.
Without disagreeing, he was concise and precise.
He has put his ability to make good decisions, and restore America's image to the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, while Obama has", a Democratic advert this weekend retorted, blaming the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "street American".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial collapse clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of collapse.
"The coming week could be a turning point", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current ruling "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would still be able to cut taxes by 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also reported that achieving potential energy independence for the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his top priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a 45-unit nuclear power plant by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates avoided the extremely unpopular $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night.
In Minsk, "did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as the polling stations in Minsk's central square were closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative process.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexander Lukashenko's rule: "Dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "Why not, since they will do whatever they want with my voice", says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of reconciling with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered proper by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of the election committees and our observers were not able to participate in the stripping", lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country, the executive power.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, they will be nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because 'the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don't reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that turnout figures appear too high, and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are best suited to power".
The silence of the night falls back on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate them on their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
HEMA-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as HEMA-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outcry, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, in February 1994, to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38 percent of people in Quebec still trusted the blood system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work in the years since, we have regained public confidence", she says, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, remembers that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
From its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, Europe was witnessing the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the disease that has been the dominant form since its inception in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when this is not known and a serious disease may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was refused to those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago it was clearly shown that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This incident showed us that the precautionary principle was a good one".
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique was introduced: nucleic acid tests (NTAs), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be directly detected in the blood of donors and not antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used up to that time were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which runs from the time the person is infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the expert.
We were able to reduce this to less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected unwittingly and untraceable.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of contracting HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it will take 12 million blood products to be distributed before anyone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that one can feel comfortable today receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health", says the head of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not long after last year, Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Decary, before stressing that in addition to secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The need is increasing because the population is aging.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be refilled with red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population is also affecting the blood donors' network, which on average comprises only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation".
However, anyone who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but more importantly, to keep them from giving and to encourage them to become regular donors.
"We are so busy in today's world that we rarely have time to spend an hour donating blood", says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and are planning to take more than a thousand a year.
The idea is that transplants should be available early next year", says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division play-offs, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 goals total) against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the overall goal-scoring quarter-final series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining goals in the Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the home-and-away series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals 5-4 on aggregate goals.
The Impact are scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win over the Canadian in the Florida Panthers' home playoff game last night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists, and Kovalev scored a pass in that win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six pre-season games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to do too much in the first period", noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a nice ovation".
Charest is set in the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's General Council was over, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
'Moving the boundaries of our last great northern frontier': this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the mainstream, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin d'images.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by Google Maps, maps, and so on were shown in a loop.
A lot of money, like in an election.
In a press release, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would trigger elections this fall, although he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth part of a 'vision' the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic space', which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
The opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation, as has been often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a gem of immense potential", but did not give a specific timetable, investment amounts or priority for future projects.
At most a few avenues for further development: hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, which is being doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr Charest.
This "territory twice the size of France" is our home, it's Quebec.
Not only is it in our home, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
He stressed that Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a line on the border that has not been agreed on for a very long time and when the opportunity arises I repeat this position on behalf of the government", he said.
"With climate change, we must rethink our view of the North", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of his predecessor Liberal Prime Ministers.
"Like the Liberals before us, we thought differently about turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One resolution adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Power Station to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the revolution quiet and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future", said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he cited another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It's still between us, but I plan to be", he told his activists, prompting applause from their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, as the law allows him to.
He stressed that his schedule was, however, being fulfilled, including a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also called for Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for the latter to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has been skeptical of the Northern Plan's outlines.
The leader of the Pekinist party, Pauline Marois, has highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had, "we would have been more advanced today", said Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the current election), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show", said leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaces Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr Vic Toews, former Justice Minister at Harper's office, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To cast the disgrace upon this woman who has fought a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves our full admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its nationals imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged events.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and has allowed a child soldier to be cremated under inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that is turning a blind eye to torture: it does not care if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of torture.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", a word that Harper keeps on saying and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned according to the good will of a government leader until now a minority (what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes virtue, law and order. They do not see that this government has given up what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr Toews, is there in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its 17 September issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, the paper claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a $6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house in an attempt to launch a "transparent public debate".
While judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in defamation cases, but the law.
It is not surprising that this fundamental difference is completely overlooked by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will scare the opposition and frighten anyone who dares to look at the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually held by exchange of ideas, not by batting.
The mining industry was therefore able to open up its books and files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and has rejected petitions and letters of support for the Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a 'public' debate while disregarding the views of that same public?
In the vice president's world, it seems that this word only refers to the high-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have a say.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the writers and editors of Black Canada is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but not on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a "bully pursuit" (in pursuit of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using the term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold prosecution is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in its entirety, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not pleasing to the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the writers of Black Canada.
She has a right to retaliate.
The academic community to which we belong has long been a master at handling debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the academic world, as it is to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides for better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to American daily life will be immense", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been on the brink in the last few hours for fear of the effect of a further failure on the investors' mood.
The deadline we agreed was the markets opening this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidential election, who were late in the negotiations, were rather favourable to the agreement, but they were also dissatisfied with the fact that this had to be done.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has said that some provisions have been added to the agreement, including one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and one on the salaries of the heads of the state-owned businesses.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be flattered about.
But these measures are necessary", he said on US television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The broad lines I have read [shows] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and we're going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to use taxpayer money to buy back dubious, risky, unsold assets from U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (sub-loans) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze in liquidity and the bankruptcy of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republican voters who had the first draft of the bill overturned last week.
It is believed that this deadlock has been lifted since the Democrats accepted that some of the "toxic" assets of the struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
To make matters easier for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to take five years' worth of losses with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of 250 billion, which can be added to an additional 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion more should be approved by another vote in Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get a stake in the rescued companies that will pay dividends on profits and sell them back when the ordeal is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure procedures for housing attached to the housing loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be approved.
The vote on this bill continued yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic parties.
"Obviously Washington is not listening to you", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one about taking advantage of taxpayers".
The leader of a small group in Congress called the "Cacus of Skeptics", Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us that Congress is being asked not to rush and to consider carefully what path to take", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witness to the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was abandoning its wholly-owned competitor after losing €2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the US risk mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not a waste of money", said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos, yesterday.
In return, we get a vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that savings and households appreciate now that the times are uncertain".
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalising another bank plagued by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
Her blue-eyed beauty was her asset for a long time, some will say her weakness.
Did he break free from the narcissistic mirror, the charming American actor with a smile?
Yes, and no.
His modesty, sensitivity, and talented flow of the source also removed him from the register of power that gives birth to true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the 1920s.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was long a kind of rival on screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German-Jewish father and Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without a self-exaggerated ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he was the building blocks of a country that loved the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actors Studio in New York before triumphing in theater, television, and soon cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled in sex symbolism, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
He also discovers the shadowy areas of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the bursts of show business, whose enigma has not yet been fully solved.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance has thrown the film industry into a headache this weekend as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh ever-changing American artwork is traversing it.
The charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) comes to mind, the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman's gone down in history.
This Rocky Graziano, a delinquent, tortured, violent, unforgettable boxer in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This cute little bad guy in the brilliant movie The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter pool player and avenger in Robert Rossen's 1961 superb The Hustler, he reprised the role on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar nomination in 1987.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's the one again.
Times are bouncing through her journey.
Young people know him best through the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in which Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team, plays the character.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as Irish mafia sponsor in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who left the business early enough, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its bears, fastes and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, not without humour, "as a living challenge to 'underplaying' judging its performances too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman whose roles long fell flat on his face.
However, he was less often a first-rate youngster than a marginal youngster - neurotic, alcoholic, crooked, or desperate - whose perfect traits reflected his drift and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed some of the lesser-known aspects of his true modest sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine portrait of a woman with melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of praise pouring yesterday over Newman, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (who had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights, ecology, independent film activist, a Hollywood derogatory dissenter.
Many have seen its twinkle sit on jars of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process to be quite bad taste, although it is not at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to her Foundation for Disadvantaged Children.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters with the following sentences: "All the time and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his fine star.
It was a privilege to be here".
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in short.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company have been producing in their invoice factory?
The hearings on the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with fraud, as a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, causing particularly serious damage.
The prosecutor's office said that the money from the grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipal funds, which totalled about HUF 65 million, went to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and to the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to make money from the grants obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
They obtained invoice books for the latter at the market in Józsefváros, while they made the cigarettes in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies to be included in the invoices were decided, inter alia, during the tours of the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the witness's testimony, he was supposed to be spotting boarding houses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices they were to introduce, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Capital Municipality to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drawing up the documents necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, the place provided for the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy the place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice issued for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which later became known as Egütt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and a maximum of ten people could stay overnight, but the bill mentioned 130 customers.
The overwhelmingly imaginative invoicers also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp".
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, 100 people were staying there, was also not a problem, since the establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
Besides, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time".
The enthusiastic invoice issuers also did not inquire about the travel agencies of Budapest, which were part of their choice but only organised travel abroad.
Moreover, as it appeared from the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while benefits for travel activities, which are destined outside the European Union, are charged VAT-free.
Similarly, the VAT rate on the four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp by order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not bear a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT.
The investigation by the Prosecutor's Office reveals that the 'issuers' also made mistakes in referring to the transport of goods by road as a service, which the invoice issuing company could not exercise, given that its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for irregularities in form, such as types of inadequate invoices and false seals, that the invoices issued by the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were found to be false.
The same is true of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó's sports training company, both of which deny that they are the authors of invoices issued in their name.
The counterfeiters also failed to pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Invoices prepared deliberately
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has drawn up an invoice for the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and in 2003 issued invoices for the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but no benefits were actually provided.
There was also no financial movement, as the invoices issued were later cancelled, but the authorities avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is those directly related to the defendants.
The administrative representative of the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which was responsible for the fuel and automotive trade, was Ivan Kubatov, whose headquarters were in Budapest but where he was not present.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment were allegedly purchased by Kiskunhalas' Cash Investment Kft., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov was also reported to have sent documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices for the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and de Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and that he pocketed their counter value.
It was at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons established the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not getting jobs.
He nevertheless used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and the draftsman of the company's founding documents, he had invoices drawn up on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov has given 15 invoices to organisations, in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices and VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices which were used in the course of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the socialist party's public benefit organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for a double amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes stated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these bills were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the defendants will report on the method of invoicing, as they had done before the prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest or whether, possibly, the Socialists would have made an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably upset, since requests for his residence under surveillance, based on a reduction in his conditions of detention, are constantly in the ears of deaf people.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to proceed with the procedure, but it has decided to proceed with the procedure.
Psychology of over-auction: why spend more money?
When auctioning, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate the goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at New York University have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be excluded from this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to establish a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" by using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, while the other group participated in a play auction, while the researchers used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (FRI) method to analyze the brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, where a key element was the over-auction of a third, the whole under the brainstem, called the striatum, became intensely mobile when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believe that the rise in prices is due to the leakage of the striatum's violent reaction.
In support of their theories, the economists in this group of researchers carried out financial monitoring analyses.
In these, three groups overbid one partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if they won the game, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
While the third group got the $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money if they lost the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that the focus was on one group's victory, while the other group's focus was on failure.
In this way, the team members of the "failure" players were willing to bet higher than the control group and the "win" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Each of these explanations was based on the pleasure of winning and the risk of risk.
Only neurological imaging has helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, now leading to a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
There are an estimated 100 miles of hepatitis virus patients in Hungary, but only seven miles are being treated, because often the patients do not know they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms, with liver inflammation and jaundice being characteristic, but the pathogens and the diseases they cause are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g.: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers are advised to get vaccinated against A and B viruses anyway.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor overall health, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then on the skin and white of the eye, a visible yellowishness develops, stool becomes lighter and urine becomes darker in color.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from the most serious form of the disease, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they have the virus, because the pathogen subtly destroys liver cells, and in many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening is very important.
The contamination rate is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoo artists.
Currently, there are an estimated 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if detected in time, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of pain reliever, which would have already helped make Catholic martyrs more tolerable to die.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment in analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence human tolerance of pain.
In this strange experiment, 12 Catholics and as many atheists were electrocuted while each of them looked at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out much of the suffering.
Using a human brain palpation technique, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment is conducted as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electric shocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look continuously at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not much different from the first, had a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received 20 electric shocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that seeing the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", "cared for", and "calmed down and peace prevailed".
When they saw the religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image that they react very positively to, say, a mother or father", said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality", Wright added.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect would it have on the regulation of subjects' pain if the faithful were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or a painter of the same calibre?
Would seeing a better quality of the Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found in people's pockets just as well as the sky above their heads, knowing where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consulted and what their interests were.
Yet that is not enough yet, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the most influential people in society.
While skeptics who are aligning with Orwell's vision of horror do not see the core of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users, which is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their original goal: "Let's gather all the information in the world into one system!"
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global scrutiny, they are still just beginning their goal of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What job would work best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of simple, first-hand question when it knows enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently accessed by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they've searched for, what they've clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and our recorded preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly rebellion against power that can cause a backlash among internet users.
It is a confirmed fact, however, that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing for identification.
Human rights-conscious internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May when Google, with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to a trial before the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier.
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is lashed out at by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google services.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "savages" bringing together computer enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "technical corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which is listed as the world invader because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for IDs, does not ask for money for applications, and the document code and the software package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect on the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what Web 2.0, the most widely used keyword in recent years, is pushing behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication that are available to us, and while the dimensions of these change one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person can generally post a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and they can even link it to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing their musical habits. Then they can link it to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also post blogs, in which their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
While many examples, such as the girlfriend who can easily understand from the morning photos taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company who fired one of her employees, can be seen only from the sincere opinions that this person wrote on his blog about top management, one thing is certain: the term privacy is totally reconsidered these days.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that's how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search engine, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately don't register on public pages so that they can't be found is not small. Google's online services, from word processing to image processing to information reading, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and don't combine our best profile, which has existed to date.
The public is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, now valued at $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense ad domains threaten advertising agency revenue, while the services being introduced at an increasing rate are causing serious migraines not only to Microsoft but to many other computer program makers.
However, critical observers find, besides all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the company's top management has rejected, in its entirety, the employees' protests after doubling the price of the company's nursery and after the company has found multiple daily catering, taken at any time, too expensive.
One of the company's internal rules is that new services are not announced until they can be used. What's certain is that in the coming months and years, they're going to move the world in new directions. While some think that Google's scanning and archiving project for books and magazines is taking on such a big dimension that the company is about to face the U.S. Supreme Court, others are trembling before its Health system, because in it, we can build a full medical profit from our pre-analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database could give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The famous novel by Cory Doctorow, written with half-Orwellian tones, describes a future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two miners helped to dispose of the traces of Ózd's double murder
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of Ózd, and they were suspected of helping to erase the traces of the crime", said a spokesman for the Borsod Police Department.
The young men have admitted to the charges against them and are now being charged with complicity.
The two minors, who according to MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves freely.
Compliance with murder can result in up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in provisional detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, premeditated and self-interested.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that is why he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the man's nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man had planned his crime, and the weapon he was using to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered €200 million, or about 5 billion Czech crowns, to buy 100% of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the proposal made by the Poles despite the Czech authorities having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares within a few months of operations.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid ever made for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new least-suited owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns.
Under a deal between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with around 25 per cent stake, followed by the 14.7 per cent stake in Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the European press' perspective
In their comments on Tuesday on the worsening global financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already referring to a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president", says the Rome daily La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a whimsical, improvised bill designed to help a desperate situation . . ".
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett has said, it's more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11 attack.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the view of the daily El Mundo, the failure of the political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing day by day, and as a result, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real danger is threatening, one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still provide a life-saving net to their shaky financial institutions, and with taxpayer money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the EU countries to disregard their national selfishness and centralize control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - the Vienna daily Der Standard reported - and the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deeply, similarly to Americans, in order to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is moving one by one across the old continent.
The "saviors" should not immediately be dragging out a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise to note in what cases it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car mimics the steering wheel
What better method to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle than to imitate an obstacle detector already in existence in nature?
Like the one about bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the starting strategy to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C type self-driving robot control system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own oval-shaped space, which in fact looks very much like our secure protective shell - said Kazuhhiro Doi, the head of the brand's research and development and technology relations department.
The bee's faceted eye plays a vital role, as it is capable of seeing in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers have approached the idea of the laser telescope.
The system identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres from the BR23C, assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a maneuver of avoidance.
The detection of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, and then the mini-auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning them at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the mini-robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility and Robotic Car Project Laboratory.
It must act instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collision is currently considered unavoidable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotational motion, acceleration and slowdown as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot.
BR23C uses lighter Lithium polymer batteries with a higher energy concentration, which makes their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
Andoh says instinctive intelligent response is paramount, not data processing, much less storage capacity.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It doesn't have to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilo-octets of memory continuously.
We don't need a memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even a megabyte.
This is the first step towards the design of an instantaneous avoidance technology, and Nissan estimates that the system will be rolled out to mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the baby a name that was priceless.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, designed to redeem the banks' questionable loans, and to use them repeatedly, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters reports that during new debates lasting until midnight on Saturday, local time on the east coast, congressional leaders agreed on the days-long controversy surrounding the total $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives, adding that the only thing left to do is to write the agreements down.
The compromise, born of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, commented on the compromise results and said that the programme would work and be effective, but that further measures still need to be implemented.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8pm local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2am local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a dramatic increase in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that is the equivalent of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme also differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent in one go to buy back securities on doubtful loans.
From now on, half of the $700 billion can be spent, with the first $250 billion being issued immediately after the bill is passed by Congress, probably on Monday, and the first amount going to the Treasury Secretary to buy questionable bank debt, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the Chairman of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The second half of the 700 billion is dependent on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat can implement a combined strategy: it can simultaneously purchase doubtful claims, mortgage and doubtful mortgage securities, and other types of 'toxic' claims.
The relevant authorities of the Ministry said that the purchases could be made through an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance scheme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it's the massive repurchase of doubtful debts, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of the system causing the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary measures to be ready for the implementation of the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
On the other hand, bank executives who are in bad shape and waiting for state help can expect their departure allowances, simply called the transatlantic gold parachute, to be capped by the government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in very specific cases and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Department provides assistance to the business.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Department buys in an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the gold parachute unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the doubtful debts are redeemed, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that the amount paid to the executives is not exaggerated.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment and the environment.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal limits will be in place on the appointment of CEOs", said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the scheme, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they may even be winning the deal once the economy and with it the saved banks are back on their feet.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be repaid to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were those who expressed doubts about this plan.
That is not why the American people have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayer dollars, said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks it's the same people who are pushing for action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1% compared to July 2008, while they decreased by 3.9% compared to a year earlier.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7% compared to the previous month and by 3.2% compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only slightly: 0.1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors have only slightly increased by 0.1% compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was seen in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8%), with firstly bag and belt manufacturing with a monthly increase of 4.6%, followed by footwear production with a monthly increase of 2.5%.
The higher levels of prices for plastics and chemicals have led to a considerable monthly increase in prices for the manufacturing of products and chemicals sector (1.6%).
This resulted in a deflation in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9%), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, printing and printing remained the same.
Other sectors of the processing industry increased by between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which play a major role in national industrial production, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a comparison of 12 months, the most significant increase (32.4%) was seen in the prices of the oil processing sector, taking into account domestic sales of the processing industries.
In the metalworking sector, prices increased by 13.2%, while in the major food, beverage and tobacco industries, prices increased by 11%.
Prices fell in the textile and textile products sectors (2.5%) and in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
In the whole processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors surpassed the previous year's by 18.7 per cent.
Among the groups of domestic trade and by sector, the sectors that generated the most significant monthly increase in prices (0.7%) in August were those that generated the most profit on investment.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3%, while those in the energy and processing sectors were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing (16.8%) compared to the same month of the previous year.
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8%, while in the profit-making sectors, inflation was 1.4%.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3,9% over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment rate against the euro has weakened by 1.7 percent, against the dollar by 7.1 percent, and against the euro by 7.5 percent and against the dollar by 15.9 percent, compared with August 2007.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that by January 12 the visa-free agreement between the United States and Hungary will come into force, the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
She said that "now it is only up to the time when the transatlantic electronic entry and control systems are put into operation".
She has always pointed out that under the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major U.S. presidential candidates, assured their support for the government's $700 billion bailout plan.
After days of marathon negotiations, Congress and the Administration finally announced early Sunday that they had reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue banks.
This financing plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves as more capable than the other to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with economic issues highlighted, Obama has again managed to get himself a little ahead of schedule.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would soon pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection clauses which he also supports.
"Now is the time to act responsibly . . . a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sector and the stability of the entire economy", he said before a crowd of 35,000.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time swallowing it . . . but doing nothing is not a viable option".
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Oversight Committee and the cap on departure allowances for senior officials, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that there was serious hope that the House would vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press magazine for the German-speaking territory
The right wing is intact, and it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - as Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in Bavaria, points out.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black.
The Spanish authorities have not yet taken a decision on the application of the directive.
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of times is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not a surprise, but on Sunday a process that was likely to take place just ten years ago came to an end: the undisputed hegemony of the national party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was up 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, it was below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, at the time of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this can be attributed to the "parent-eating" modernization, which the CSU has consistently implemented in the region.
The social scientists have been announcing this for 40 years but they have been very wrong about the pace, however secularisation, the educational outcomes and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the booming Bavarian region could not remain unaffected on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right wing is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it has been the groups of traditional citizens who have moved away from CSU rather, such as freelancers, artisans, bachelors and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the reservation in the face of coalition issues", the Austrian conservative daily deals with the confused domestic politics that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations, and the Greens are still unwilling to agree on a coalition.
Elections have taken place, now the whole thing revolves around the coalition; in debates on public television, party leaders barely let their cards show.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ chairman, confirmed his desire to discuss the matter with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is already the case in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor remains open on Faymann's part.
As he pointed out, the Schüssel-Molterer guideline was rejected in any event.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer has been cautious about the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or coalition is currently a completely open question, and these points must be discussed within the ÖVP.
The BZÖ President, Jörg Haider, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid a coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities", said Haider.
Járóka said: We must break the cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equality of Opportunities, hosted by France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, has opened today in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP from the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention to segregation in education as a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and thus one of the main barriers to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The persons invited to participate in the consultation include the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil society bodies in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Parti Popular group, Járóka warned that apart from the distinctions seen in hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market primarily because of their low qualifications.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youths do not have a high school diploma, and as a result of poor primary education, only a small percentage have the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree".
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in upholding other fundamental rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma means strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
The European Parliament has also called for a European Parliament to be formed to support the efforts of the European Parliament to achieve a European Union-wide dialogue on the subject.
The earlier a Rom child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; he contributes to the state budget by taxes paid on his income and consumption.
"As citizens of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and be protected from low quality and sectarian education", said Járóka.
The European Union's objective-oriented cooperation and action are needed to accelerate the process of de-segregation of schools immediately, and for this reason it is of paramount importance that the existing anti-discrimination directives be complied with and prepared.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunities they need to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe", Járóka demanded.
In the name of the European Year for Equality of Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities, which has been held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be made in October.
Despite this regrettable electoral failure, the heads still remained unturned, and the debate on personal matters at the Bavarian CSU summits was postponed.
The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent of votes, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized couple, at least, felt that they did not care particularly for their seat.
They worked to appease the angry members of the faction and the base, who, one day after the "Bavarian tsunami", demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - indeed, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian-Socio-Union won 60.7 percent, whereas today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" in Bavaria, contributing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong hold on this southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who was introduced as Huber's possible successor, was also given a place in this modest recognition group, which is initiating tactful discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as the Free Electors, formed along right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange twist of fate was that, with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as an opportunity for a coup by the Huber-Beckstein duo, was then mercilessly treated by the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has hitherto been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also take an active role.
On Monday, Huber made some harsh remarks to the CDU, saying they should have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish, with a common force, the CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005.
Merkel, who has difficulty concealing her disappointment with the fiasco, said the loss of CSU ground would not negatively affect the Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MP has entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegal voting practices.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature in the country of 10 million people has been under great opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDCF) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, on the trail of the 2006 constitutional amendment, would "allow" the presence of a few opposition MPs in parliament this time.
In this way, the ODSZ has abandoned its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order dubbed anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, in assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on running for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote-pulling.
Despite all this, the opposition is still feeling a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have been freed, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and the region of Abazia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been started", Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "the government has been afraid in this weightless parliament of bringing in even one opponent".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results, but rather tries to convey its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, local authorities are putting sticks in our wheels for the broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even among the elderly", Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that under the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main outcome, the laying of the most officially supported pensioners no longer really accepts it as appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'called the silence of a cemetery,' is now only a matter of time", says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds". Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today on, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of Chigi Palace have we had a revolving door for employees to enter and exit.
But from today, this new measure is in effect against the little smart guys who point and then go and drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-laziness policy was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
 The revolving doors, says Brunetta, are an instrument for working better, with more productivity, more people and more services", the minister said.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It is reformism", Brunetta further points out.
The installation in all the premises of the Council Presidency is completed by the Chigi Palace.
Masi says that "the choice of revolving doors is even symbolically important.
The Secretary-General assured that no resistance from the employees was recorded. "This is a process shared by the employees and we have had the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during work hours; no more coffee or grocery.
Brunetta's promise, which he smiles at suggests, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a great and healthy resolution".
In a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
The Minister of Health and Social Affairs of the European Parliament, Mr Gutierrez de la Paz, said that "in three months, sickness absences among public employees have fallen by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the public administration more efficient.
The Italian labour force, whose wage dynamics have doubled over the last 8-10 years compared with the private sector, and have surpassed inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Works is today reporting on the decline in sickness absenteeism in the workplace", the Consumer Association writes, "the number of 'active lazy people' continues to rise.
In Italy, thousands of decent and productive public servants have come together to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar contested the exclusion of additional allowances for disability due to service; the extension of the hours of stay at home for sick workers during which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions proposed by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Crucial prevention'
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work-related accidents, 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities occur.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workplace Accident Victims, which is organized on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data published by Anmil, together with the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace", said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of the Handicapped and Handicapped.
The President expressed his "sincere appreciation for the ongoing association effort to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness".
"Naturally outraged, everyone has fisted to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, are causing media outcry and public participation, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the education sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep our attention on this phenomenon, not to underestimate the social gravity alarm, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to end it quickly".
Data on workplace accidents seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Pietro Mercandelli, president of the Anmil.
"we don't want this 'discounting trend' to translate into actually, a minor attention, because it's exactly when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, there is not enough to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and that the contrast can be made through multiple actions".
 In our view, emphasised Mercandelli, more controls and inspections are needed, as is a greater intervention in training workers, starting at school".
- he added that further efforts are needed in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed in the face of a social emergency".
 Mercandelli then denounced the "gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of labour" and the "derivative of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
 The aim is therefore to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker  he added - so that the fate of the accident victim must not depend on spontaneity or the extension of the legislature'
They're pointing fingers at the MP3 player, they're putting the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for extended periods of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announced, citing the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the EU's unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) published today in a communiqué in Brussels.
"The scientific report states that 5-10% of those who for at least 5 years listen to music at full volume using portable music devices for more than one hour a day and a week are at risk of permanent hearing loss.
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and mobile phones at high volume may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data", continues the EU official, "this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies.'
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the directive to the Member States.
'The scientists confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data well by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
The European Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music for extended periods of time in such conditions may lose their hearing permanently after five years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
In Rome, Alemanno has ordered the Commission to set off for the future of the capital.
We start today, we finish in March, we draw the money in June.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome, which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commissioners will draw up the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so that the Strategic Plan for Rome with the official stamp of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno will be presented in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there", emphasises Alemanno.
No overlapping roles, just the desire to have a corner to develop a big project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her tasks and then disappear, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June the mayor will announce the strategic plan for the future of Rome Capital, which is the result of the work of the Commission".
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look ahead and further into a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The mayor of Rome also wanted to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, and will be used to study and involve the best intellectuals who express themselves in the capital.
Germanno said that "a strategic reference plan, neither firm nor immobile, is needed to enable our city to improve itself, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now in a united spirit".
The mayor of Rome said that the future would "not be limited to the usual communal boundaries, but look further not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also in terms of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady in Miami wrote on a website: "This person is ambitious".
Obama is really shy: he believes he's going to win the highest office in a nation that counts on everything, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president?
In this case, it's still someone who speaks from the heart, not the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we know exactly who the American patriot will vote for.
Here's an aspect of the American mentality that's been kept secret until the very end.
"Say what you will, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on, Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear, if Obama wins, we'll leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
When asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his term, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, that nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even by journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attached, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Furthermore, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is to be reduced significantly.
A clear but complex pessimism is invading American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists at print newspapers are convinced that journalism at national level is going in the wrong direction.
Local executive is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are making a move to the Internet, which many see as the "assassin" of newspaper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hoax in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms - the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national managers are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "safe work".
The number of managers who think they will lose their jobs within three years is 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The question of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
The directors are almost always paid a lot, whereas the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years passed.
But, according to their findings, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
The Court of Rome has decided that the Court of Justice of the European Union must decide whether to grant a stay of execution.
The president of the Second Criminal Division of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his hometown of Grottaferrata for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-BNL escalation investigation.
At his trial last week, he was granted house arrest and made a permanent resident in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the provincial city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travels (which the PM did not allow) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence against him.
The elite are in danger.
The phenomenon was already evident a few days ago, with the House voting against the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this, reporting that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between its former East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to "the Washingtonists" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern states.
The very soul that has been despotically made to feel with the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake has foretold or already caused: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been taking place for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these is the revival, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for the ruling party, which is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also electors.
In short, the crisis appears to be global economically but politically, it is almost only national.
The European Union, as always, divided between different interests and national strategies, cannot decide on any common policy.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit allocation: when you go through a difficult period, only the states have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back on track.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements which no market or international organization can ever have in an analogous way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that recent economic developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, as we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of networks, increasingly sophisticated technology, non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to settle our accounts more and more with rather intangible things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but are absolutely bound to a limited space, to a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, he certainly has more cards than whoever is not, that is, the one who is unlucky to live in a place without crops, oil and water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a break.
Which says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And then there's something even deeper, in a sense even more disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of alienation that tends to involve the entire management class in a growing number of Western countries.
This further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites up to now at their height, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership is underground, fueling a powerful and branching movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifests itself in the improvised electoral 'rebels' or, in the recent changes in the collective mood of the latter, from the conservative rise in Bavarian Austria, to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone might say, are finding it increasingly difficult, which is not current, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially agitating in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, it seems frankly exaggerated to mention a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda.
But they say, keeping your eyes wide open, it's not without reason.
The superstick to walk on the walls.
Overcome the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
That's the goal of several American research centers, and today a team of four institutes has nearly succeeded.
With a sticker measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The U.S. journal Science published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from geckos' legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that ensure the animal's perfect grip.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile's legs, and at the same time, it can easily detach itself from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
MARCHING ON THE WALL? " this material could be used as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also looking for a new adhesives.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented a glue made of microfiber-like hairs that self-cleans from dust when moving on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Be careful with grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, when combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their efficacy, depending on the case, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, reminds us of the risks of fruit juices, whether bottled or fresh, when combined with the ingestion of certain medicines; at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, canceling out their beneficial effects and putting patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, stamina and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICAMENTS - The Italian Medicines Agency itself reported the news in a two-year newsletter warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLAMELY - According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medications.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies, which will need to change the information notes on medicines if necessary.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist", the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics is for Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy, and was criticized by economists for years, but now has proven true.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a "very aggressive" disclosor, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excess liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
Today is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office package is being shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen and the revised and less austere interface, to more important ones, such as the compatibility of the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some module-specific functions, such as the one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, or for importing PDF files into the graphics module, keeping the page's original look.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe graphic format with elements of a worksheet or text editor.
Multi-person collaboration is an element that has been improved within applications: in the worksheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the development of texts, as each collaborator is assigned a comment color for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of the features of OpenOffice to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to the home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it to homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office is now facing the big challenge, already relying on various projects in public administration and schools.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the quality of the services provided by SMEs.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video equivalent of Word; Calc, the spreadsheet intended to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; and finally Drwa is the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and given that we now have almost 3.600 million miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl, too, is positive. This is the fourth doping case.
Another positive case in the last Tour de France: Austrian Gerolsteiner Bernhard Kohl, third and winner of the best climber jersey.
It's the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth-positive cyclist at the third-generation EPO, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests on Kohl's samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the results of the tests confirm the positive results at the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and will be forced to wait two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus winning the peas jersey of the best climber.
Immigrants: The New York Times asks if Italy is racist?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" who were reluctantly welcomed.
This is what the New York Times is asking about, which has dedicated a long article discussing racism in Italy, based on the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what The New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the Nordic regions are both those with "more integration and more work", but also" the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most significant support for the Lega Nord"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Even the new legislature, which the Lega wants to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic pointed out this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, in his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to overcome racism".
Students who are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the rental union, renting a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such serious dimensions that it excludes entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from other countries have to bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, unlimited rental contracts, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
In Milan, a bed in the Brianza area costs about 450 euros; a single room costs 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, the average bed costs 350/400 euros, a bedroom about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it costs 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370-500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), the cost is about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (€550 for a single) for the areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way to save money is to move away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, 450 euros for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300 to 400 euros, a single one costs 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, you have to count 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extracommunity students, there is another anomaly: rents demanded from foreign students are increased by 25/30% compared to those applied to Italians.
Goodbye old Paradiso cinema, the cities are lightening up the historic halls.
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the emergence of large multi-screen theatres on the periphery and the death of single-screen theatres in central urban areas, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear is often to be found in historical and memorable places, "it's like a friend of mine disappearing, someone we know, with whom we shared a journey and so many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film that gave Tornatore its first Oscar and Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury 20 years ago, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia for a lost way of life in cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, tell the whole story: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the theatres in the main cities have paid the most: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 lost single cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the main cause of their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, as the three Italian regions have recorded the most new multiplex cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italy's economy has grown irrationally", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a hall is closed in a city, not all of these frequenters are necessarily willing to go to multiplexes.
The Commission has not yet taken any further steps to ensure that the Commission's budgetary commitments are met.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government is not respecting the existing laws.
The sector would need between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year to support it.
The first Italian city concerned about the closures, Bologna, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single cinemas in historic and outlying centres.
The regulations include tax relief measures for managers and public mobility benefits: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and special parking and parking rates will be applied.
"This is an initiative that I like", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by implementing further measures.
However, it is clear that to counter the super power of multiplexes, traditional theatres also need to improve sound and image quality, as today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place where I grew up and was a teenager, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much of shared emotion, I turn to the other side to avoid seeing the signs blackened by dust.
Political ties with ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
 The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan".
The Magistrates of the Directorate for the Prevention of Mafia in Calabria have filed heavy charges against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for outside competition for mafia association.
The handcuffs also go to Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his young son, the lawyer, who is the boss' namesake, already convicted of association with mafia-type criminals, and to pay 10 million euros.
"An affront to legal and moral norms, and above all to common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Mr Piromalli.
"The clan would have been granted official entry into the town halls", the judges wrote, "facilitating the already considerable possibilities for control and guidance of public administration".
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organised crime are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is higher than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest".
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, when the police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been removed from their role of managing the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of its dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 vote.
He shouted outrage when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, of manipulating the whole thing for a political issue, but given the arrest request signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
The interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the prime ministers write, have revealed "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a better known group, close to the Piromalli, unifying the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big ones are going to jump.
This is a massive deposit that occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have looked at, and now they're trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, at the same time as the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When oil prices fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new rise in oil are giving the sector a big boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by systems operating at sea.
This would be twice as much as nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossus is on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it was a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more candidates from these companies, which have always been committed to traditional energy, are turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for the oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating opportunities for cooperation with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a deliberate permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to produce a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the United States is still extracting oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are tracing the energy path from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are unknown, observers say, indicate growing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because marine energy does not dispel fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to pose a major problem to the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave force, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure on the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
The power is sent to shore via submarine cables.
We have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing power for a shopping center and parking lot using six submarine turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water during tides turns the turbine blades, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant announced it had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to draw power.
After the waves, the tides.
A special interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, is due at this time to the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, among others, are looking to the coast, investing $7.5 million in 2008 and projecting up to $35 million in 2009.
