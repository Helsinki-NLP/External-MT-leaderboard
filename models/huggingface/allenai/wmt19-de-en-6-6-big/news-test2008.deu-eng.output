Foods to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, according to the Statistical Office of the EU in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the benchmark interest rate. Judging by the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment, the lowering of the benchmark interest rate would favor the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB seeks to keep inflation below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be "agreed" in order to exclude the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent in November, the inflation rate in Germany reached a record twelve years; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area is attributable to higher food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotes rose 88%, and the soybean price also reached a record high since 1973.
Edible oil and dairy products also experienced substantial inflation in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate for the next three months, but put the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
Experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup detects government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference among the party ’ s loyal voters is clear, thanks to the strong determination of the opposition ’ s supporters: more than two-thirds (71%) oppose a fifth (20%) of support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they account for two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the general economic sentiment has further deteriorated - never before has the proportion of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are seeing the change in their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without a change of government.
After last October ’ s riots, 35% said they wanted the government and the head of government to stay, but today this figure is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60% answered that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would "probably" vote.
By way of comparison: if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go to the polls "with certainty", and another 15 per cent consider their participation "likely". In view of these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital fees.
Applied to the group of the referendum "with security" participants the portions of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would amount to as much as 81, 84, and / or 89 per cent.
Most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has again increased by 16 percent this year, although price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets "davongaloppiert" last December, the inflation did not turn out drastic proportionally, compared with the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for last year far below 9,000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF threshold by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year ’ s level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with Auchan however there were 1kg bread roasts for 139 forints.
There was no competitive fall in product prices below 200 HUF.
Also surprising was the price of a two liter Coca Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" basket, comparison Auchan scored the most expensive, and Cora the most favorable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket by 15% compared to last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18%.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of the past year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forints, but the VAT increase made itself felt in the prices at last Christmas.
Exactly this process hit the retail trade badly: Apparently the department stores could not really decide, which price range they should use with the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase were unforeseeable on the consumer behavior.
(If the trader badly plans the speed of circulation of a product, he may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the inflation of the "Napi" shopping basket in the past year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 HUF, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 HUF.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest one saw a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
In the comparison of the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase became apparent, the price of the daily consumables in the hypermarkets rose in less than 20 months by more than 30 per cent.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily corroborate the data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some staple foods, the Statistical Office recorded a more than 30% inflation rate over a 12-month period.
For example, flour and eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain. It is continuously reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer pay any attention to prices.
Large quantities are bought from everything, durable food goes into pallets over the counter.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so many multinationals complain to pollsters that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overburdening of staff - these are all factors that are not conducive to the control of infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
The Traumatology Department of János Hospital has recently diagnosed an MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient admitted to hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured man from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the body of the patient.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 multidrug-induced infections from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, senior physician at the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the number of unreported cases is likely to be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin or oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the doses are too high or if they are used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotics which are resistant, and under appropriate conditions spread rapidly in hospitals.
Particularly in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the everyday life of the sick house.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not exist only where it is not searched for.
Antibiotic resistance
"Such patients are isolated, nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks for care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and old people ’ s homes, the hospitals should examine the imported patients and isolate the infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is less common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance for this investigation.
According to the medical director of the epidemiology centre, most cases would not come to light until the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary in order to prevent resistance to the remedy, although this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatient or primary care patients.
Is Gespart with the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to another by nurses.
That is precisely why washing hands or wearing gloves and masks is so important, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds just lined up, although there should be an epidemiological distance between them of at least 1.5 meters.
As Karolina Böröcz notes further, it unfortunately happens in the financially less well placed hospitals that disinfectants are being saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost promote the development of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be far less common there, and the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are adhered to, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment was recorded in the government programme.
According to first indications, the program is successful - as published data shows, the tendency of MRSA to infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals, one of its priorities.
Death-thrower, police chief was not drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now retired chief of police of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest High Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former chief of police turned into Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district and ran over a 55 year old man who crossed the street at an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra crossing, inferior rank.)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then retired from his duties.
The Budapest prosecutor ’ s office has opened its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
Further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements totalling EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, with the aim of supporting education, transport and environmental protection, infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects to be implemented with Cohesion Fund grants. Previously, the EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million loan.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract will also be used for the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed a EUR 50 million agreement, which will mainly be invested in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It has been agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the U-Bahn financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Interest rates are fixed at EURIBOR and the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year grace period and without any commission.
Bulgaria, the EU ’ s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying close attention to the previously seldom mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys what is still the cheapest market in the EU but is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought-after place for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the most popular, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the interior of the country will also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the exceptionally favorable region of Ruse will also see more buyers.
The capital city of Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers ’ paradise, attracting tourists not only in the summer and winter seasons, but also in the other two seasons.
As a result, prospective investors are already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying property in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also potential buyers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while in the Black Sea and ski resorts there are mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 50 100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5 thousand euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
To the second category belong those, which are on the search for a vacation domicile (Bulgaria was listed in December among the Top Ten vacation destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital is constantly getting more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years prices have increased by 21% annually.
The rise in house prices far exceeds the rise in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced that the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and that the debate on the international climate, post-2012 regime, will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali roadmap, which sets out the emissions-reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 25% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support the developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on assistance to developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subordinated to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be administered by a 16 member council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020, the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (compared to 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" would be achieved successfully, and that the Union would even be ready to commit to a 30% reduction, while other major industrialised and developing countries would also be willing to fulfil their obligations with vigour and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target set by the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985, which the country will certainly meet, as can be read in the Environment Ministry press release.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which is also underlined by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in its latest report.
This would delay emission reductions and make it unavoidable to increase the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 ° C, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
The British Air Force (RAF) first discovered YouTube: since March 2006, special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban into the Internet, reports the BBC.
The images, which are shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, are checked at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Unavoidable political message
Soldiers of the Luftwaffe have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" was viewed more than 75.000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign missions.
Such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television commercials, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the justification for the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise With game
But the army also has to fight against amateur recordings which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings, also make it onto the net - such as those which show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos of the war theatres in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans advertise in the somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier in a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogache in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of holding a Christmas party, she is organising a work conference at which her employees can wind down the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas atmosphere with a raffle or toast to the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already reached the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held this year in the defense department, but not the employees of the ministry are expected.
At the "Christmas Party of the Orphans" children are given presents by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Party" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are entertained, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort will provide around €25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other portfolios, the National Agency for Development (NPC) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are beating the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, with around 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The focus of the festivities will be on Christmas, but there will also be live events and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The rent for the hall was 1 million HUF, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" theatre was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the persons in charge.
Why the suit?
The OIT ’ s building was open not only to the NFÜ ’ s guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ’ s Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] they said: There was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Government are each preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees at home for about 400.000 Forint.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth officially does not invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to a conference at the end of the year.
One counts on approximately 180 guests, who - so the press department - only with coffee and Pogatsche to be served, then the celebration with 350.000 Forint goes out.
Self-governing Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) hosts a Christmas party in its own ballroom, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were calculated with 2.500 Forint per capita - around this money there is a buffet with a following toast.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of PM celebrate every year in this way.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on 20. January to a New Year's Reception, the Christmas party of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Chateau in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses amount to 1,000 forints per guest.
As reported by the press department, it will be a very simple standing reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and end with a restrained feast.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Museum of Applied Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage will begin.
It is expected that there will be considerable traffic disruptions due to strikes, as rail traffic will be almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest Public Transport Company (BKV) will also strike until 1 pm.
Details of Monday's strike will be announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act has not been defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss the way forward.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will not take place until later in the evening, or even until midnight.
Due to the strikes that will begin on Monday, traffic will be severely disrupted: the railwaymen will leave their jobs indefinitely, most of the public transport will stop in the morning, and more than half of the companies will stop working.
At the same time, there will be one-way highway blocks in many places.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations have responded to the call for a strike - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period, while others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian Railways (MÁV) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) were unable to reach an agreement on sufficient benefits, even though more and more people are travelling by train during the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will stop their work for four hours, and the teachers' union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for two or two eight-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike on a country-wide basis, alternating at different times. The EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government should withdraw the draft reform of health insurance and propose a new conception of social discourse.
The second requirement relates to the gradual introduction of the new pension model, which will become due from next year.
Requirement number three is that the qualifying professions should have access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
According to the research institute, the main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma" question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now based their political strategy on the Roma "Hungary" opposition ".
It is thought that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontation.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention paid by the domestic and foreign media, have "seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
Let us remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on a continuous upswing, so that since summer 2007, several organizations calling themselves "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"What these groups have in common is that they each define themselves as a civil organisation, while they openly boast of preparing their members for defence tasks (civil protection, national defence, law enforcement), sometimes armed, citing the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state itself," they said.
And again: all this is happening according to the method that tries to camouflage as a bourgeois initiative various political aspirations based on the political and party moroseness of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the association form do not serve thus only the evasion of legal hurdles, which could emerge in the course of the registration with court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region "- they said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma, a mass outcry that took place in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU took the events as a reason for the foundation of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was the "national protection".
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" was felt in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - said Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have triggered a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma have announced organisations to create their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, at the request of the news agency, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if trends change, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so the practice of rescheduling the working days around the public holidays has become established, but the coming year will bring us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America something else is understood by "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are usually religious holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are non-working days - the latter alone so that those celebrating New Year's Eve can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are 15 March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, which commemorates the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the foundation of the state is celebrated, on 1 May the work, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays seldom fall on a weekend, the practice of "working-day shift" has proven effective in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we work on the Saturdays before very well, or have to go to school.
For many years, the Labour Minister has laid down in a separate regulation when this day, which falls before or after the holiday, should ultimately be worked out.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and establishments, in which the enterprise is continued without interruption, thus also on the holidays, are excluded.
This year, the work regulations are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From the 24th of December, life in this country formally stops, as most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially abolished holiday.
Next year, more public holidays will fall in the middle of the week, i.e. at the end of the week, so that there will be less rescheduling of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, the Friday, 24 October will have to be processed in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely dedicated to the holidays, after everything will be on hold from 24 December, even if New Year ’ s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent trifles to annoy colleagues
T he mails that we forget to send out, voicemail messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether to get used to these minor inconveniences, or rather to face the challenge and consciously try to avoid these ambiguous, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and remorsefully confessing that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Usually the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before getting tangled up in embarrassing excuses, one should consider how to prepare truly unpleasant moments for one ’ s colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowed something that does not belong to yourself?
There is nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it is gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on the desk of a colleague?
You should not borrow anything from colleagues without asking, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has got away.
So, no envelopes or post it from the office in your pocket, because it could even meet you: none more there, if you need it urgently.
Getting chatted about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop gossip that has already begun.
Who with whom, what made?
Where and why?
If possible, one should not bind the information (or conjectures) about the private life of the colleagues to the nose of everyone!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than to pass the message on to those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you call the office to report illness, citing agonizing headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable at the moment, or simply want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unpostponable errands, projects with fixed dates must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So do not play along badly with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won ’ t be able to get into the office the next day, or that something might happen, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Crying, giggling, phoning
One is just absorbed in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of his female colleagues?
Inadvertently listened to a telephone conversation, which one should not have heard better?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you carry over their heads), trampling, constant scolding or grumbling.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not particularly engrossed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
As far as possible, one should not stop at the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were also affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for the omission is all too appropriate.
In the office - a feeling like home?
Practice pants and slippers: Comfortable for the home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Not even if the workplace would allow it, you should dress so casually!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues as well as yourself so much that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it all right - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go the traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which is played on mr2.
The local music scene did not spoil us with qualitative Electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you listen to Zagar ’ s new album.
The release of Yonderboi, many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar geckish is "in" again, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, played in the band Yonderboi himself, before he started his own way - maybe because an inn can't take two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which blends elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he only managed to achieve when they approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The band, which had initially performed in smaller clubs, only became known to the general public when the magazine "wan2" listed their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only marketable trendsetter in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but nobody was interested in whether they also liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but even the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was on tour with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but apart from the ethereal character of the music, the loud guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - the influences of rock 'n' roll are noticeable.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
One song from the album even made it to a radio hit - mr2 Petőfi, which broadcasts pop music from early to late, successively set the catchy tune for the listeners with the track "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local female singers ("Underground Divas").
All right then (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain class?
Balázs Zságer: The term "Schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two castes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, just as it can only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop number can arise from an honest motif.
The receptiveness of the listener also functions according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it ’ s a good feeling to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience can usually be felt at concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this is only possible in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: if you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built up his career more in the West.
B. Zs: We don ’ t really go his way, not to mention trying to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us come from his band and have taken a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs: We had no plans to write a hit, which would then serve as a driving force for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the orgy of sound and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers?
Why just them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Z.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to put the choir together from talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the choir of six came into being - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs: The number has been available in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still "needs" something.
The chord sequence formally demanded a vocal part.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came almost immediately and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at that time, but it also needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: But on the record as well as at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay ’ s short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is it deliberate?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was due to purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately wanted to give them no solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one ’ s ego a little, forgetting who has come from where and where, let ’ s just let those particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs: In the musical work actually none, there were rather more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but little by little everything has come together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favourite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes constantly with the concerts and also now that I have released the album.
Currently they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the track "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Bottomless Deceiver
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, describes its former employee Jerome Kerviel.
It was worth almost EUR 5 billion because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues and was certainly not incompetent beyond that.
Unlike all major banks, he timely recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He is rather mentally weak," he said from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as can be seen from the statements made by Kermani in the French media, for example in the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who made a profit of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already some news that sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those that had previously had payment problems, would run into trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
By the end of the year, it had increased its profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn ’ t know how to explain it, ” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn ’ t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admitted that he had falsified documents so as not to be found.
He even succeeded in deceiving his bosses, even though the Eurex “Stock Exchange ” gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid of flying up?
Hardly.
"I thought it satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he find the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position step by step.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"From my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
He earned a lot with the shares of the Allianz by betting half a billion euros on losses in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the policemen.
But the bosses supposedly knew, or rather suspected, of everything.
"As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the Bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find out?
He made himself suspicious by taking a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn ’ t take a holiday is one who doesn ’ t want you to look at his cards, ” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission yesterday signed a total of nine development programmes, which will enable the Czech Republic to obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion crowns from the program "Enterprise and Innovation".
The biggest amount of money, around EUR 150 billion, will go to transport development.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion at its disposal next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme aims to attract entrepreneurs and firms to innovate.
Companies should thereby win finance for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprise research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous money acquisition from EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
An appeal court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state will be put behind bars again.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court found that Alemán had regularly moved government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
This is the first budget that this government drafted and that was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party) and the ČSSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate that preceded the vote on the motion of censure against the government, this time there was nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies calmly approved this traditionally neglected yet highly significant law.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more rewarding subject for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
State budgets have suffered from three weaknesses in past social-democratic governments that the 2008 budget cannot address at once:
The first is the high proportion of compulsory expenditure by law, not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure, which was decided by the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is deficit fiscal policy as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficit of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
But the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
However, the budget deficit of the municipalities is a real time bomb.
Many mayors, in order to tap other sources of investment besides income from taxes, duties, and bank loans, often issued imprudent bonds through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other utility networks that they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now that source has already run dry.
To the extent that we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we determine that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years now, and the ČSSD never ceases to praise it.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, largely due to previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated on a gigantic scale in recent years.
Although it has been possible to eliminate some of the senseless populist expenditure that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age and pension reform are not postponed in the near future, practically all policy in that country will cease and, whoever is in power, he will be left with nothing but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that ruling politicians become officials who mechanically distribute most of the tax revenue between pensions and social spending.
So this year ’ s budget cannot be a revolution; it can only stem the displacement of normal spending by compulsory spending.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion foreseen for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they did in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, desiring calm in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these make it possible to gradually implement a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to overcome crisis
The United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will enter the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend to each other.
For example, the US Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, and it is making another 24 easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the attacks of September 11, this is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the main difficulties facing the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a US recession from 65% to around 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion on unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
"Central banks must have been really afraid of all the things they could do when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro Chief Economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
After failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks, central banks have decided to do so.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend to each other, even though central banks in the US, Canada, and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is helping to heat up the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the US housing market.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is supposedly doing the most harm to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus returned to the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali, which is drawing to a close.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "Ein blauer, kein grüner Planet" (A Blue, Not a Green Planet), he stated that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that the topic of the book was very important to him and that is why he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
Now, interested parties can read his position undistorted.
Klaus pointed out that he was not a climatologist, but that in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, capable of understanding and judging professional treatises, had experience with statistics, and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and thus do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as someone with experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, and he regards this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Responding to questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield. ”
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at Hayek ’ s institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange, so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving rights will take to the roads.
According to the authorities, it is mainly those who do not want to drive that have not exchanged their licence.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in exchanging tickets, the offices of the capital are showered with applications, and interest in exchanging tickets grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers a day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
The issuing of a new driving license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the compulsory exchange by the end of the year and start driving without a valid driving licence will face a fine from January onwards.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of SEK 2,000.
The police can, however, leave it at transgression with an admonition.
In case of transgression, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, anyone who does not drive at all can also be punished by the municipality.
He could, it was said, be punished with even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the authorities to show leniency and to impose a fine of no more than 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, nobody is to be punished with a thousand crowns.
The driving licence is a document for anyone to decide whether or not to possess it.
It is not an identity card that everyone must have, a valid one at that.
People who no longer want to drive should hand in their driving licence.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers will also gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of colluding with David Berdych ’ s gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one and two years respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened to live for 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is facing the first instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences totalling 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to any more.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robberies. Today, the Higher Regional Court tried the appeal of 16 of them.
From the outset, most of the accused denied the indictment on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with, among others, Berdych criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The gang left 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also arrogance and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser target telescope and a submachine gun.
According to the prosecution, the gang has enriched itself by millions of crowns through their robberies.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych ’ s circle must answer for themselves in another trial; other cases have not yet reached court.
The main hearing has so far eluded Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children swapped - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree at all with the Veleba proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is far too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"In order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, however, we need the expert opinion that the opposing side has produced.
We shall ascertain whether it is meaningful at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone ", stressed Mr Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month they did not raise their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, the children ’ s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees and depths.
The men tolerated the stressful situation better, even if they saw reproaches against themselves, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
The women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is currently happening, Veleba summarized the contents.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the District Governor of the Vysočina (Bohemian Region Moravian Highlands) gave each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the mistake made by the hospital in Třebíč, which belongs to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In case of doubt, they will have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation sums to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and were in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the designation "Wallachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not the end of the matter and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polivka's parasitic," said after the trial Polivka's lawyer.
Everyone introduced themselves with the words "Walachian Kingdom" to this actor and comedian.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We have done almost ten years of work.
fundraising and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the occasion is dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also benefit from it.
They want to be parasitic in our work, "he continued.
Lucky business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Wallachian King" for the first time in one of his television programmes.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him in 1993.
At that time, however, this was not connected with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an originally fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then followed the foundation of the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in passports and even offered their owners discounts on visits to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who dedicated themselves to him intensively.
The cooperation of today ’ s divided parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organised the official coronation of Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, polívka and harabiš have become more and more divided, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I, elected until Saint Neverless Day".
At the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková, the leadership role was used as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today dismissed.
The contest for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity in the dispute.
From this a new king was to emerge.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush.
It was to be something like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register, "Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi
To tell the truth, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed so that not even two meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
The interior I go through only briefly, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I only have objections because of the poor central tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the days when we complained about seats or headrests that were too short are over.
The lateral support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can feel the increased dimensions of the body here as well.
The already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the station wagon.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo area.
I have to call it (also because of the hinged back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, they can be pulled apart and hold heavier objects.
But let us talk about the loading volume.
According to the table it is 428 litres in the basic configuration, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains behind by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when loading a pram.
But to highlight the Positiva, I have to mention the very flat loading space after folding down the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And, to be honest, that ’ s what a 1600 cubic cube engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, low consumption and pulls well away.
When I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems as if his exhaust is clogged with a cloth, I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not really popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns in addition to the book.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper release, electric rear windows and so on...
Thus, the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but add up the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is to decide which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
British schools are seeing an increase in the number of children from Eastern European countries, which is causing the local people to fear for the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Controversy, harassment, and wrangling among students have transposed to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed to the point where the Chatham police arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and thrown stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then bared his buttocks, "a Slovak student mother of The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Great Britain, there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here to look for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures stolen by the Spaniards in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, cars drove across the broad boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojímar.
Stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar of the Hotel Nacional, you can mix your own cocktails.
And the cult cars of the fifties still circulate in Havana today, because the formerly imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have been badly run down, nowhere else in the area can you find so many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned up, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose contemporaries are elsewhere long since in the museum.
Excursion destinations
The majority of visitors to Cuba do not miss out on the most important places.
So you do not have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just to mention that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum, the visit of which should not be missed by those who like this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it went unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth to visit interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancon or the "valley of the sugar factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
To be sure, this view is also influenced by the path to achieving it.
Both roads, leading from Guantánamo, have to cross high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List thanks to the untouched nature there.
It is the place where the best chocolate is made, where you can see the Columbus cross in the church (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus travelled), and from the hill where the former castle, now the Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra, Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as they say, it is better to look at things with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, has called for NATO units to be more active, the UK has prioritized strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development assistance.
"Progress is being felt in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants themselves to start a further development of the economy and security ", says the British Minister of Defence Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety per cent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by as much as sixty percent.
NATO ’ s countries have deployed some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organisation and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the near future and how to achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, made a similar statement today.
"I am not pleased with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety per cent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have also been at loggerheads over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The number of Germans in Afghanistan is relatively high.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and where the fighting requirements are not as high as they are for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan idlers exposed: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in an article, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt will soar to a trillion in 2009
Each Czechs has a national debt of SEK 84,000.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt with 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on government debt from the beginning of October.
A debt of 84,000 crowns is owed to each Czech.
Throughout the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not exceed the 1 trillion crowns limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns, "said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, to the iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, takes a similar view: "We could get to the 1 trillion mark in the course of 2009.
Exactly when, depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political stage turns out to be changing, and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change, "he remarked.
Growing Debt
The national debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the growth is mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the public debt for 2007 indicates that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount comes mainly from the state budget deficit, which this year will apparently reach SEK 76 billion instead of the estimated EUR 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum planned appropriations for the Consolidation Agency amount to CZK 13.3 billion, a ten billion reserve for paying pensions, the financing of government bonds amounting to EUR 43 billion and instalments for loans to the European Investment Bank amounting to EUR 1.8 billion.
She was brought before a court in Khartoum today for giving a teddy bear a name.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days ’ imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of having allowed six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
It deserved to be flogged.
After several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this affair began in September, when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
To be sure, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children made a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not carry a sign bearing that name, but the problem is quite simple: the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she had never done anything to offend a religious faith, but I am sorry that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher, who describe her as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common second name in Britain, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last negotiation meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasising that peace in the region was at stake, Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult period, he added, and indicated that there are significant tensions.
End of conciliations on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is inhabited by 90% Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane are to submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika was mandated by the UN last August to negotiate a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo ’ s independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia has been, and remains, an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Mr Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, Western countries believe that independence under EU supervision is the only solution for the future.
Pristina is ready to declare them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations of the last chance have been conducted.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to killings and deportations.
Dominoes effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, considered that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly afraid of a "domino" effect in a region that has been weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto power.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say
Only a Security Council decision is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
In response to the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu said that the Kosovo Parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be carried out in coordination with Western countries.
Bush elicits agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which met on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do all he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures, and Israel must cease its colonization, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap for Peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas were ultimately aimed at a peace agreement that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the key issues.
This term encompasses the three serious issues that are at the heart of the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced by the 1948 conflict from their homes in what is now the State of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a settlement on all points, enumerating, among others, Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to ensuring that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to bring them to an end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two juxtaposed states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received a Bush pledge in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, the Saudi Arabian prince said in an interview with the Arabic-language daily, which is funded by Saudi money.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are pitted against each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Office of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on the Rue Louise, Michel direction Villiers, le Bel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40 and 50 km / h, without blue lights, explained a police spokesman.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, released without registration, i.e. not for public road transport (see below), arrived at very high speed, driven by two youngsters without a helmet.
It rammed the left side of the police car after disregarding its right of way, a policeman continued to explain.
Alcohol checks carried out on passengers are much more negative.
The condition of the car (dented fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main department for public security of Val d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers at this stage of the investigation by the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this moped reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained stuck in each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers, a rumour was circulating that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without giving any help to the two youngsters.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also rule out any serious errors concerning this matter.
According to one police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation and must be handled very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely distraught policeman limping.
Two more tried to revive one of the teenagers, the fourth telephoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly built up around the event and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police had left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the forces of law and order.
They then threw stones at the policemen, with which they injured them.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court ’ s Bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights advocates, and lawyers over the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the meeting.
Further demonstrations allegedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers ’ movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis and Amal, whose president called on the population to send flowers to judges who had spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf ’ s promise no longer applies
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, explained the magistrate of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf ’ s promise to hand over command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the state of emergency was invoked, declared Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first presidential term ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Moreover, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a whereabouts by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which permitted contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the spiral, still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of female pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 years using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are now carefully planned.
With one out of five couples calculated precisely to the month, and if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has set several records due to its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organised and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical section that will soon house the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module "Laboratories".
But they must be able to be supplied with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on board the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew started to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded like accordions, was damaged by a jammed cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the Discovery space shuttle for an inspection walk and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best Spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was assisted by a second Spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in an insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, was invented and constructed by the astronauts on board the station.
When the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle today, presumably for Wednesday's return flight to Earth.
The EADS title on the stock exchange sanctioned
Following the Aviation and Defence Group ’ s announcement that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to address the A400M backlog, EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 to reflect the delays in the maiden flight of the aircraft caused by the slow development of the A400M engine.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion are for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
These costs will force EADS to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, without further detail, he added.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS ’ business performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 carrier.
The first delivery of the A400M to the French Army was initially scheduled for October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballots will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin ’ s United Russia party.
After a very closed campaign, it confirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters on public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is being kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the frontrunner of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which an overwhelming victory is looming.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, he gave no sign of anything and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favourite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest, transparent and open elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone astray.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennady Ziouganov says there had never been such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin.
Following the suppression of demonstrations last weekend, applies to former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrating was sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer continues to ban visitors.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much broader questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The Official Gazette announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Ministers?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party that will elect the government and president?
Whatever it is going to be, in parliamentary or presidential elections, power will triumph.
That is tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their destiny, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St Petersburg State University goes even further back: civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has returned to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily relinquish the personal responsibility that they briefly demonstrated after the USSR ’ s disintegration.
Why think about it?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including business.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) head the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why consider?
Those in power are not so bad why they replace?
A heavy souvenir
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be consulted until now, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and name-related, i.e. when consulted by a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states in charge of its administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
Once the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening-up took effect yesterday.
Delicate information
Historians ’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to investigate, above all, the deportation of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as alleged homosexuality or the intellectual disability of some victims of deportation.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal inquiries in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the research center for anti-Semitism of the technical University of Berlin, had explained 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Mutual trade between India and Europe currently stands at around EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe is already worth some 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free-trade pact will take the two economies forward enormously, and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, added the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange 47 billion euros worth of goods and 10 billion euros worth of services every year, said Daniéle Smadja, Chair of the European Commission ’ s Delegation in New Delhi this week, regretting that reciprocal trade has not yet reached its potential. EU and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday to contain the current recurrent anxiety about the terms of the loan and announced an offer of £10 billion at a 5.75% base rate for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to allay fears that conditions in the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its savings during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The bank further explains that in this way on 6 December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the real estate tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open markets operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it stands ready to take further measures to maintain the day-to-day differentiation of interest rates on interbank loans at its basic interest rate.
The day-to-day differential between banks was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has stabilised at 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis last summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to fines that had dissuaded banks from drawing them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous interest rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the proposals of PS on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The text, drawn up within the framework of a socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which amounted to 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the floating TIP, a transport cheque or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s televised report on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS parliamentarians, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all of its proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the correction of finances, which was examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors of the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival, the movement in America, according to Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festivals.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he became director of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he ’ s ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn ’ s work side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival.
We have chosen Philadelphia as the market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival back to life in Grand Park, Chicago, after making a name for itself in the festival world in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated gross tax revenues of $9.8 million and $11.8 million respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn ’ s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours takes place in urban green spaces, ” says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order to simultaneously give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is approximately half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy, ” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to abandon the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", roughly equivalent to 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
Charlie Walker and Charles Attal are the partners of C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards.
Montreal meets Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if none other than the Terminator opposes it.
These teasing attempts belong to the delegate tasks.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer what you think is the best, "he says.
The run on the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, advancing cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful screening at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is featured on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a final year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the coming final year, the rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that from a purely statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who, due to the lack of safe equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the appreciating trend towards profitable assets.
Consequently, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will tend to show a more lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, above all because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US central bank, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chair of Sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a risky time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 points on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional annual pension fund subsidy, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could change somewhat this year, mainly due to the final year of the rally, which will take place in the second week of December, immediately after the Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, price volatility would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the current market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a possible deviation from the index values, the extent of which would depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that they will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values, which are to advance the Ibex to new maximums.
Solana from Intermoney affirms that this year it is the big values.
The expert would count the two big banks and some real estate companies among the value “winners ”, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the appropriate time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go along with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit, the expert said.
Regarding the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, in the last half of the year, periodic consumption will determine the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only present in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been declining only in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, it lifted the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year rally to date.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will also be a final year rally.
Popular will have its 200 banks open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically efficient regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first banking group to take the plunge, extending the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and to schedule Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations between the bank and the unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement whereby 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, although not for the customers.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which will adjust to business hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And this is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can accommodate the customers of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as those of large department stores.
The bank plans to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as the opening hours are not new, but changed.
To this end, the Bank will remodel the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, while adapting them to the individual customer profiles of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The bank ’ s representative in charge, Ángel Rivera, asserted that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would be accompanied by increased staffing, as a branch would no longer require six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even have additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the empirical values were positive, said Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name of Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The BBVA model will not be used in these PopularMax branches, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
Rivero explains that we do not want to be a competitor for our customers.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the market. Telecinco ’ s channel had increased its value by two times that of its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he stated.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces his previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill now reaches €4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value amounts to 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies has increased, to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act in terms of stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level still seems uncertain.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV station to receive more than 1000 million gross proceeds from advertising revenue this year, according to Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from television business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
According to analysts, the main factor contributing to Telecinco ’ s comparatively better performance on the stock market is the company ’ s high payout ratio to date: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría generated a 100 percent dividend payment.
However, Vasile asserts that the ratio may still vary after the acquisition of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, even though it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated considerably more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already increased by acquiring 33% of Endemol ’ s shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: focuses on its high effective yield and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) has a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reset expectations in both cases in the face of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Senate vote on the project ’ s supplementary / amendments, the Government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both provisions by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the members of the Congress and the Senate who, in their negotiations and votes, had aimed at establishing the best possible regulation that would guarantee the security of investors and regulate the activities of individual entrepreneurs in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which is redefining the investment services regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control rights of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will enable financial advice to be provided both to specialised firms and to natural or legal persons, and will also contribute to the establishment of new financial services firms (ESIS), the advisory firms which will be merged with investment and securities brokerage firms.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for executing financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems for securities transactions and the systems for internationalising trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focal points of their company profile, the confrontation and forms of risk management in the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV ’ s control task.
In retrospect, the Congressional Economic Commission made provision for further changes, with the decision that the titled bond must now be considered as a complex financial resource for the investor due to its high level of risk confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis (US Mortgage Crisis).
It also took advantage of the entry into force of the directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of qualified economists; 30 years after 1977, the regulation was adopted restricting the working areas reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on behalf of third parties, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer his services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition to several investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The Eurostat inflation indicator, used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union, shows average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made ahead of time using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
The Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned, however, that the pre-determined indicator would serve only as a benchmark and would therefore not have to comply with the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while assuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good, Spain ’ s inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also said that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years with Northern Rock
The stocks of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half after the bank had asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September of last year due to the crisis, and they now amount to only 12,000 million pounds (this corresponds to 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the bank ’ s assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably in two and a half months from the loss of client confidence, and that, despite the government ’ s 100% guarantee that the money will be safe, will continue to fall until the crisis is over.
The Virgin company, which would continue to operate the group under the Virgin Money brand after the acquisition, will have to raise about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire the exact £18 billion needed to achieve its target of £30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his conspicuous advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel GBP 50,000 million (approximately EUR 70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its objective.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are also involved, as its preferred bidder to get it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana Arrested on Alleged Suspicion of Participation in Urban Corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was exposed this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and then chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and according to information from the radio station Cadena SER could be the original mastermind of the frame-up.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week, was accused.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, Member of Parliament Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client ’ s place of residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report that Morales allegedly paid a contract to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the construction of a 200 hectare area was decided.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the coming general elections in Toledo and, in case of an electoral victory of the Socialists, will take over the office of President of Congress.
This is what José Blanco, PSOE organizational secretary, and Bono announced at the press conference following a meeting with Zapatero at the party ’ s headquarters today.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, if the Mancha politician wins for the Socialists in the upcoming election, he would appear to be running for Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress president, who announced last November 15 that he would not run in the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead campaign for climate protection at the university.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the head of the government had continuously pressed for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the post of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he does take over, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect, not of insult or shouting, in order to make it more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; for example, the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work, suggesting that he did not want to give the appearance of having already taken office, as otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate mercilessly criticises both the sceptics of climate change and those who put social and political debate on the issue, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a quandary about the actions, or non-actions, of his government, which has been instrumental in ensuring that Spain is at the forefront within the EU of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, which sectors are responsible, and why his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
Furthermore, he is now obliged to explain to the Spanish people in no uncertain terms the measures he intends to take to combat climate change.
Which firms will be affected, what behaviour of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what economic consequences will result from this.
More precisely, who must sacrifice himself and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such declarations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be used against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE ’ s proposed gasoline “cent ” seemed so strategically dangerous to Zapatero ’ s election that he felt compelled to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, the task now is to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the politician who is otherwise so suitable for election campaigns does not have to talk, accuse, or demand, but instead to pursue the demanding expenditure of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
This can only happen, however, if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in future or that we may refresh ourselves with only one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana because of an alleged involvement in an urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, and the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the mayor ’ s secretary and a hotel operator were taken into custody on suspicion of urban violations, it was said today from investigative circles.
The town council was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, where he still resides today, surrounded by numerous agents who also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction supervision Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the searches carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land were to be redesigned for urban development projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4 000 apartments on the site after receiving illegal commissions from the local administration during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six detainees were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles is also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The president and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have been part of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigation will be carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose representatives carried out 11 searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a poultry industry known locally, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, with more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which had to be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots in Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the direct marketing sector; and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a prize, a designation of other names with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, incidentally, is at the head of the PISA study), which takes a position on the remark published in the same newspaper on November 18, coincidentally on the day the edition of which contained the criticism of Blackburn ’ s book.
The subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the Jokela school tragedy.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate, who in his messages quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to adopt a more critical attitude towards Plato and suggested that Plato ’ s teachings be removed from the secondary school curricula for philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of the law and would be punished with six months' imprisonment.
But if you rob a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 Euros, the theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data entails imprisonment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD of a movie from the Internet.
F. Trafficking in copyright-protected films which have not been authorised by the authors will be subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to the activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was conducted using a tomographic reference magnetic analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Brain Research Center Life & Brain in Bonn, activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and the other participant failed.
The researchers could see that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answers and therefore received the same salary; but if one of them received twice as much, it also resulted in stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her official seat is in the public prosecutor ’ s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her post with one eye, both crying and laughing, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are still at large, namely the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the former Bosnian Serbo, Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on a list that the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach uses as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the speed of a political thriller in her quest to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
Motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves high costs, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an policyholder.
This agreement is stipulated in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company shall receive the agreed insurance premium and in return shall be obliged to submit the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which is made up of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of the statistics, so that higher premiums are also due if the risk of accidents is higher.
As a result, both 25 + year-olds and women will have to contribute less, as statistics show that their prudence means that these groups have a lower accident rate.
The same is true of married people, who, according to statistical data and therefore also to the conviction of companies, are less prone to accidents than single people.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle impair the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
Insurance companies must take a whole series of points into account when setting the premium.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
At this point we list the most important points to consider when selecting an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance- but also a price-oriented choice.
There are numerous obstacles to choosing low-cost insurance for people under 25 years of age, such as low driving experience and a young driving licence.
Even if it would be best to take out comprehensive insurance for an ideal insurance cover, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a comprehensive insurance with excess, so that the services of a comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount of the damage himself.
The amount will be determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the smaller the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain ’ s main representative at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external damage caused by accidents, but not against damage to his own car.
Moreover, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is up to you to reduce your insurance costs, so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty involves an increase in the tariff in question.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving experience.
Therefore, it makes most sense to opt for fully comprehensive insurance with excess.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the beginner's anxiety has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable to take out comprehensive insurance for a married customer who does not have children, of course only if the financial situation of the person in question allows it.
On the part of insurers, married couples with children are considered to have the lowest accident rate and their contributions are accordingly low.
In this case, a fully comprehensive insurance with excess (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit note, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which does not start until the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with excess (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be said that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it entails high costs, which require a thorough choice to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the quarterfinals in Milan
Next Tuesday, Milan FC and Celtic Glasgow will battle for the spot they lack in San Siro to reach their respective goals before the final stages of the Champions League are over. Italians need the spot to get to the top of their group, as the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan FC will have to compete at the FIFA Club ’ s World Cup in Japan, where they will compete for the first time on the 13th in the semi-finals for the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of all the others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. Italians will not want to speculate at home that the Keltik Glasgow would be first in the group in case of a victory and thus would have a better starting position in the second round.
The team of Gordon Strachan might even be able to qualify after a defeat of Shakhtar FC. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points tie the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2: 1), but could win the second game (2: 0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to spoil the evening for the Scot. Again, they hope to reach the second round of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the same round by a goal from Kaka in injury time (1: 0) and by a zero tie on the first leg.
While Shakhtar FC is waiting for Rossoneri to win, the team will have to concentrate on their own game, as both the reaching of the eighth finals and his membership in UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, could win a third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000 in front of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver, Canada.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place Vancouver stadium that the atmosphere in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people attended the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video was shown on the history of the band, which had caused a sensation at the end of the nineties.
The reunification and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album containing their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on the stage, which Posh Spice ’ s husband, English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the crowds that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had never seen our dressing room, so I am very curious to see what he will think of the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 caused the group to disband two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world had changed, that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And that ’ s why I thought why not, so I ’ m happy to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the split of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone now liked each other very much.
Nevertheless many things have changed since the last appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special aircraft, according to a report by the TV station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five together have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be on stage in Madrid on 23rd December.
New fears over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia ’ s gas exports to the European Union (EU) pass through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia ’ s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be billed more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom ’ s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Anatoly Kinakh, Minister of Economy of Ukraine, told Reuters.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
As a result, exports to Western Europe have fallen, driving up prices sharply.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world ’ s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a member of the supervisory board. outside
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish National Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the qualifications, experience and authorisations required to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor ’ s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines from the criminal record extract, which helps employers with inspections in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel documents, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines to a large extent prior to recruitment, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland ’ s Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely ” that pre-employment investigations of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests by the NHS are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had difficulty identifying those employees who were on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures had been largely respected by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
This includes passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I wanted to carry out this work in the light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in liaison with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices were reflected in updated pre-employment screening guidelines for all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.

And Bond, the actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film into the world public eye.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.

The black and white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, has won two awards for best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focal point of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the clash, singer Joe Strummer, received the award for best documentary film.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg ’ s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honoured. "
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had detained 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant and on clerics and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world ’ s largest petroleum processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to an Interior Ministry statement, says that 18 of those detained belonged to a cell headed by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militants have planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees planned to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join forces with Al Qaeda militias that want to fight Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretical by hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many Saudi clerics as working with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - target foreign residential areas, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This was a huge effort by the security forces over the last... five months," an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims, who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus may give a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles a distant twin of the Earth even more than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists now believe.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rate of rotation, Venus embarked on a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is stripped of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricanes, strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency ’ s Venus Express spacecraft, which examined the planet for a year, offer a sobering view of how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said, "It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material will be checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nonetheless, the Republican presidential candidate eventually agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotape and submit questions to send to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party ’ s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party that is about to go into next year ’ s election.
It is unknown, as are the CNN producers who helped support the debate by selecting YouTube clips to show to the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest being devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the center.
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to operate a voting disc when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tops of approval as the candidates were strictly talking about the borders.
The hottest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of having yielded to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two particularly argued as questioners whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (would give the illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, have been able to catch up on this issue.
Neither man has a serious chance of being nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration trail earlier and harder than others.
On immigration, at least, the candidates generally share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance of illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
As a result, Giuliani took the view that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would endorse them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee ’ s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul ’ s recent donation successes and his applause in Wednesday ’ s debate.
These two have shot up from nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party convincingly from the outset with a winning message about America ’ s greatness and a wink at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour Pain
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, it is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician ’ s Paris hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman has disguised donations to Britain ’ s ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under other people ’ s names, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the embattled Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When, two months ago, the prime minister evaded the call for an election, stupidly insulting the British intelligentsia by claiming that opinion polls did not influence that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute leader of Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-dreaded Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a ailing bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have turned business associations against the government.
The fiscal loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals launched an Upper House uprising in protest at cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labor ’ s general secretary (and its former vicarious director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably headed for resignation.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually restrain their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there long, that delay is over: the civil service is beginning to leak; cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown ’ s position is particularly difficult, because, unlike other leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are linked to decisions taken by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair ’ s misfortunes – as in the long “money-for-nobility ” investigation of political party funding – voters may assume that he was.
Still Brown ’ s situation is not quite as bad as she looks
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown ’ s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and easily brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish any public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be so, but it was not for him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham ’ s agreement, but not that it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labor ’ s chief financier, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But, so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the full measure of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a radical reform of political party funding.
That would require the Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and eventually give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
Conservatives now have clear leadership in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through undeniable righteousness and solid competence.
Cardsharks
Is America ’ s Credit Card Market Contagious?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins whirl around excitedly.
Now that America ’ s housing market is ailing, predators are targeting the country ’ s credit-card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the deductions and the default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either not recoverable or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee from its US consumer financing, in part due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in America ’ s private-insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of the card losses; the number of filings (and thus default charges) would rise again, whether or not general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the expenditure quantities for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the housing credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers are more likely to take up credit card debt now that home loans are drying up.
The card issuers, however, look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They may even be advantageous for ticket issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decline when the value of the property is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much more quickly and flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We will not wake up one day and completely reassess the loans, ” says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden shortfall in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are far more real.
If lower house prices and credit reduction push America into recession, industry will no doubt face a grimmer future.
Keep looking out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron ’ s former Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their case on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded not guilty to seven cases of telecommunications fraud for allegedly colluding with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The trial was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before the U.S. District Court judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron ’ s collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow ’ s attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment of the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent frame-up with Fastow and his former top adviser, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped to drag the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its holding in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Koper ’ s control acquired the bank ’ s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow wrongly represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its stake in the subsidiary.
But, in fact, the $20 million went to British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison term in Louisiana ’ s federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at large on a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation ’ s seventh-largest corporation, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer obscure billions of dollars in debt or make faltering enterprises seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron ’ s founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in Enron ’ s collapse.
Skilling will serve a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay ’ s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became null and void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls' Royce 'engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumerism staged in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition booths hoping to interest newly monetized Russians in everything from mahogany paneled yachts to diamond coated barbecues that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's small change compared to us," he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft after the United States."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas was during its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and flocked to Europe, where they were considered materialistic, ” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high-flyers of the 1970 ’ s and the Japanese of the 1990 ’ s, Russians are emerging as the world ’ s most visible generous financiers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted a conference of the luxury industry to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
She attended the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
While walking through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red "veteran" carpet with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers willing to stand in traffic for several hours in order to visit a winding warehouse that, shamelessly, juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke billiard tables, Dubai apartments, and Gund Teddy Bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt, a picture made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course Russians are more interested in Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from ostentatious logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, thronged through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made from silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that supplies high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the garish orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said that he had sold three grills for a Rolls Royce Phantom that resembled linked chain arm tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four-person replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-seater garage."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red telephone booths based on the British model, which were crammed with mountains of fake millions of dollars bills.
Azad Karryev, the company ’ s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passersby paused to throw the piles of money around, to snap mobile phone photos while leaning back in the midst of the surroundings, by friends, or simply to pocket a few million.
"You see, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Botched surgery suspected at death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier Restaurant and watched an ambulance stop at White Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the van of the medical hearse come up," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine whether she died from a trial conducted by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon who was unidentified by the police and who worked in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help shed light on a mysterious death that has sent grief through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," Mr McCarthy said of Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, and that she left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankov, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That ’ s one of the possibilities, ” said Walsh.
"It is an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was being questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the small front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading down to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
“She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes that the Central Bank will lower interest rates lead to a rise in world equity markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were encouraged by reassuring comments from the vice-chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number two bank chairman of Ben Bernanke, said that policymakers needed to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm dire markets in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions of late September and October ”.
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is prepared to step in and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped reassure Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S & P 500 index rose 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 Index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK defaults.
Germany ’ s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France ’ s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined by strong demand for a three-month auction of European Central Bank guarantees granted to European commercial banks at a respectable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank, and the European Central Bank to inject more capital into London ’ s money markets rose when credit tensions saw the three months of “Libor ” lending rates between UK banks rise by 6.59% to their highest level since late September, after a steady increase since November 21.
England confronted with decision on the testimony of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, at least under this particular title, is here to help head coach Peter Moore and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not for some part-time ones.
Whoever does not get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is certainly.
It is never easy to pin down precisely what enables a person to reach the top of their profession, while someone else never gets beyond the bottom, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that the choice is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps be asked in another area, such as whether John Edwards or 'Tubby' Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but chances are there.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wickets and a racket must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the selector's eyes is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind blows into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets, each with 33 runs, to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to become a major test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is still perhaps underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut instincts for Shah ’ s greater experience of Bopara ’ s youthful enthusiasm after another discussion in today ’ s network session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test, debut at Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and an excellent record against turned balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his stride that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-wise joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything at a cricket ground and his attitude away from it was summed up when he recently rolled over a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better outfield player, he skims his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not look good after all, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and to Combat Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping that the city will return to normality.
Some even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was in operation with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Quaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how safe it would be now."
They say that the Mahdi ’ s army has stopped killing people, ” he said, referring to the Shi ’ a militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al- ‘ Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be withdrawn at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that a local, US-backed militia had helped drive Al Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe, who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That ’ s why I returned today, ” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop build-up and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" armed and in cooperation with the American military defending their neighborhoods.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed widespread suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
“We were fine until al ’ Maliki visited Syria and the government pushed the Iraqis to stop granting visas to force them to return to Iraq, ” said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia neighborhoods and vice versa, creating many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field does the Saarlanders squeeze the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I declared for the 50th time to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan is self-mocking posters of the smallest federal state on the occasion of its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland ’ s education system, which ranks fifth in the Bildungsmonitor of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
For example, the universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded by the French in 1948.
Until today, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
But also the Landeskinder brings Saarland in an above average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the High School.
"The Saarland uses the vocational education and training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people obtains their entitlement to study at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the German average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also comparatively well developed.
In terms of population, the dual study programmes are the second-best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering science subjects.
“After the first study in Pisa, we initiated a number of reforms in general schools, ” says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that children can start learning earlier, the last day care centre is free of charge - a model that has been copied by other federal states in the meantime.
Only future comparative studies will show whether pupils ’ performance improves sustainably.
At Pisa in 2003, the share of at-risk students fell from 29 to 20 percent.
On the whole, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders foreign language knowledge is not measured with Pisa - in this range one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez Changes the Clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, a new law adjusts clocks to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other reasons, the decision was based on the fact that the United States had imposed the division into timezones on the world at full time.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do that just for the sake of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform that oil-country citizens will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The controversy was triggered by Uribe ’ s decision to withdraw Chávez ’ s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia over the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in Venezuela's face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is on everyone ’ s lips.
A new cell phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you stop your mouth) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain ’ s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America Summit by the constant heckling of the left-wing populist and had fumbled him.
Germans threatened with wage decline in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Boeckler Foundation, employees could expect 2007 real on less on the payroll than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price spurts for food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in terms of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is right and reasonable in the current situation.
However the federal agency for work may not come again into embarrassment to have to ask with the federation for credits or subsidies, the SPD in a quotation to politician.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the food and petroleum product price explosion had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, just like they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometres, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup" theory, lightning created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there has ever been life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is around a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees prevail.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of Earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a completely different development, is the basic question of Esa ’ s mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties, no probe was used for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a research team headed by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres is almost as large.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the Sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets formed under quite similar conditions.
On both sides water accumulated, which remained on earth in oceans, but was lost on Venus into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it accounts for the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel ’ s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany ’ s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world with a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but defended Merkel from the accusation that she was pursuing a new policy towards China.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional One China ’ s policy.
China knows that too, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier deplored the Union ’ s “window dressing policy ” in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama ’ s reception in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, China ’ s leaders not only unloaded German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries ’ foreign ministries.
China ’ s leader, Wen Jiabao, has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama ’ s reception as a mistake.
Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position, saying that China was opposed to European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in an official capacity.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to sever Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots as in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being discharged into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters fired shotguns at the police: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that social explosives do not build up in our country and explode in violence.
We have to take this seriously, "he said to the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal, state and local governments have already worked hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, this is already showing its first successes."
However, it is too early to sound the all-clear.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban planning and sociological problems in German suburbs, as there were in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police over the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts on the part of the German government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background was "above average".
Above all, more apprenticeships must be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We have to give young people a perspective. ”
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat warned: "But nevertheless we must be careful."
One had to give the young people "quickly the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, the night remained largely quiet in the Parisian suburb of Villiers, le Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter with spotlights flew over the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, a contingent of around 1000 security personnel has been providing peace and quiet.
The police will take action as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots during the night of Tuesday.
On the following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to initial findings by the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor ’ s unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content – and that nothing more can be expected of her.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was muddy and lacking in content, one must say: not here - not in the country, which would finally have to be governed by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are after.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented for all how true their reproach is.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees to foreign policy and remains impartial even there.
Take climate protection, for example: it praises itself unreservedly for the resolutions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty would have failed the CDU leader two years ago.
Now it clings to the cliché that the upswing reaches the people.
In doing so, she is tarnishing her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than whitewashing the world.
But domestic problems are marginal in Angela Wolke ’ s empire.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses left over for this.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the child allowance.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on strange terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the Republican presidential candidates ’ YouTube debate, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, engage in a tough battle – and now have to fear an outsider.
The tension of the candidates discharges itself already with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of having turned New York into a "refuge for illegal immigrants."
The latter, for his part, counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," replies Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates launch an attack: because the Republican base still lacks a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
The self-shot 30 seconds of videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keyword givers.
"With this kind of isolationism we let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is being vigorously read by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn waterboarding as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important themes of the campaign now lie beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are vaunted and future tax increases rejected, applause flares up in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney remorsefully declares, pleading in front of the grassroots and television audiences that he was still one of the proponents of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, begins to wallow when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistan ’ s ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This brings to an end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan ’ s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby yielding to international pressure, particularly from the USA.
Eight years after coming to power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing-in, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country ’ s Supreme Court, which Musharraf filled with weighty lawyers following the declaration of a state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, in the Northern Tribal Region, five soldiers were killed and four injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany ’ s supergroup of the seventies is making music again: the three members of Harmonia took their consoles to a concert in Berlin.
For the revival a recording from her great time "Live 1974" is released.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The appointed sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius enthroned in a white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, seen from the auditorium, Hans Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends in with a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays music again has caused quite a stir among Krautrock fans.
Whereby one may reveal here: Targeted inquiries resulted in the fact that the name floated through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lastingly, in order to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why should not the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially as what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more popular in England and America than at home.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo in 2003, one could see questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their laudatory speech, astonishment knew no bounds.
At concerts Michael Rother later sat on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in foreign lands is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far lower effectiveness than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother helped out with Kraftwerk for a short while and afterwards gained a reputation as guitarist with Neu!, at that time perhaps the most radical German group.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster “Musicians in Exile ” to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as fleeing Communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
Rather in a sharp-edged artistic existence.
Allegedly also a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name was found in the bulky garbage.
Many things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as relaxed and humble as the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Picking brushwood was not only for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-setting of almost 50 heads, as someone imagines.
From Rother came the desire to push Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (Flaming Hearts).
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as their very own German contribution to lively music.
Neu! has been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the Briton, alto punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Love Parade, inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of Krautrock influences on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills in the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the strangest sounds in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of confusingly wired devices serve to create legends.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums in order to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical enthusiasts.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, there is coughing and whispering under clouds of sound and singing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never a rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here calls "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia will not let this disturb her.
The most self-evident thing is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or bring fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" again two films deal with the Balkan war.
But neither is convincing.
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action and banging or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties the last time, because too many nice and trivial roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drive out the desire to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to "The Hunting Party - Wenn der Jäger zum Gejagten wird" (Why do today's film titles always have to be as long and confused as train drivers' collective bargaining agreements?) perhaps to look at.
He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek portrayal: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has had his best times long ago, but who himself, as a ruin-like monument to his downfall, has preserved considerable remnants of his former charm.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party", together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" ("Murderous Peace"), which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murderous Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not presented here as the sole root of all evil, the TV-flat film gets all too quickly lost in blaring and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but instead with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is a perfect example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at a different time with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union with Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the woods to do something that the military cannot do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt isn't just let the run-down cynic be with his heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to charge him with a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"The Hunting Party" will finally go down the drain if the reporters manage within the last five minutes in a time-lapse procedure what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not managed in five years: Catch the war criminal and leave it to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree for once) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But good intentions and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht ’ s poem comes to mind.
Regarding the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk, it says: "With compassion I see the swollen brow veins, indicating how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swellheads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war films.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all of Iraq ’ s films were Hollywood ’ s big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South African film.
It is almost always the case that when a star drifts around the trouble spots or minefields of the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Many a film will probably still mature - the now considered classics Vietnam, the works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were at that time by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the thoughtlessness it takes to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good films.
Perhaps one has to have the sarcastically distanced artist view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia. "
Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The mayor ’ s retreat from Hamburg ’ s bid for the Summer Olympics has met with strong criticism from politicians and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in assessing opportunities.
On Wednesday, the Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce (Handelskammer Hamburg), Hans Griff Jörg Schmidt, called a renunciation "not good for the business location".
No other project has developed such great motivational forces in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain the momentum of sport policy to the same extent."
Mr. Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach "based on a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg ’ s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation", said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the sports federation ’ s decision, expected at the beginning of December, to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have planned so far."
Nevertheless, von Beust said the dream was not over for all time.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts ’ statements.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer be applying for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to miss an opportunity by burying the plans already at this time", HSB's President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A renouncement of the application stands besides in contradiction to the statement of the head of senate on the occasion of a receipt to the plenary meeting of the general German university sport federation.
There von Beust called Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD parliamentary group accused the Senate of not having used up valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years, because it put on the map Olympia and excluded the housing construction ”, said the SPD on delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Kleiner Grasbrook had always called for integrated planning for the Olympics and subsequent residential use, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event" factor.
At the time, the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had generated a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue raisonné.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo "Stockholm" boxes listed there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo "Boxes of 1968", internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo" Boxes, which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo "Boxes of the Stockholm type", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, in New York, Warhol created his first "Brillo" boxes, painted wooden boxes based on the red and blue and white design of the "Brillo" soap powder cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited – with Warhol ’ s agreement – hundreds of Brillo ’ s boxes made of cardboard: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo ’ s cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo ’ s wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which, at the time, were authorised as originals, and rightly entered into the history of art and auctions under the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them have obtained more than 100 000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén ’ s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has examined the six museum owned Brillo ’ s boxes as well as three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were produced in 1968 in Stockholm: their pressboard panels were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a paint roller without primer - it is also not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo and Boxes," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not reach another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies / exhibition material."
As early as July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" raised about soap powders and boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained inexorably silent.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Previously, soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen or so soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them stood trial on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly break away with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops closed off the area around the posh hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor, Norberto Gonzales, condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for big demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed for months by allegations of corruption.
Manila ’ s financial district was already the scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours because of the army ’ s refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
