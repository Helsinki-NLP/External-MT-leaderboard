Republican strategy to prevent Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy for the need to fight against electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die due to the fall of a lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of U.S. governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that complicated the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections that saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right of vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photo, in addition to a American citizenship proof.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of anticipated vote, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal backgrounds.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required the voters to present an identity document with photo.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities have rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported laws in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to keep in mind that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people in voting age, do not have any identity documents with photographs issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, a 25% of African Americans, a 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, a 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and a 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 don’t have an identity document with photography.
And there is more.
In many states students, the voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004 no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic voting.
Two out of three Spanish voters seem to support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of people and groups to create a service of help to the voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved that the registration rate of new voters fell in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the voting period by advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state voters.
In the Spanish, exactly the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, the white, which represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this sense, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Fiscal Ministry has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage could be partially reduced.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the submission of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party character of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report demonstrates that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to the presidency.
It is too early to assure if these legislative changes on the scale of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you do the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents, sometimes, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to make useless medical interventions.
It is a more than enough reason to make men, already reticent of themselves, doubt about whether the detection tests should be done or not.
Do you do the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, a large index of infections was detected among the sampling groups, so it is difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
On the other hand, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a 12-year-old follow-up, also demonstrated that there is between 30 and 40% of chances of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his cancer. it should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, in which case it should be opted rather for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men to whom a cancer has been detected are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive and does not lead to a risk for their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you a treatment.
We are increasingly determining accurate criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend the test in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and contras of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise, at least, to 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that around 10% of cancers are inherited.
Many others remain completely unexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly damages people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful data: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favour the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Carrots should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for smoking, drought or salad can cause the formation of cancer substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the moment, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer was observed, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each one with his doctor.
“Doing the detection test does not cause cancer.”
The Higgs Boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and with reason.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is partition of the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what’s more, it’s the particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not completely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Additionally, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that yes, although there are still no more data to be completely secure.
In any case, let’s assume that it’s about Higgs, as the chances of getting wrong seem to be few.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to infringe that rule and do not try it too much, because it will end up becoming harmful.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli’s principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state”; a “state” which consists, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify the particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists that has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the site The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "power particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be emparented.
These bosons, I could emphasize here, are not the exotic beasts we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinaryly banal boson: the photon or the “light particle” that acts as the “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “desordins” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a stain.
In this "disorder" a electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "power-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it’s another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be “disordered” so that this boson appears.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field.To activate it, it is necessary to get to extremely high energies, a bit as if it was a ice pool in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
Therefore, an immense particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great hadron collisioner is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogue with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do so, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stick to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations “contribute” to? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutine the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
Many, on their part, want to be found, because the smallest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that taps certain hole in the model.
This, we have to say, has still enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms around 80% of the matter in the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong by saying that it won’t have any.
At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution their work would provoke.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who elaborated the first continuous laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962, at the beginning the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light captor in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics.
Although it was not his original intention at all, this captor now serves as a "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but it’s never known...
Palliative Care: The Best Way to Die – Le Devoir
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in La Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"I had been given five years of life, but I'm already carrying seven," she tells, making a pass, falling in her bed at the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which she arrived the previous day.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has caused you damage: an enormous weakness that prevents you from going alone to the bathroom and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Courageous, he even gets to smile, to talk to the strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medications and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man stands,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Return to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“This depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working on palliative care, the great moments take place in the heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offer the “curative” care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made her children discover.
“I have good kids,” he added.
“I don’t have any more desires in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
It is expected, in the coming days, a last visit of his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
They are palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s very little, because we know that we all will end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dead are offered mouth sweats with brandy or pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics no longer control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both the patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his clothes while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
“Since six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick of cancer,” Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
A 53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center comes from their home and a 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply don’t have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a sick man reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several bodies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the palliative care society at home of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in Quebec’s health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
“Recently,” she reports, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergencies suffering great pain without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die alone because they don't receive adequate care."
And in parallel, many oncologists stand with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when she left an exhaustive chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
“But she had told me there was nothing else to do!”
There is no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank their caregivers that they have not addressed their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the unleashed disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want them to relieve me.”
The realization of this reporting has been possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canada’s health research institutes.
Large Real Estate Scandal in Quebec
Officials of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafiosos are part of.
A “industry” that came too expensive to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
“It’s curious how the system pulverizes once we’ve hunted the big media,” ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, Deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the 2011 scandal outbreak, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation of road contracts related malversations in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had not consented more than to delay.
The “Duchesneau Report” established a direct link between the industry, the clandestine financing of the parties and corruption between officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts of staying with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already caught two mayor,” adds, while hoping to get to “demost the existing strategies behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of interventors, researchers and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police officers of the "Marteau Squad", who, since 2009, have made the Montreal's "cartel of the shell" moderate when it comes to contracting.
These last weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial record of the accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post of mayor in Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has been packed repeated surrender in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers from the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused confusion by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito distributed money to the right and sinist during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for former deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The Inflation of Cost Contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and suburns from the construction sector companies for a total of $736,000, all this in exchange for cutting-edge contracts whose costs inflated.
Other roadside officials have admitted that they received money for inflating the invoices between 30% and 40% in terms of false extra.
In addition, a party organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately making the fat look to a parallel budget and filled his arches with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elect policies to make the alarm sound.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of the election campaign was dirty money.
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she throw “from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by worms, to stop the gangrene and fishing the guilty.”
And he adds that the process is “doorsome, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but it would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his part, declares that “the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but is worried above all about the role of the “elected politicians in the current strategy.”
Estimating in a 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it ironizes: “I’ve been told that that’s nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to 100 dollars to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as the electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It recommends a complete review of the system of granting public contracts and financing of the parties: "We can't fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to reconstruct the house with a stronger base, with more controls and laws."
If this story accompanies the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
PSG is not the FC Barcelona.
This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day by day next to you.
Technical staff has contributed a lot to me too.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I am not calming.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preforming center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I’ve always advanced to giant steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Recruiters are used to playing high-level matches this summer.
Every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is supported by adjunct like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.
Nowadays, there is no one in the League 1 and is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In the 1st League, Lyon has taken us off the position of leader.
We are on the emboscade.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have ranked ourselves for the eighth final with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to get the round of final eighth.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget.
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, this is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means for that project to be concrete.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season we did not get far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended with 79 points.
With 79 points we should have been champions.
But another team, Montpellier, had a fairly better season.
I think this year will be the best.
Even if the big teams like Marsella, Lyon and the Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media is expecting more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things that reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, hasn’t managed to rank for final eight, and they’ve also invested a lot!
In view of the invested amounts, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage on the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well the previous season, have seen themselves “impulsed” by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s success.
It is better to say that we have a “Zlatandependence”.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he sets a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of the League 1.
And he has demonstrated in all the teams for which he has passed that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to progress.
How did you live the 2012 Eurocup with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and went out strengthened.
I have played good matches in the team today.
That’s what I expected from my baptism with the “blue”.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and this is because we have an exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "blue"?
It is getting results.
They are well located in the ranking group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
It was the case of Laurent Blanc.
I don’t want to make comparisons.
Blanc has achieved his goal to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Was the match (1-1) of October 16 in Spain served to set the bases?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing loads between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin’s quota, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to round the $10 today (the quota is censored on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a virtual currencies report published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or purchased (and even sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time accounting book depositors, verificators, currency emitters and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes consist in the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key thing is to write that new transaction in that book.
This passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file-tracking, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers “cogen” the new transaction and add a number before “treating” the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphan, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but are divisible to the hundred million, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the power of calculation.
The network has its heights.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and Bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
“The fault used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoin is not circulating.
In November, the “gigant rebounds” were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book about that currency, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus get cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in the stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to re-evaluate the various risks, today considered high, in case this currency is successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to return to possession of its territory and for the Afghan to choose its future, without expecting anything from us.
We have especially punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former head refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the tayikos.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Western people become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The carriers of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, watched by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban affluence in Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was empty in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His control over the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants overpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making up with government land to sell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting along with huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are unacredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will have to work on those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are avid of mobile phones. TV and its Turkish brochures that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are concerned about reconstructing the provincial militia, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, due to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been arranged or important irrigation systems have been repaid.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumors have spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Western people were there to take over them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak Copper Mines, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavating the immense Buddhist location and staying there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls colleges, children colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of attempting to "give the hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making the help and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO numerous collective interest works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountainous locations.
These work, loose of obtaining local work, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reinforcement, fruit trees, solar protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local, very hard living conditions in those valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters of height.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
This is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish his work.
And almost two years ago Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embryo.
This new initiative has done nothing more than increasing the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "trace his word" and "pisote the right".
Its supporters say it is a measure to finish the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes ruins throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly newspaper Time.
Considering that that resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote my text or I keep the full powers," powers that will supposedly end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they couldn’t make their points of view valid.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent’s clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all considerations, remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law.”
The salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberalists tact it of hypocrisy and consider it not more than a advertising artifacts.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
It refers, in particular, to Article 220, which confers to the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, it’s annoying because “the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be quite less moderate than the current.
For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
“We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be in what extent the civil judges are competent to judge above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it confers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred to the army.
According to the desire of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Neither will civilians be prosecuted in military courts, as human rights defence associations demanded.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticid.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially the freedom of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out yesterday night on television, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the glory of the world, and a sea of salmon.
The promised Earth combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a precious nature.
AIF has identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this “baptism pile” will receive the divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, walking over the waters, the calming of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Dolorosa Way").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretory, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old Town, goes to the Holy Sepulcro on the Mount Gólgota, the place of crucifixion, to the Stone of Untion and to the place of Jesus' burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Ombligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 D.C.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which then will become reality.
A Vertical Journey
The ruins of the Massada Fortress were what remained from a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who devote themselves to the escalation can.
The others can get to this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski station Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great affluence of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski pistes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in the country.
In one trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has lenses of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenirs stores.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there are baths throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salm that easily hold even those who don’t know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmon and healing bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
The Mystery of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he carried a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that carry the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your “self” symbol, the fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newly married who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the crossed.
In the Roman era, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves a lot to wish: in this country around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged to shéquels (currently 1-3$,8 shéquels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it is a subterranean funicular.
Travel in any kind of public transportation costs 6 shéquels and for this price you can travel making transboard for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to Saturday sunrise, markets and stores close and public transport interrupts their work.
On Sunday morning, a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, non-scams fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on cow and bear meat, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falaphel, which are molded garbage balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fooded cats that “pass to their taste” in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The ronroneers love the concurrent places and do not reject the golosines.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
In addition to the insurance, it comes for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will get you out for 15 shéquels a day.
Entrance to the museums costs an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to travel the country and rest were citizens of the U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Earth, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a amount that exceeds 51% of the same 2010 index before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring about the mandatory examination, timers that trade with "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1st, a law enters into force, according to which each employment immigrant must conduct an examination to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to give the exam of the language, if not the one of Russian history and the one of the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
They are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law will not be subject to persons who succeeded in obtaining their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examining centers will operate sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of the Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to submit to the tests in all cities, now more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the Deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed many times to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery.”
Many people talk today about the defense of the rights of labor immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow the problem of immigrant workers to be solved in 90% of the cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who don’t know the language or go through medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find people without scruples who, with the pretext of helping, put a “paid journey” to a scattering and narrow cowboy, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they don’t pay the promised wages,” confirms the head of the Employment Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don’t be angry, boss!
However, many citizens of the Republics of Central Asia who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they don’t know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos who can give themselves the luxury of receiving normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to give the children to eat, not to talk about dressing them, shoes them and buying them what they need for school.
When they get to adolescence, these boys get to work at the first chance.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
“One feels humiliated and inferior.”
However, as regards the law on the language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The exams will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
“Welcome or prohibited the passage to strangers”
Many visitors claim that getting the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for just a thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we generally carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
“We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Go, don’t be crazy, buy a painting.”
The first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was made clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of language knowledge have already been confiscated by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
Fake documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be purchased, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise to immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: shooting during weddings in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and elevate the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s security and anti-corruption committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the weapons possession law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-hand policy".
In the network has appeared an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social shooters organizations, demand that they give up such measures of "righteousness without meaning".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, Russian criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of the year 2012 142 crimes with use of firearms registered in internal organs were committed, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior says the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From Factory to Officials
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High State Mayor.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "Army or military investigation", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were shot by Russian officials and by the same Caucasus,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon",the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are included the weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by officials of law enforcement bodies.
Illegal weapons come for sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were caused premeditately to cover the lack,” an ex-militar commented.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“Now they have spread private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute underwire weapons to the black market, including the Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of black market is counterfeiting.
A large number of weapons and ammunition machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” the former military explains.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal weapons supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was drawn up in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market has arrived there "for the fault of officials whose work is related to the weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to "illegal archaeology".
The dependent of one of the weapons stores, who asked his surname not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some alpheres, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the record and pass it over the valley.
“This carries the weapon to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he said.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when it is necessary to comply with the crime discovery plan, they make test purchases to illegal weapons traders,” he added.
“As in a luxury boutique.”
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the “Begovaya” platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a “squint” where we could negotiate.
The price of the weapon, I only learned there.”
Secretary of State Viktor Baranets
“To get a weapon I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store dependent. ”I have such a friend, but I don’t trust him much.”
In the markets there are sellers, but there also has to come, let’s say, “from Mr. Ivanov, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen to his daughter.”
I can even get a couple of steel manoples through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows that I will not delate him.
The beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tested himself in the role of illegal weapons buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was prepared to publish an article on this topic.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They delivered him a photo album where there was no "of everything".
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military reminds.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, is not offered cat by liebre: everything there can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don’t just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure that the weapon shots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of Sofas
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where we offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for any documents or personal meetings.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the advertising warning “Buy a gun or an ammunition.”
There users make their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
“Without permission, of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (conserved ortography).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created an enormous network of fictional websites and two-hand capture to those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the cave, and then, to extract coal in Siberia.
Military commentator and ex-militar Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cash system.
“In response, you are sent a photo and the instructions so that you know where the weapon is hidden,” NGO’s “Right to weapons” press secretary Dmitry Kislov said.
Viktor Baranets says that if a order is made online, one is left without weapon and puts him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created an enormous network of fictional websites and two-hand capture to those who want to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish to the cave, and then, to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The right to weapons", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranged chiefs.
According to the ministry’s official statistics, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive objects decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashmakers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages that are paid in the Walmart corporate supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald’s”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
For now, no one dares to ask whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose forces and amans itself in its first stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the objective of the protest organizers is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
40 cents a year.
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of rebounds was committed that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some Walmart workers, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protests alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed to people with modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything, from panels, hunting rifles and car batteries, to aspirators, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and product range have made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to the two critical words, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers.
These latter also complain of the bad working conditions, such as the lack of assembly loads or hand scans.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the salary increase and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to comment that the protest took place in nine states and that it did not cause any losses to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its stores from 8 a.m. on Thursday afternoon to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their casinos made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the leftist website Huffington Post, that “less than five” Walmart employees left their job and that the protest had not been more than “an other public relations trick,” organized by the workers’ syndicate.
“Free cabin!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not precisely the big Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is no one), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for illness and don't pay you for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to the federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I’m constantly stuck in some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if they don’t know what to give them to eat.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and fast food cookers begin to pay at least $15 per hour, i.e., that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded the creation of workers’ unions in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent this right and punish trade union activists with arguments and dismissals.
In other words, the administration rarely makes life easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disagreement
Noise protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the meeting at the McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital nor pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the city mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times has described, this has been the largest manifestation of this kind in American history of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which dozens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is still unclear if this will serve as a splash to provoke a massive movement.
“For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy.”
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among the fans of modern technologies, has recently been normally perceived primarily through the prisma of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it turned out that for the scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the subject of your research group?
We dedicate ourselves to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else is the future for us?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information introduction has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
You must release the world of computer science to our own, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First, to the devil with those foolish virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, you can't consider a panacea, it's up to solve the issue of privacy, since you don't always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of gestures, but not of separate movements, but of shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulser clock.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pot of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
Normally I just talk.
That will be very difficult to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have of modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also in Z.
It is also important the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern series-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects man-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the pictures per second are more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three "cams", one of which is actually the infrared radiation emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible diaphragm sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem.
Or vice versa, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the location curve of the cameras and see how this would help to determine the three-dimensional position.
Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it’s not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality “transmutable” when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass from the glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (the private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Your hands don’t feel anything.
What responses are your team preparing for this challenge?
In my conferences I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand in quality support for the image.
Register the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these “images in the air.” For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is found gives a similar feeling to which one feels if someone was blowing him in the yems of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the nervous endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
Have you tried to deceive your brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems he should feel at the moment he sees something?
That’s a good idea, we haven’t tried it yet.
Here we’re hiding another challenge with which we’ll have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very reduced space creates that goes to an open space, almost endless.We’re also working on the idea of the running bands (not like the gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balls.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes work with virtual reality attractive for researchers, that many things are found in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a barbecue man dressed in red from above down, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they appear.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilologists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiling and raises everyone the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organillo and became the organillero of St. Petersburg, since he has mature to make so difficult role, for his existence Bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey suscits aggressivity and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensible.
I made myself a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones that were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was already over.
I entered the theatre for clothes, music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
“For me it was important to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, as long as there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing adjusted pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and clients.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very little cult.
There is something recognizable in your work.
Many of my paintings are hits, in them the current and occurrence are clearly expressed.
I’m going to make a scheduled exhibition, “The Russian Museum in Pillars”.
Thieves are a timeless category.
I was sociable before, but now being so is painful and terrible.
But in the frogs everything is overwhelmed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by the clothes, oriented to the outside, but not to the inside of the person.
And,, that person should not even give his hand, but shoot him in the face.
And the deception will be eliminated when it changes clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organiller. - A cult city must have such a hero.
Who is better than me to be!
Well, but, can the commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouped in manades, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simplons other.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I’m not a $100 ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
They will see the abandoned ones, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10,000 will never come. as a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you’ve achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanged on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
They often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who denied money only to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good experts in culture.
There is one concept: a culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the correct everything was differently, the kings didn’t very well understand the culture, but they knew it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
Now there are very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to correctly evaluate these and open them the way.
Now the subjective personal taste is prospering.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. in Moscow there is a lot more culture, there is ground.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there is a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infamous.
We have to make the art fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a subsidy from St. Petersburg.
Giving light in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Cruises of spacecrafts with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve mankind the main question is made: How can the species continue in conditions of pregnancy or on the same planet of replacement?
I think there is little to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at large altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, plant experiments were carried out.
Four generations of orbital crops did not differentiate in anything from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects on the orbit, small fruit mosquitoes, the drosophiles.
In 1979, eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under pregnancy conditions.
This results in a normal poultry.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this poultry has to find support, keep on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
In the absence of support, the chickens gave volterets by chance.
And after 10 hours in the newborns was given a total atrophy of instincts.
The poultry did not react to light or sound.
And the unfortunate was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we succeeded that the chickens were born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev commented on the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the spacecraft had descendants.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have travelled to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing mankind has is the female body.
Our gauge flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“In the end, no one has answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, the veteran of the airspace sector.
In June 1964, just after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was on orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told to whom after long flights everything has done well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbit flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new paths in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero flotability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is their native element.
The small-anfibic men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water then.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath pass only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary the gravity, the strength of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepe very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for birth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear it with a special dress for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment we’re going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will give rise to bringing to Earth a disabled, a person completely unadapted,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, with time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Head of NKÚ: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not given the culpable politician
In terms of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application is cohesive.
So says Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "it is, in my opinion, what we lack," so describes the current situation.
The joint inspections of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors.
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to require obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the control committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country and, then, the practice itself.
We have united it all and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country’s legislation is “more strict and more comprehensive”, however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute?What do you think are the conclusions?
Exactly a common control of this kind could help us stop investing efforts in the concretization of the laws, reducing and improving the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
Saving economy means getting a good thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of the fact that reducing the limit of the tender means that we’re going to get it.
Per because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo", that those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do it easier than if the limits remain as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized in a different way?
In how many offices, such as the NKÚ, there works the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to our, with a college too, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
Competences are also to a certain extent analogue, however, as long as Germany has a federal organization, accounting courts are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities there, in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Accounts.
What about local law, is it simpler than our?
However, Germany remains a model in some aspects, but it cannot be accurately specified in what is better.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of the inspectors?
That’s sure not, but, I repeat, I don’t like doing this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model should face a large number of problems.
If not so, they’t have any benefit from collaborating with our office, don’t you think?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we do ex post checks, it is necessary to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, by which we have passed 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are rectified.
Do you think that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it implies an embryo for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that it will be so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "weighs" and it is impossible to comply with it.
With the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programs of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant the breach of the budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to strengthen the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision making.
A system of this kind will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
How do you get out of this?
We will see where this path begins.
The prime minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the shvarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office's action that has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict as to the way it should act formally.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded because it does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plaques, although most of them are transitable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads present ice and snow plates.
Although most of the roads are transitable, some should be extremely cautious.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but presented ice and snow plaques.
The temperature decreases and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. during the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snow in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
Instead, in the crests of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still bad due to the cloud, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 Highway and the first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, precautions are recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and scratched.
All roads of second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still tracks with remains of ice and snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some Eastern Bohemia roads there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains may have formed a layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Highway Directorate reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of forming ice plaques, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be produced in the neighborhoods of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and above all on the second and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of Eastern Bohemia, the sky will be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
The temperatures will usually oscillate between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the region of Pilsen are transitable today in the morning, although precautions should be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be ice, the temperatures will oscillate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves cloudy, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is derived from the information from the region’s road operations control center.
The D5 highway is transitable almost without restrictions, although precautions are recommended, especially on the road between the 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany may be tracks with ice plates.
The roads of second and third category are wet, so in this case, it is also warned of tracks with ice plates.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially on the less transit roads in the Šumava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers who head to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find themselves with partially drowned snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road to Videlský kříž.
Road operators took the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the roads administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
“In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find themselves with half-deal snow in direction of Jeseník,” a operator of the Šumper road administration to the ČTK confirmed today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues went to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the pistes of the highest areas are now cleaned and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transitable without restrictions, in the Šternberská the drivers should drive with caution in the forest streams, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have complications in different stations at first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain in the hill. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There were no complications of service.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day, rain and snow are expected to flourish and at night the sky will be clean and there will be ice.
From the general roads have been announced unfavourable conditions on the road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been harvested over the road with the weight of snow.
Shimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarming news that we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group likes to do jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Moreover, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-of-the-art act that we have planned for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Maya calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The previous day, December 20 at 21 hours, we will host 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same hour in which the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
To whom came this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other interprets, also sang the so-called himne against the end of the world, which takes the title "End of the world, cancelled".
Currently it’s very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn’t end...
The song will be played by all performers at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many beneficial events and concerts.
We are committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
To what will the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world be destroyed?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Study, which we take to end in its sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students of the Jedličkův ústav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they do fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay to teachers and we make an effort to do so possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
There are several groups and interprets at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other “spectacular” action in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards disabled people and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there remains unusual that a person moves alone through the city center on an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone on a wheelchair on an elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematise the problems of people with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take the example of advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we are going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their behalf in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want.
But it’s not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers arise, it will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I touch, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a working partner.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we went a little out of the hands (laughs).
However, popularity has not arrived until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite the fact of connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the aid from the European Union, we can also allow us quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then it is not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe him?
If we want to do a quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require a certain discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they realize they have to go two days to essay, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euforia quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
One is Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people go and go, we cannot avoid it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda of Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through a videoconference to sing together the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World, Canceled"
The goal of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO-free educational center in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, whose cost rises to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entrance to the anticipated sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the Ministers Meeting of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in the year 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the Agency’s project committee.
However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts were already dedicated to space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld’s conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study “Introduction to cosmonatics.”
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld was awarded in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for their "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
In 1925 a dresin was built in Poland, which was to be supplied with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the displays of the project are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dresin is limited to the information collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile techniques for military use projects and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronomical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy is referred for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, it was proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronomical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronomical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronomy.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Meteorologiczna) missile, which was a success and became the first Polish missile in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and did not reach the 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket air tests began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The RM-34 rocket would have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differentiated each other by the available space for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
The new version is Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social labour law.
The resolution triggered a warming discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, like in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with untouched financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (the wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "prove a drop" of the competitor's price with the aim of doing with the majority of the market and, thus, increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale, it means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, buy there cheaper or either disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation provokes the total disinterest of entrepreneurs for paying taxes and compensating the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is universally so known that it is not necessary to submit concrete statistical data.
The scrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the disposal of their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is evident in the changes in current laws.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the employee’s restricted right as regards labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the increased differences between poor and rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot maintain themselves with their own work.
The number of people who receive this kind of aid reaches the million.
In the framework of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
People, pressed by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to disappear with a bad salary at the border of society, with the hope that one day it will reach the country capital private investor.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
If it comes to other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for an infime part of a European salary.
This also affects Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not interfere in the economy by breaking into control.
Then it is necessary to wonder if private capital does not influence with its egoism on the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprobable everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the lack of financial means, commission the drafting of law projects to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.
This type of bills are later approved in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emerge from the people, as it is proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one that Appiános describes in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time disintegrating and the administrations occupied force."
In exchange for subsidies, unlawfully obtained benefits and help to finance stones or swords.
The surrender and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the urns with the voted vote in advance..." "There was no people with character that aspired to a position in the administration, so once, due to this disorganization, the state was eight months without councils..." "He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." Although Appianus thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on discontinued preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
The private capital is unable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unfinished liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite break, waiting for the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The solution passes through concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society in the benefit of the state.

After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have arisen, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and insists the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and puts Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who's guilty of the periodically repeated murders and who's the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and didn't live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the telon, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small Middle East land surface.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of the struggle for power is in the first row.
In every time we can find a great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always the ones who directed their steps in an autonomous way or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been able to reach in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't exclude it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written close to them.

In the 90s of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their back, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant shares in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five, after defeating Gaddafi there were only four, but so far Russia has supedited the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Bank of America, began during the Secession War to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to demand the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their passion for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (as much of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than an avant-project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis trigger and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation.If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the 1907 was not repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian throne heir, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the First World War was triggered, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wares to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demolition of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the banks and politicians to create, in a hidden way, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the weak masses.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspirated to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (regression to Sion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above put the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it’s hard to know if Hitler threw too much out of the rope to which international bankers had linked him at the beginning or if everything he did formed part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which war repairs imposed on Germany opened the way to the Second World War, with the proclamation of the State of Israel the focus was created for a Third War.
If international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in the Second World War, would become a first-line victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? where injustice generates injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the covetry of some individuals and their passion for the world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandataries, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, through which it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now shown the words that David Rockefeller spoke in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accomoded financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
“And it obliges all, small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, to not be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, must sum the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: If you get raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstrations occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the destroyed shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah by the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it would put the confidence of its allies in other countries in danger.
But the release of the prisoners in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not at its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to release the prisoners by force.
The prisoners were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck theme an episode of this story, which harvested a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this helped a hidden story an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the recording of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of gender
The plan drawn by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
So that the lie seemed true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society had even a real office.
The details about the operation were kept in secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that came out well, a deception (a example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the credit sequence are displayed emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA and other institutions: dressed men who analyze the situation at the negotiation table, in the halls of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to reboot his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of joke, has become a respectful director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long-movie, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town: City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran “routes” in Canada.
The introductory sequence of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of disconcert and lack of forecast that arises when, somewhere, the story gives a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn’t come out all so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at the Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unfinished search for its track become a madness).
The weakness of Argo is the incontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic trace, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, it will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for the inflation of balls, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on “the regulations or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop.”
“It happened to us after the last event, the EU is scheduled to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in major European companies,” explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women had better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline shrink the size of the cages of chickens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
It has been criticized the factic prohibition of using the expression "untar mankind" or the withdrawal of the classic lamp from the stores.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes this kind of decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose claims in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the claims of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize non-homogeneized national standards so far, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription last year according to which in the inflatable balls that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to inflat them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to to toys, balls are the main cause of child death by asphyxia.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of mattoes by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events occur even in our country.
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia.To not hurt Greece’s sensitivity, one must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the EU prescription on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum amounts of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for storage in conserve, which led to a threat of substantial fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the request for subsidies.
This kind of ideas arose not in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are in disadvantage because we don’t have sea.
We ask the European Union for a compensation,” said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in 2004.
He argued it with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and it had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
At the end, the European Commission showed its willingness to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of cereal from countries that have no access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to the municipalities by the local development ministry led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often white of criticism, the EU’s regulatory efforts and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also touched by the sensitive fiber, like other EU countries, the struggle for the right to the denomination of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always come out victorious from these puzzles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and the Austrians, successfully defended the denomination of origin of Olomouc, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and passed to be called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar remolacha.
In the official list of EU protected denominations, along with the world-known feta and gorgonzola cheese, the mazapán of the German city Lübeck or the jamon of Parma, are already found for example the Karlovy Vary cookies, the carpa of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of lúpul of Žatec.
As EU protected seas, they may be proud of the Pardubice ginger bread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší ships.
People want the Republic to be saved, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
How did you get to the presidential election?
It is not about being a senator or a president.
If everything was good in our country, then I’t present my candidacy.
But I can no longer endure seeing how the last twenty years in our country are stolen, how the thieves remain impun, the taxes are increasing and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I’m 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly after it has been put on the way to the presidency.
Are you not giving back to those people who have voted for it?
I’ve always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I precised that if I was elected senator, I would submit my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas reality.
That’s why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we push anyone who wants to initiate a change.
This is added to the media, which disprestige you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom of lies.
From me it is said that I have suborned journalists or that I have been Jiří Paroubek’s adviser.
Let’s talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
That is why the law must be changed.
As a president, it does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have formed part of a pressure group so that the guide office was recognized as an autonomous work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right or left, it is rejected intentionally and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without assassinations or party dogms, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of leftists.
For me it doesn’t matter, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters is that we go forward.
I don’t care if someone is right or left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It’s a joke when you say you’re a populist.
But do you not demonstrate it with what you say?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
You try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
Without the support of the Parliament, there are only signs left.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to it.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimate criminal and financial responsibility for the politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And, eventually, they’ll have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character that points out disputes, you can make pressure on the political scene.
Let’s take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I assert that I am just an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I just started in politics and try to get the greatest support possible for my program.
I try to get things forward myself, but if it doesn’t go well, within six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I don’t do anything, that’s why I’ve visited a series of well-known personalities, for if they might be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For me, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought the light of fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself starting from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am in the balance.
60 percent of the population did not go to the urns and, those who did it, voted the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as, for example, the direct election of mayor or governors.
Are you planning to form your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I don’t have time for it, to check the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor have I money.
I don’t have money even for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Do you have no money?
Speaking of property statements, what is yours?
I estimate my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a ground worth 25 million, a floor worth 10 million, another floor worth eight million, a collection of art works worth ten million, a Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was galant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, its property is worth 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don’t want to put too much money on your side.
It is not very convincing.
I don’t have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to debt?
I have already paid 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there’s not too much interest in my program.
And I don’t have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign expenses cover in essence what I will receive in terms of senator salary.
For example, I could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I’t present myself as a candidate.
So will you continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Did you not say before that I was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I partially left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
The people would want the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much do you earn a month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I am still winning.
If I was a president, I would leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study demonstrates that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain"- 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic appearance, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a transit passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “In addition, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters for pleasure in those past fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city located at the doors of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fugaz visit, holds the doubtful honor of having lifted up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this so shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented in the euro bills in the form of miniatures of armed concrete decorated.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so was the way the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: it had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, all a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the topic with his usual serenity and compared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked confused around him and shrinked on his shoulders, Maas went to shrink the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for Spijkenisse’s book mountain, the so-called ‘Boekenberg’.
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a postal office and a couple of housing and housing buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little city lacking in history, which so far had nothing more than to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly municipality behind whose white façade one would intuit rather a milk center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It’s true that there’s an elevator that carries us right in the center of this mountainous mass, but true space and reading lovers don’t use it, but they prefer to fuse with their topography at every step of their climbing to the top.
The completely crystaled interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the ground of brick and the elegant lamps unquestionably support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view, you can get to visualize the banks of the park, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the book shelves are placed along the façade and in the center an enormous dark room opens which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classic space configuration and get the reading area from the interior to the outside.
The mountain interior is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black roofs that assume the functions of wall coating, parapet and barrel at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project chief in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that’s how one day, in a fresh farm, we meet with the adequate subproduct from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a small-millimeter thick plastic tissue has been used as a base to subject the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This thin tissue lasts two seasons and then dissolves.
For the library this tissue was pressed, for the first time in such amounts, until it achieved four-cm thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a mixture of new car and sports shoes.
After 105 hills it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain we are waiting for the reward: from the cafeteria not only you have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some delicious Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in enormous strawberries.
These create a pleasant atmosphere along withining the adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“While it’s hard to believe given its large crystal surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is located under an enormous crystal pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours in its interior.
The enormous wooden shores located in transversal direction to the crystal façade serve to give shadow and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is about automatic persian.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technologies sector, has already dared to put the foot in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She quotes "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "Late Soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book of their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical holes of a library that has not yet its full file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept is silent.
The roofs are filled.
“There is nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
It is only there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a whole success in that royal discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literature history.
No matter how young and unknown it is.
Finally, a starting point to configure your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has abstained the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a fairly terrible diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany said it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of the United Nations Observer State.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
and why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the U.S. position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight prohibition zone.
This was finally declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are in play?
Yes, it is so.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, getting away from a policy led by the United States, so to say, and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are on a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they’re still trying what their role will be, but they’ve already started the way towards a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, shows itself willing to defend postures different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position adopted regarding the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, he must be careful and not alienate from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I’t give it so much importance because it’s not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining to vote on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German posture enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I don’t think there has been such a dramatic breakthrough as in the case of Libya.
Maybe with this Germany has managed to have a certain respect.
After all, all this has done nothing but to demonstrate that it is a country they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there disagreement between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed due to the U.S. internal policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, due to the political situation that is living here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend in public that posture.
I think the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the enormousness it is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to conciliate its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That’s exactly what they’re doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship itins with Israel.
This has always been a big topic.
But I think the Germans have clear that they should play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor?Does Germany really want to assume a protagonist role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it always results in something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it still costs the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany posits itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are dissolved.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seeing this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence on European policy is decreasing, but the EU does not cover that emptiness at the moment, who remains then?
The Germans will not have any more remedy than to take on a more protagonist role.
Even if they don’t like it, if it’s unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular village, it’s life!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese Brands
Armani is a world-known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not submit a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they are going to be given the right.
“For foreigners it becomes increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the buffet Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada it is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports items Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which it keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested the registration of the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also served by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is too well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsifications.
By order of his customers, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially gives Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term “Bang Dakuan”.
This is the case for women who have “fishing” a wealthy man.
Chinese officials do not feel guilty
“It’s harmful to the business, we have to fight against it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is enormous.”
The financial losses and process costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury items and the one that grows at the highest pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of inscriptions of doubtful legality in the registration of brands is complicated and also implies a lot of money.
The processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court rejected a claim because it had passed so long that the name subject to the claim had already become a “market reality.”
"If the prosecutor has bad luck, he may even have to pay the plagiarism because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company which has been recently absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, used in the beginning a white and blue logo that greatly reminded BMW; the case was brought to court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodrile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staff donation.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, a 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending for resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth year in a row, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that rises to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been packed in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacturing of imitation car parts,
The imitators have managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the names are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and Delegated Counsel of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also denied the appeal of the ammunition.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg reason, but the opposite side is still fighting in the present day.
You need to be very careful
Now the case has reached the gates of the Higher Court of Justice, where it remains pending for resolution.
Wentzler confides in being able to solve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has had to review up to a hundred years old expedients to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite a "suma of six figures in euros" with the aim of getting to a friendly deal, but did not succeed.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe.
In particular, if the imitators assure themselves there the rights on unprotected trademarks.
So, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the Freudenberg name for shoes and skin products.
The group has long abandoned this commercial scope, yet it has managed to prevent the registration.
“We need to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what you have to do is "register also in China everything that may be susceptible of protection," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would throw us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi chorus is tested, and in Switzerland, the AIDS orphans are glad.
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it begins with the dance: cowboy shoes, basketball shoes, shark shoes and moussains look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three and four.
Only then the voices of the singers (contralto, low, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, rushing up, turning up and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his casillas by trying to put order with his energic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi chorus tries a new song.
The fifty singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human genetist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy piece, each voice of the chorus has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: the zulú, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botsuana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Switzerland.
Help for self-help
According to an ONUSIDA estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme, around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Switzerland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany padrins for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a child can be tailored.
This contribution will cover the school’s registration, the uniform and guarantee a hot meal per day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu “historic narrator” or “panegirist”.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this bantou language, but they know how to sing.
For ten years this chorus has been testing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to its place of origin: South Africa.
A 8.733 kilometers straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Switzerland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German chorus.
40% are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple shells of shell and shell, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no parents because they have suffered from AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Switzerland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy around the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see the circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion to half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Switzerland are carrier of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something over thirty years has become something usual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this recondite population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothes and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few what made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
However, a year later the chorus founded the "Voices for Africa" association which since then has professionally occupied the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the ETS of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral ETS are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The slices and the sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute part of the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea infections.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections hasined a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is a third less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urine discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or worms.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore they are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and by physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend submitting regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most ETSs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the honoraries that the crown covers for its performances throughout Germany, they come to collect a lot of money.
“In total, we’ve already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says proud Annette Lennartz, the association’s president.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is secure of herself and with leadership gifts manages the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogs", as the older women are called in Zulú, are the pilars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care that children go to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who don’t have anyone remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cookers who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, perceives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a coat school, has built two galleries and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the inhabitants of the village have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite how patented this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually spoken openly about it.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
It’s a strange thing in a country where the king has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporists who travel the country from one side to the other and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free preservatives, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin contact with skin.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorus travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholia, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to raise a couple of tears to some like another rabies border soldier.
The journey always leads them to Esitjeni, where singers visit the apadrinated children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is well known.
“Come to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people of the place say.
And after walking the 8,733 kilometers straight line back to Heidelberg to the Bergheimer Street test rooms filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see his light shine from there.
NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer is likely to have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, there is also ice water, as it is stated from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice.
It seems that this has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one connects the find of ice with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says Messenger chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
In a completely unnoticed way for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, sondes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small windows to the immense space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun right behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars appear as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "near-born" stars.
This star formation region, called unromantically by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This scattered image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.

The Hélice Nebula appears as an enormous red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has validated the surname of North America.
The combination of a normal photo and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.

Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true artworks.
The image published by the Austral European Observatory shows the Triple Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trífida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the candy heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuk the astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in process of merger are balanced one to the other to end shocking irreplaceably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don’t like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the surname Molinillo Austral.
The photo from the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographies made by different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring located 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of the brightest young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, also continuously new stars arise; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found primarily hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and the images they offer are increasingly deep.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the US, the Large Binocular Telescope is lifted.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Great Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed height angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equivalent to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radiotelescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of alien life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, bringing processing capacity.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It is not expected to be able to take pictures by 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions with a diameter of a mirror of thirty meters.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 NASA announced that 1,235 planets candidates had been localized since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched to space on a Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers come from the base that in the southern pool of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there are no feasible evidence, as the Messenger probe rotates around the planet on a much closer orbit to the northern pool.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, now scientists are sure that it is so.

A footprint search in a country where 97-year-old people are still considered young.
The tour through the mountainous region of Talysh could be qualified as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great stress through the sincere road that passes alongside forest hills, rivers of great cabal and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a village of which we don't know much, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city presumes a too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that doesn’t seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban nuclei, eight hours are needed because the road is of one direction.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this refined region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you have to have to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the world’s oldest people’s festival,” Fatulayeva said.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded the 100 years of age.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136 years.
However, the museum's indisputable star is Shepherd Shepherd Şirali Muslimov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslimov’s age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. It seems he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Shirali Muslimov then mistaken in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live people of very advanced age,” Scholz says, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region located around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many older people live here?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum’s director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink daily a glass of dried butter, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At his 97 years of age, he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves incansably an enormous butter tin.
Eight people live under a roof, among them one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
There are also two kids from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with shaped shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the towel it hides two long shades of dark pink hair that his son discovers proud of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen to me and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live.
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and snacks.
I have never been shopping in a supermarket.
Then he tells us of his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to its shape when the “wanted father”, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that is prophesied to the paternal figure of the nation, which leads its country as a dictator, does not know boundaries.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness surrendered to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people in Azerbaijan don’t know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva pays 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, a amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And the canose son of Mirzayeva is right: “In our culture the elderly are very respected.”
They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this was not enough reason to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution the expression “human rights” is missing.

Manifestations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not go into pathetism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to the Copts Christian, the Liberal, the Illustrated Muslims and the Secular.
All of them, drowned without a remedy so far into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the shores of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the competences of the Constitutional Court and expand its "to save the revolution."
Nevertheless, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to be deprived of your jurisdiction?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the deletion also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean of “principles”?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margins of legal maneuver that it carries up, to impose a more strict interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the country’s most important Islamic institution with a great power in all Sunni Islamism.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judgment.
A large part of the Constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a hard opposition repression.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promove its morality and values.”
This is a formulation so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it is nothing more than censorship.
No article expressly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or calumniating the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the formulation that prohibits “offensive to people”
Is a cartoon of the president enough or a joke about a letter?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the deletion that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
For weeks, the opposition is closing rows against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir Square in the Caribbean and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we’ll finish winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Nobel and former director of the International Atomic Energy Organization, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the drawer of the constitution should be "in the rubbish of history."
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “state strike against democracy.”
“When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and defeat it,” opponent Jasser Said said.
“We’re not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
On its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to celebrate a counter-manifestation; if not at the Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the salafists took part in it by screaming: “The people require the application of the divine law.”
They demanded Mursi to “clean the country”, while they proclaimed, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi’s supporters didn’t want to risk that something like that would happen.
The Muslim Brothers affirmed that both those who oppose the deletion of the constitution and its supporters would have expressed their high and clear opinions.
Now it would have come the time to let the people decide in the urns which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the removal of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
“The expression ‘Human Rights’ does not even appear”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was hit, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ does not even appear in the new constitution,” he regrets in a conversation with the newspaper ‘Welt am Sonntag’.
The extension of Mursi’s powers to the three powers of the state made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,” Saeda regrets.
But democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the shores of the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestant at Tahrir Square warns: “You’re conceiving a monster that you won’t be able to control.”
The Norwegian Rakfisk: The World's Most Malignant Fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success keeps some relationship with its avidity for a very bad fish?
Take a lot of excessively healed cheese.
Located in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then smell the paralyzing aroma of Rakfisk, one of the Norwegian exquisites.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is a salad trick that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on how badly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it turns dark and goes cold, the Norwegians go in trope to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to say, captivating.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, the city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that has travelled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before the refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in full winter, when it’s already well fermented, it’s taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it’s eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not so much rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite unhealthy, of the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. a cup of beer or a sandwich will cost you the freezer of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway doesn’t usually appear in the international news day order and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who accributed to shootings and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
Norwegians hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After a lot of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the beginning of the 1970s, of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re going so well,” says Anna, our cameroon, as she goes through rakfisk bands and that, with her long blonde melena and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, prudent people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like struggle, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry, is invested in a special fund in the benefit of future generations.
While everyone wasted money that he didn’t have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the billboard closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And eat rakfisk,” he adds with a carcassed breakthrough.
I’m in the snow making tail to eat something; I’ve already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite sweet to taste.
But at night, that bad fish returns.
The hotel in which I go is one of the many locals in which a rakfisk dinner is celebrated in which the comensals vote for the best fish, or the one that most puts the nasal fosses to the test.
A television has connected live with a presentator that carries bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish there up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
“Here is our score, Havard.”
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe they are the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While Mexico's entering president, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take possession of his office, BBC's correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is bad nowadays.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already by itself congestioned, a steel hole has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing a huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from getting to their workplace, but to prevent protesters from getting to parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has gone obtaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already charged about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Desk.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to that goal.”
Before coping with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as a governor of his native state, the state of Mexico.
A very populated and fast-growing state, which surrounds the capital; the opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucal city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive by one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is an enormous improvement compared to the struggling and filled with backs that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern polideportive and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We believe that he can make a real and lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Deputy of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“In particular, with regard to security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was banished by Vicente Fox in the year 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the qualification that the opposition makes of the lack of essence of the new president.
“He is a very honest man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic man of state and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to hear.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that a lot of people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Black City, the contrast with the drowned streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway trams is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help in the fight against the drug bands that operate in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a wastewater, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than in Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for their violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto’s critics say, in the best of the cases, he didn’t know how to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office.
The most critical accuses their administration of making the eye thick.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to do efforts to contain tears while showing me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if they had cleaned her body,” Mrs. Buendía reminds.
“There were signs that it had been hit and the rigor mortis had already appeared.”
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
But that’s exactly what the family says they’ve been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if it were a old shismosa, a scamming, a complaint.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that they go away.”
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Dozens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope it’s the same type of president that it was when I was a governor,” says the PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of City of Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not denounce bad treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed based on Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtering of confidential information in U.S. history, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the misconduct he now claims that he suffered while he was under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecutor's office carried out to Manning in a view before the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of the unit officials that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which was carried out during a look at the defense's request to desestimate the case given that his imprisonment had been hard and that it had already supposed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was arrested.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while he was in service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In Friday’s view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials filled after the visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico’s military prison, where he was imprisoned in the regime of maximum recruitment from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers had asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given by the celators as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaint of misconduct, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concern about some issues and that the officials who visited him had talked about those issues and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not leave constance of those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'without incidences' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I't have mentioned any problem," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a council responsible for examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to guarantee his protection and the security of other people.
“I wanted the senior state to know that I was well and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Navy Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that in one occasion he lost knowledge due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very anguish.
“My world was reduced only to the Arafjon Camp, to that cage,” Manning explained on Thursday.
“I thought I would die in that cage.”
Manning said, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a handful, some chanclets, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even burial during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the gentlemen could not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that he could turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint on the treatment Manning received in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to stay standing unknown in front of the celators and other prisoners.
Manning had witnessed that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the mantle during the count.
During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said he deducted by the order given to him by the celler that he had to let the mantle fall with which he could have covered, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger for himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his indoor clothes or chancles to self-leaning but that he had not done it.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their clothes, their chancles and their glasses.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will take at least into account the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted in the war council, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defence said it is planned to make Manning blame for minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to reopen this weekend and the prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has claimed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to any detained who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, the filtering of national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If he is declared guilty of all the charges, he could face forever chain.
The American-Mexican Identity Crisis
He said many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says the Mexican-American people are trapped between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down by the explanated and arrived in the immigration processing zone and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two colas: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Strangers".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was going.
As I grew up in Central California, throughout my life I’ve been called “Mexican.”
It’s ethnic tachigraphy, the same way my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends qualify themselves as “Italians.”
Later I decided for “American-Mexican”.
This was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, the tachigraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. enough well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have a native vocabulary level and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the tail of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week in which Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always that the leaders of these two countries meet, it consists: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was looking forward to speaking also about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time it is so likely that a Mexican stay in Mexico as he adventures to go to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block in the style of the European Union in North America.
Moreover, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancor.
Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, at the time a U.S. official says anything that brings the least criticism to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma put themselves on foot of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really implies a whole challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about rancor?
There is a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not so.
The only reason there are so many Mexican people living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogy tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities was closed in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the times that person fit in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are faithful to them.
In Mexico no.
And, despite that we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his way of view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they’t have gone.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, yet, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when I was a girl, reminds me that there is this blow between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know more solidly who they are and the second this annoys them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of any of the two.
We love listening to the Mexican group The Northern Tigers, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
They see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes of course...
That won’t happen.
There is too much rhinorism.
And, with wage inequality, corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you'll be alone with this idea, friends.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still angry for how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
by Hmmm.
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old Battle, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely base for peace
Could there be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is empty.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it all made pieces they like or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional hole.
Maybe this makes your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that your deadly point situation could disappear.
A war that is neither lost nor won.
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on November 21, this week’s confrontations have strengthened the halcons of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say they have forced the Israelis to retire, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewing regional power that previously had been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas.
The exciting members of Hamas say that the Islamist middle moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah-milician party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could defeat Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most populated and fundamental difference of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laic despota who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had not too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas’ cousins and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas arises as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
In terms of the military issue, they have put Hamas in its place.
The Israeli Iron Cup anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quiet...for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence.
Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the missiles shot from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrows the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why mimic these retorced Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rocket as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Per the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and other places don’t have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be addressing internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the region’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the high fire is a good desire and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dust that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demography worsenes the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic fee.
Both bands need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the question of wise people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small to short-term, is that the high fire will give a little more of impulse to the alien people who are struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas that it accepts the idea of a 1967 border-based Jewish state, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category in the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
During his first term, he refused to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reticent to pay his attention to him.
This attitude implies a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.

General tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Advertisements on the risks of smoking and body parts with illnesses look on boxes of an apagate green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an embrace of an off-green olive, scary images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick for being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a type of small source.
It is the most strict regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
Studies show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do it.
"You can see that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that show, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smokers rates in the world and these changes will not affect much the benefits of multinational companies, other countries are considering to take similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exercised a huge pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would foster the black market of tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences,” said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco they will bring from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the law has been approved.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand for silicone pearls and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the wallets had shot almost from zero two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more existences.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit television advertising and sports sponsorship and that force most sellers not to put cigarettes in the sight, tobacco marketing has gone to be done online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews on brands from “cividadans on foot” published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It’s to be wondered if it’s just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the annoyance of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulations implies than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, although none of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to draft a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the wallets.
Currently, they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, stricter laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I simply don’t pay attention to them.”
"You pick the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
“In sincere, there’s only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack stain at the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more complicated to place them on the stains.
“Normally it took an hour to dissolve a delivery; now I’m late four,” Yu says.
“The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it’s already, well, it’s finished and we’ve closed the store,” he says while lifting his hands up.
In a world constantly connected, it’s not so bad to get bored a little.
During the Thanksgiving Day holidays this year, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boring.
I will not lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting us of duty-free stores.
But there are increasingly more academics and children’s development experts who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it’s good that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Fatigue forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, currently, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boring brings.
So, should we accept the boredom with good mood?
Yes is.
and no.
But we will talk about it later.
First, like a lot of people, it supposed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boring would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as says Peter Toohey, a Greek and Roman History professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
“In fact, the history of boring is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boring that dates from the 1st century BC.
We also need to think about how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very various ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and proposing the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boring as the experience of “wishing, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
It affirms that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
It indicates that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boring, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Fatigue may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem they have.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble focusing.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants heard a tape from a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the contigua room a full-volume television program that did not keep any relationship, others listened to it with low-volume, so it was barely perceived, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the low-volume program showed more boring than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and they attributed it to boring.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, disturbance of attention can lead to boring,” said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
"In fact, we now know that moving or making scratches, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
“The research shows that those children to whom they are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those to whom they are forced to be quiet,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a bored film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “tendance scale to boring.”
The scale includes questions like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do it all."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically they need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, generally, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was in contact with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while they were in school or doing the duties, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
3 percent of parents say they’re bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the current fatigue percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he knew was that "adolescence is a period in which boring reaches its highest quotas", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my first question: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it’s not so, because, taken to the end, it can make us exposed to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to fight it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Naturity is the way your brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s the most appropriate.
If you’re bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it's possible that he's not bored anymore, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or to do it," says Professor Fenske.
And "this capacity of dosing applies to other situations," she points out.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to better control himself in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to praise the boredom.
But we should not be too critical to him.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable apart from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood is agreeing.
“In our way of view, we need to get bored more, but boredness is a desire too anguish and annoying to relate it to something that deserves it,” he says.
It indicates that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment in which we are constantly overestimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise ceases.”
Colorado: No book of instructions for the new marijuana consumption law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal proceedings for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the floors near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court appeal for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes that carry each a $100 fine) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
“They treat us as criminals,” says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the voting that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the holding of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of smaller causes by drug holding depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession crimes are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was approved.
Police departments have ceased to submit charges against the older than 21 years of small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors of the most conservative districts of Colorado have committed to moving forward with the cases open by possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's going to be the next," said Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in the state of Washington are also giving turn to the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses; all this before the deadline arrives, on 1 December 2013.
They say, for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of marijuana use regulation, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
“There is no real precedent that serves us as a model,” he says.
The Washington law, named I-502, enters into force on December 6, which leaves also a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the license system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
Moreover, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer an “suitable access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business at a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nobody will find it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On November 21, Oates, the head of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers in which he informed them that the city prosecutor would cease to interpose judicial actions for mild faults by possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would cease to submit charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said they would be responsible for complying with the city’s regulations that regulate marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue narcotic traffickers and drug vendors.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to press consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has the obligation to proceed against those faults that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the countryside of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
“I don’t consider it being losing time by continuing to comply with the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana for recreational use to the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecologist experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Law.
“There’s been so long taking people before the courts that, in fact, they can’t yet accept that it’s legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it was alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new boundary of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still predicts the consideration of marijuana sale and cultivation as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana legalization have the hope that the Department of Justice will surrender.
Despite some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes have occurred, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales business for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
“While it’s likely that drug agents don’t throw down doors to confiscate a small drug stock, they’ll probably be disagreeed to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, an ex-drog policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the election, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipality.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against voting in favour of what the state voted."
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was thrown out of Oxford because I was a Tory"
Do not attack university students for their views just now
I don’t remember any moment in my life in which I hadn’t been dreaming of getting a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, at two weeks of occupying my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 80s to curs the history career, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and began to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper said I had abandoned because I didn’t tolerate some college colleagues to have sex in the side room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because they forced me to drink in discharged cups.
The truth was less fun.
I flew from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason, that in the corner of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent Margaret Thatcher adviser and I supported the conservative party.
You may be wondering what this comes from now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights that homosexuals, disabled and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate student group) of the Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously apart, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunity Committee of their college to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary entitled "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and on the Right) on the students' policy and that presented the Tories as excentric and neonazi.
He showed postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lightening a plated suit and a baston with the silver stamp.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by the introduction of higher enrollment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old and OUCA elected president, says the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the people who are center-right has worsened.
“This constitutes a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, it was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "honoris causa" after the cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
For the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the teachers, I received a sample of the bitterness I was waiting for.
I discovered that the teachers did not only make the fat look at the mofa that was made by the conservative university students, but they participated in it with good intention.
The policy of miners strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate to English French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came below.
“Mr. Wyatt,” said the professor Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
I did not give one.
Pitt, a low man with a face that looked like a mass of biscuit, knew well how to throw out a bad bile.
“Is thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
I burned my eyes from the tears I tried to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt said.
I returned to my room as a soul in penance.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he told me kindly.
“I am afraid that this is how it goes.
They meet anyone who is suspicious of being Tory.
For me it’s very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it’s even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories seem to be laborists.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disimulate.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty perverted.
“How do Tories have sex?” he asked one.
“They’re giving a puzzle to each other, right?”
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me only after night?
Should I be working and suppress my natural trends?
The three years that were waiting for me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History intended for my college.
He was hated because he was not only of the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just around there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because it adhered to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a cathedral at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He did not believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said with sadness.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
“Give him another opportunity.
I’m sure they’ve done it just to jok.
My heart would go away if you left it.”
Exhausted by so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of me, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succeeded in the pressure and had renounced his credo.
The next week, during a seminar in which another history professor had insinuated, all seriously speaking, that I was a “people’s enemy”, I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “washed my brain” and called them “old stupid.”
The treasure lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last key on the roof of my university career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed with a key.
I was in the shadow of fear and, five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When they went, I made the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You may call me weak crying.
But no person aged 18 should be subjected to such level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, is hidden behind a reputation not deserved of equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety”
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Costure" show, which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of welcoming an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Costure", a retrospective apoteous that brings together more than 130 high costure clothes created by its "maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the collofon of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentine has always felt fascinated by the narrated and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next 3 March, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most granate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophy of his social ascension: from the humble modest of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with the kingdom has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t shut off the collars of their pits on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains Heini’s ex-wife Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to popularity.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, Lighting a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the modist’s charisma.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything his spirit was seen and felt.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” the “top model” recalls, which began working with him during the Paris High Costume Week, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Discovery of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-corresponded loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous gateway of seventy meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a "audience" of dream that looks Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and skin shirt that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In that public of manicures rise names such as Siberia of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modist, 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette shirt and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“It was a gift he made to me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s mouses.
“I prefer him above others for his feminity, for his great love for women, because it highlights our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria says.
I like the colors you use, they have great light and are “donators” to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she wore a Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to the age and the opportunity to wear one of her night clothes.
The time finally arrived in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine dress to wear on a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red costume, with fold of folds, "corsage" drapped and scratched word of honor.
“It was a dream made reality,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her party clothes of the modist with "the highest care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries."
The “King” of Fashion
The great end of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
They needed four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls their coatings) to make that silk-colored dress with pearls incrustations, twelve different types of coating and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a fite of the high costume of the late 20th century, “the return of the clients of the high society.”
Obnubilated for years with the elite's "savoir-être", now Valentino is his best exemplar.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, condecorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“It has always attracted my attention to its refinement, its calmness, its pulse and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of me.
“He was impeccable, time didn’t pass for him.”
If a princess says that...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health loading 70 pounds of sulfur through stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who get their lives by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfuric gas that emits from the entrances of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After launching large sulphur rocks, which in total get to weigh about 70 pounds, it carries them into two bamboo baskets that loads over their shoulders through scarp stone trails.
They are just 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to rise by the turtle, keeping the balance and tiredly measuring their steps so that they don’t scratch and fall by the precipient.
They know that any transpire could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who was scattered years ago by the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once up, passes are opened among the tourists who photographed them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatiguously charging the heavy canasts, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1.850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupias (5 cents of euro) for every kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupias (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make cerillas, artificial fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“As the normal thing is to load 70 pounds, we take about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” Anto explains, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends melted, but it allows you to gather 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such unhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win on the field.
“The journal of the miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is of two million rupees (167 euros),” the portor, who previously worked as an albanil on the tourist island of Bali, clarifies.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupias (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as contundent as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing hard, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At his 27 years old, Anto takes three playing the peeling at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass him in fact despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathing hard, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano throw down.
This is the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, cameraman or receptionist of a hotel, but instead does the work of a mula.
Sharing an immune wooden cabin with other porters, it rises every day at 2 a.m. because the sulfur does not cease to eat at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting with a small linterna adhered to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the salt cakes on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its pinguistic benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supplies any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and both the weight.
In fact, they don’t even see part of the 30,000 rupias (2,5 euros) charged by camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupias (1,2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for the people,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old portor who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left the school.
Capable to raise up to 110 pounds, she says she will stand working "everything she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been all my life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and hears the eyes when the wind changes improvisely and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, it is, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder wounds, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the coat on his back, Unainik can only load 50 pounds at his 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his colleagues launch 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a cow road between the malice.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been all my life,” Unainik declares opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, 30 years old, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest tasks in the world: the one that the human mules of Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, we fulfill our civil duty and believe life!
It may seem unreliable that these verses are part of a menta pills ad, but despite that – or because of that – the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore in early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bottle) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they manage to attract the attention on the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music so that people fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something purely of the internet, so we had to do it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as throwing perfumes with feromones or organizing fast dating vessels.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we think, why don’t we do the most creative possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
The one that does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity licenses and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders' conservation and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 – known as reposition rate – was in 1976.
So why do singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a broader range of career opportunities".
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased loneliness, and to delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to face the decrease of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where abundant xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and grades for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoes box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and disanimate developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoes boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausting days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
However, it acknowledges that the new standards give clearer guidance for developers, who were previously trapped if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step towards the rise of the national birth rate, talking to the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center seems that they won’t have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and education is so, so many people are postponing it,” a young executive says.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to count on my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans are who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line.
and privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the scope of private life that has the right to be protected from any intrusion."
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition to your everyday life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet situations that you’t share offline?
The journal interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and user name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deeper secrets would not upload them to a post," says Jorge, ten-year-old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he has 35 friends on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just raise them,” he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to remote relatives or to my friends quickly,” she says.
No doubt to answer that I would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I would not tell anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” she says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his house or his phone number.
“If they press me or demand me it, I’m just in the bag of my account,” he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is today known as cyberbullying.
A friend of one of my friends were extortioning him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“He only put his privacy.”
Then explain a number of steps to configure your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
I’m going to do it, if I’m wrong or I’m going to do it.
“But I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed,” he said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, Master in Pedagogy by the University of Yale and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, acclaimed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we’re still learning,” he says.
He commented that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
“They also need to be selective when what matters them most is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
“To tell them not to do it doesn’t serve,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you label party photos, do you ask permission to other people to label them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act on line as they do off line.
They are the same rules.
“One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be on social networks,” he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is indispensable for family parents to read the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remembering the children the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandates.
Efe tried on repeated occasions to access the document signed at the UNASUR’s VI Ordinary Meeting of Head of State and Government, but sources from the Chancellor and Presidency pointed out at a start that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later they said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, in the press room, the presidential assembly's soundless video with the message "private session, restricted audio" was only transmitted.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the date, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for greater data.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronunciation of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South American Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima that previously had been announced was not spread.
The official website of ASPA can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities strived to ensure that there were secure broadcast systems for all journalists but limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a court ruling that directs a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will catch and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean couple.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Piñera added, and greeted Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the CIJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had accepted to submit to the failures of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inassistences of the Brazilian presidents, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midnight in Lima.
He read the final document in which he that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were fixed for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that UNASUR countries will “do important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the settlement agreements.”
He said that actions are being pushed to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make more accessible drugs, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters.”
With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand productive matrix and see a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axis of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give greater details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua couple, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in respect the maritime dispute after a CIJ decision, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We’re going to review all these paths, they’re not exclusive, even the Nicaragua treaty will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they are scheduled to attend the appointment of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Likewise, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are UNASUR members, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro témpore presidency of the regional block.
“Suramérica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship”: Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramérica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that the Europeans "morded themselves in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish the South American citizenship that encourage the Unasur member countries.
"There is to get the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as it is already with the members of the Andian Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also showed himself in favour of the Organization of American States (OEA)'s recomposition under the pretext of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give cathedra never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not regreting that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for demanding him to be submitted in his territory to the interrogation for a alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows to do so through a video conference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said there is the risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that I had a small lungs problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health is deteriorated because you are locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This complicates everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the concession of a salvaconduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives tomorrow the salvoconduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow the problem ends.
Correa took advantage of reaffirming himself as a advocate of the freedom of the press and said that what it does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies, which disrupt freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians but the evil journalists based on profits, chantage and extortion,” he said.
In that regard he congratulated that no longer these journalists are "neither the banks nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected, he "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its upcoming elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the golpism covered with legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not done.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute by maritime boundaries held in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept a decision for hard as it is."
In reference to the eventuality that he is present as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
In person I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as in Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that reponsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and therefore we go out of public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me he travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a decline in President Chávez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Head of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was as if a bomb fell to me," he refers to reminding the moment of the announcement, that the doctor tried to make "more soft," without obvious success.
The boy hid him from his family.
She decided to take care of her disease alone and began informing her; with such an effort that she had already celebrated her 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, still many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "abused" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in an appropriate form and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said Head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was evaluated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affection to the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives the HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as it remains in control can live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewed explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is 76 years in average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (an annual report of ONUSIDA), it is also true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That’s how we see it, that’s what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had medication loss the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don’t know their state of infection, i.e. in late stages of the disease.
"Nine of every ten patients come when they already present some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer mass detection tests, to all the people who require it."
In his proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and they don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better to get back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
At present, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponding, I take care of me and the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, let them know as soon as they are HIV-positive, it’s better and if they already have the diagnosis, let them learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
This, his message, summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS this 2012.
Condons behind the showcase
Great are the holes between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively the distribution of condoms has increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are those today, yet, have no access to a condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorrow and valuable judgments of social workers, school guides, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents don't want to be exposed.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only behind the showers and that hundreds are in public bathroom dispatches of the sites that young people frequent.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the chelas and the motel, as governor Emilio González replied, asking him if there would be distribution of preservatives in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, the best thing is to get the condoms closer to those who already practice a sexual activity," he said.

There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th of HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to sexual, 6% to blood and 2% to perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who don’t know it.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeal a ruling that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through a mercantile competition in Mexico, the scene puts a faint precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
Therefore, it would be said that the surviving procedures of the signatures permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, against international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backward to the judgment issued on June 15 last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms indefenses in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties in allende the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
As the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Quebras Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the mercantile competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve unknown international process cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with transnational profile.
In fact, for that purpose the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the vote intercompanions, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial contest the debts that the Vitro filials had with their matrix, would not have achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts have been assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, in addition, is that remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the Cortes of the United States, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is ignored by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this guilty Vitro of the difficult situation he faced from 2008 after the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, stumbling the collapse to the country.
Soon, the signature of the González Sada family will interpose a recourse to reconsideration before the appeal court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of this, i.e. the five magistrates, given that only three voted.
If this does not prosper, the Cerciorare appeal will be claimed that requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing in the case is that the court filed a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("Friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Mercantile Competition Act is detailed, pointing out that the court with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match this with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border cases of insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: they catch Vitro and catch the country.
The General Balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation trade unions against the company's exdue, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots Syndical Association has already found the bottle neck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of the IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been canalized to the purchase of shares from the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Hotel Chain Posadas.
Close to Dragon Mart
Meeting this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal centre of sale and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the wall country, with a calce housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the south-eastern area to oppose the monumental coss that broke down with a part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the shadows against the industry.
The ACTA died.
Submitted by the government a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Commercial Anti-Falsification Agreement, known by his English signs as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the tabloncillo sport and, thanks to it, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the local basketball history as broad as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, player of National Higher Basketball, captured and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hat on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was BSN’s president, National Team’s general manager and federal president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilies that denote his extensive trajectory, so they testify.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones that attends with the greatest excitement are the ones that rememorate his passage through the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years working as co-powered or captured of the franchise.
“These were my best years, the ones I most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it was as an empowered, co-empowered or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at the BSN.
From there onwards, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took office," Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, “I have a very strong player, 6”7” of size.
Do you want it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended the franchisor Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another more.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse it, but already at the distance, since for 1988 it was already federative.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it had to have been bronze not by that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, just as he won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a pall to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to which we won the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the Pan-American de Mar del Plata, we win gold against all the forecasts.
Who has been Puerto Rico’s best player?
Unfortunately, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculín did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That is very difficult.
We had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill’s work.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What has you left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for managers, table officers and arbitrators.
That I am pleased.
What do you do now?
The most I do is listening to music, watching music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and from time to time going to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became worldly famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a scrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avaricy in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved native town of Dallas, representing again the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died at a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I’ll wonder it very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the maximum," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found a malignant tumor in the liver and was submitted to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In her she played Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his magistral interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his highest star.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters on its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectations around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of risky dollars in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million television viewers synthonized it and turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the "MASH" final in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was the cousin of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. made her pregnant and then threatened her to be a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a trapious entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
“I know what I want in J.R’s sheet,” Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, “Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only deal he has lost.
Victoria Principal, the coprotagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone “enormous, inside and out of the screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, the chain.
Soon there was no Warner or TNT pronunciation about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Oriundo of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried luck at the New York theater scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there, she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to attend fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer something of comfort, such as “Do not worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that explores the “End of the World”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible anthem: the end of the "long regressive account" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have attached as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a tax precipient that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last of history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could explode a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic topics and explored how they were compared to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed to give a course, titled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students another option but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, on their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociological career student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and somehow we disacredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple student and West Chester student.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who taught courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuing an exception from a higher authority.
We have an indulgence from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years it has been spoken of many days of the final trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "People will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking to light the date.
Some said they intend to go to holidays "from the end of the world".
“Maybe call some friends so that we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
