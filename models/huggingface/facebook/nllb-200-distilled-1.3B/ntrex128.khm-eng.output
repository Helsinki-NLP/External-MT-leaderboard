Welsh AMs worry about 'Mortal looks'
There has been a bit of silence around some AMs on the request to change their status to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Assembly).
It was caused by a plan to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs go through a political framework that is concerned that it could lead to ridicule.
One AM worker said his team was concerned that it was comparing synonyms to Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp refers to lightning and pwp refers to possibility.
Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh conservative said his team was "broadly open" to the name change, but as noted, it was a slip of the tongue from MWP to Moffat.
In this context, the Welsh w reads similarly to the pronunciation in Yorkshire's English for the letter u.
A parliamentary committee, which is currently considering legislation to name the new bill, said: "It is a final decision that some commentators feel that the MPs have been called as a problem to their own members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 transferred the power to the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of a public consultation on a number of proposals seeking broad support for calling the parliament the Welsh Assembly.
On the AMs' reputation issue, the committee supported the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
It appears that the AMs are proposing other options, but the move comes on the heels of a potential decision that could lead to a headache for presidential candidate Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform bill would include other changes to the way parliament works, including measures to suspend the right to elect AMs and the organisation of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they have a legal debate.
Macedonia votes to hold referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular election was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over its province being called Macedonia.
The people of Athens have long claimed the name of their northern neighbour, which it represents, for a claim to their territory, and have repeatedly argued against attempts to become members of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the contenders for the right to change the name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The nest of silence over Martin's fall was the temple under the struggle of Hallem.
Adam said, "Historically, the old people I talked to said there were bars and temples on every corner".
"Today, it's not".
He said the protests were understandable.
He said, "People today are connected".
"It's not the neighbor's living room anymore, where people go to play".
For the church, he was worried that the money from all the property sales would be gone as long as all the leaders wanted it, and sooner or later they would go back to the old ways they started.
He said the temple could be transformed by a huge palace with different people in multiple rooms that could not help shelter the neighbors.
He said, "Most of the condo buyers in these condos are white people, so it will hasten the day when these temples close completely because it is unlikely that most people will move to these condos, which will become these temples".
The city community in 1870, a decade after Martin's administration, the two churches were erected by white churches before Harlem became a black city.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that once served nearby was named after the tower.
Martin was occupied by a black church under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a strike of retailers on 125th Street, a major thoroughfare for Harlem liquor who refused to hire or advertise to blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but because the villagers of Bojong Janssan planned to rebuild it, they entrusted the castle to the National Trust.
The architect David Johnson, the son of the late John Johnson and the next head of the Martin family, called the castle a "poor man's castle".
Experts who visited the castle in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
Tiffany Ng, a specialist from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world's first organ played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Martin did not replace him.
What has been seen several times in Matin in recent months is a collaboration of architects and chefs, some brought in by the church authorities and others by the Evangelical community.
The chamber in the temple, a local administrative body, was established by the religious leaders, writing that the temple's parish in July, was concerned that the parish would try to send at a cost to the chamber in the temple, even though the chamber in the temple was not related to the rent the architect and the parish master had sent.
Some villagers complained about the lack of transparency on one side of the village.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy after diving into a seagull in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was swimming for sea bass in California as the salmon season approached, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. on the coast of the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then swam back with the team to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just the thrill of a punch, but then he "realized he was screaming, 'I have to stop!'
I have to stop them!
Hammel said he noticed that once he approached the boy, the bone-chilling hammer he was kicked out of.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water", Hammel added, "There's a dragon in the water!"
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed in critical condition.
The species of the attacking spider is unknown.
Marine chief Larry Giles said at a press conference that a whale was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as an endangered whale species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a direct wound to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed the coastal entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Incinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of rhinos in the area, but most of those rhinos are not considered endangered.
The Sainsbury's Project is pushing into the UK grocery market
Sainsbury's is in trouble because Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams have a pedestrianised laundry shop staffed with specialised staff.
As part of a major push into the $2.8 billion UK laundry market, which continues to grow as cars become popular and home appliances decline, the large pedestrianised laundry will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and brought to more stores next year, showing some success.
Investment in the entertainment sector comes at a time when the modern market is looking for ways to use retail space, microwave TVs and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics business offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing lineup, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space, with areas with brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The mall also started to run its own small-scale cosmetics stores so that most of the products are non-animal products, which are in increasing demand for young Chinese shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance brand will be tested in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the shift towards everyday small grocery shopping at supermarkets means that the marketplace must do more to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more like grocery stores as well, as similarly named stores in the supermarket tried to fight Aldi and Lidl's price cuts with more service and not food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitats since it bought the store of the same name two years ago, which it says has supported the sale of the items and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous attempts by the modern market to improve its laundry and pharmaceutical stores have ended in failure.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots in the early 2000s, but the contract ended after allegations of profiteering from its supermarket chemical store.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-unit pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the eponymous Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will follow through on this plan by adding several luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our pedestrianised shops to enhance the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained advisors.
Our yoga network is designed to meet the needs and environments of the attractive and convenient location means that we are now becoming an attractive visitor destination for the old-fashioned way of buying yoga".
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left Furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time to wash their clothes and household items, Mrs. Truly.
The couple's business face has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old performer this morning posted on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones, withdrawing from his brand of gambling at the last minute to focus on a new contract for a house-shop in the mail order business with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "furious" when the TV golden-haired girl confessed in a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to pay attention to their Truly branded homewear and accessories giant.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is predicted to add £11 million to Willoughby's double-digit fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, posted on Instagram to announce her departure, Truly, Jones had jumped out of England to head for a vacation at his home.
A source said: "Truly is at the top of Holly's priority.
It would be her long-term future that would see her through a few more decades.
Her decision to take you out was surprising.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was about to start.
There's a warehouse full of supplies at Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most trusted stars, could cost companies millions of pounds by investing heavily in products ranging from shoes and gifts to home-made clothing and shirts and the potential for further delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Starting as a partner, Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby was to become a brand ambassador for M&S and would replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
A lively conversation, and then we fall in love.
He spoke in a humorous tone about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making statements that some thought would be inappropriate and positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his sarcastic voice, "The news is the news".
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the useless negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "coherent response" from the United States to North Korea's nuclear weapons transition.
Instead, he noted that the US is continuing to apply sanctions pressure.
Trump had a lot of optimistic views in his speech.
He said, "We are doing a great job with North Korea.
We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results through the completion of missile tests, the release of prisoners, and the acceptance of remaining American troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
Trump said, addressing the crowd directly in front of him, "It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get on stage, we're going to have about 200 people standing there".
A tsunami and earthquake strike on an Indonesian island killed hundreds
For example, as a result of the earthquake in Lombok, many foreign NGOs were told they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared as a requirement for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is deploying a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear if foreign workers can work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the International Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Due to the earthquake that Indonesia has always been unable to withstand, the country is still very much ready for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they were not common on other coastal areas.
The lack of siren warning for tsunami waves in Palu, despite the warning being effective, is likely to have caused loss of life.
At its best, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make many industries more resilient.
A rescue ship that was deployed in Lombok aimed to treat earthquake victims and was also on its way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's fractured infrastructure, making it a key part of his election campaign, and he has spent money on numerous tunnels and highways.
However, budget deficits have left Joko's administration frustrated as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from continued religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim population have adopted a more orthodox form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced as Christian and Muslim militias fought in the streets using knives, axes, and other wild weapons.
The view: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is down by a huge margin. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea and his team's goal in a 1-0 win.
He continued to move the ball to his left before the ball hit far forward.
This attempt went high on the ground as the ball ran up the right corner of the court.
In the end, the ball fell on Kepa Arrizabalaga's foot and fell into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "It's just trying to get in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always keep pushing the ball forward as much as possible, so I try to play myself as much as possible".
"I saw Kante come and get the ball and I didn't think much about it and then just scored".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a 25th-minute point from Belgian striker Eden Hazard.
The blue-shirted striker made a pass to Mateo Kovacic on the pitch before returning to centre-half position and running in the middle of Liverpool's goal.
Kovacic was quick to give up in the second half.
He then made a clean drive, bringing Hazard into the net.
Hazard ran to defend and finished the penalty shoot-out behind Liverpool striker Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that several people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of the building due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from the collapsed castle.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55am with a wound at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward to provide evidence.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can capture something on camera to contact us as they may have information that is relevant to our investigation.
A police spokesman claimed that the woman's body was found, that she was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside the house.
At this time, all friends who believed they knew a woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, as police said they were in the process of informing the next victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
At this time, locals are being told that it will be hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She kept saying, "It's scary".
At 2pm, two police vans were inside the police barricade with another outside.
Some officers stood inside the police station, watching the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is requested to provide DM @MerPolCC by calling 101 or contacting Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 citing incident 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament became a lasting memory with a series of re-writes of history.
The expulsion would be the most appropriate punishment for the Taliban-like destruction of many British cultural and religious relics practiced by Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be a target.
The English Civil War destroyers were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell had wrongly sacrificed himself to the actions of Thomas's ancestors in the previous century.
The great representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th century ideas and a piece of history showing that many people still believe it to be valuable.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "There was probably more respect in the late 19th century than there is today for Cromwell, who is revered by many as the defender of Parliament against outside pressure on his cause, the defence of the monarchy.
Whether the representation is entirely accurate is disputed historically.
What is clear is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century led to the continuing development of our nation, and Cromwell is a figure who could well represent the other side of that divide.
His work as a defender of the Lord is also worth greeting and remembering".
Big pig killer kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in northwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man with his last name "Yan" was found dead with a blood clot near a pigsty in a market in Lebanon, Guizhou province.
A pig farmer vaccinated a large number of pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with one of his cousins from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, one of the cousins of the cat found him dead and found the door to the pigsty nearby unlocked.
He said that inside this pig's chest was a big pig with blood on its mouth.
According to reports, a medical examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, the quote is "My great-grandparents' feet are bleeding and leaking".
Security cameras showed Yan walking into the market at 4.40am on Thursday to get his pork chops.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yan's or one of his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was kept away from them to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have been documented.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig rocked a whale farmer to his tractor until his wife was afraid to stay away from the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC that not all pigs are inherently immune, but blood clots can act as "trigger points".
They were just joking.
They're the ones who make the really amazing... they don't want to hurt you.
He said, "You just have to pay them a fair amount of respect".
Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rainfall to the western United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa's strength is weakening as it moves over the cold waters of the northwest coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the western United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and moved 385 miles northwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a tidal wave is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical winds into the northeastern United States.
Storm Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropics interact with the meltwater discharge, which will create heavy rainfall in the northwest in the coming days.
In the region, heavy rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flooding, landslides and landslides in the sand dunes.
Tropical storm clouds will cause rainfall rates to increase to 2 to 3 inches per hour at a point, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 2 and 4 inches of heavy rain is expected in some parts of the Northeast, especially in Arizona.
Flooding can occur due to extreme weather conditions, as heavy rainfall occurs in the tropics.
It would be a serious illness to mix forest to sandy walks with the threat of tropical snow.
Heavy rains can cause mountains to turn into rivers with flood waters and there are thunderstorms that will bring strong winds and dust storms.
The flooding will bring heavy rainfall to some areas along the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than one and a half inches is possible and can cause slightly wetter flooding and mudslides.
This is the first rainfall in the region for the winter.
Some tropical snow and thunderstorms will begin to fall in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before raining heavier on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be poured into the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October saw a sharp rise in temperatures across the United States, while the Arctic had cooler weather but the tropics remained hot.
This can lead to significant temperature variations over short distances.
There is a great example of the remarkable temperature difference in the central United States on a Sunday.
Temperatures differed by nearly 20 degrees between Texas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between Lewis and Des Moines Roads.
In the next few days, the summer heat wave will try to re-emerge and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to start to warm by October, with a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius spreading from the southern lowlands to parts of the southwest.
New York City could reach 80 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through mid-to-early October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's opening.
More than 20 million people watched testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in a 1980s trial by Christine Blasey Ford on Channel 6.
Meanwhile, political confrontations continued with network television broadcasters interrupting regular program writing for Friday's last-minute twist: a deal created by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate panel that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had gotten her drunk and tried to undress her at a high school.
Kavanaugh, in this thrilling testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it wouldn't happen.
It was likely more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday that watched the episode.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
This figure was not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Commercial Networks.
And Nielsen generally had some trouble measuring the number of people in the office.
It's a crowd similar to a football game for a playoff game, a playoff game, or a scholarship game.
Nielsen said Fox News, whose fan base was overwhelmingly in support of Kavanaugh's nomination, led the network to an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC TV was in second place with a total audience of 3.26 million.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure for the Friday episode.
After the Republican Party office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shouted by protesters as he tried to board a train to the courthouse.
He stood with his eyes crossed for several minutes as he was beaten, televised live on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
"Do you think he is telling the truth to this country?
He was told, "You have power when there are too many women without power.
Flake said his office issued a statement saying that before the train closed, he would speak further at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covered in the hours following the court committee's vote to push Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a runoff.
But Flake said he would do so on the understanding that the FBI would review charges against the candidate for next week's nomination, which the minority Democratic Party has been clamoring for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was seen that Republicans would not get the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK PM could accuse critics of "playing politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May may have accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near the same interview with her on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson threatened her Brexit oversight plan, saying one proposal that the UK and EU should collect each other's taxes was "extremely prudent".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a LSU baseball player.
Dyton Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in jail on suspicion of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his ventilator during the fight.
Police recovered the car from the scene and said they found DNA on it that belonged to Simpson, according to a report from CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to prosecutors.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department is leaving the fleeing fugitive's arrest team with Louisiana State Police, the Criminal Division of the State Police, Southern University Police and local citizens to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked local law enforcement for its "diversity and pursuit of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played football for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU football coach Will Wade said his team was "shocked and saddened" by Wayde's death.
Wade said, "This is what you worry about all the time.
The volcano erupts over Mexico City.
Burning ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached several districts in the south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the movement evolved in the crater and it released 18# gas and burned within 24 hours.
The centre has been monitoring wind and earthquake sounds.
Images on social media showed a row of flames on the windshields of some streets in Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noted increasing activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers northeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the automatic vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police to crack down on corruption and thousands of people joined a protest to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's political election over secession.
Masked protesters, disguised as police, swallowed drugs and dropped pesticides, leaving a dark cloud over the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes broke out after police used their batons to stop the fighting.
For hours, pro-independence protesters chanted "Don't forget, don't forget" in front of union protesters chanting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were lightly injured in the protests.
Tensions remain high in the autonomous region a year after the October 1 referendum, declared illegal by Madrid but held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although the turnout was low, and those opposed to secession were overwhelmingly against the election.
According to Catalan authorities, in violent clashes, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The protest continued but was forced to move in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, rather than the electrician who took part in the separation protest with his wife, said he had lost hope of a possible Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of the best times.
I watched my parents get excited about this election, but now we're stuck because he's got a conscience.
Despite a narrow victory in the December local elections, Catalonia's pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year, with its best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic who filmed the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It's getting more and more difficult.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate for elections to the European Parliament is the best way to defeat the criticism of the undermining of democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house was hit by truck
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 pm.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
The horn can also be fired at a truck at some points.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was scored
Livingston's upset victory came as a huge shock to Rangers, as Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as captain of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike showed the difference, while Gary Holt's team moved into the next row with Hibernian in minutes.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season and faced the leaders Hearts for whom they would score 8 points next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their non-consecutive run in the league to six games under Holt, who has remained the winningest coach since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost the opportunity in front of a crowd.
Holt's team should have been ahead before they scored with their lead, which made the Rangers all the trouble.
Scott Robinson scored again with his hard-fought effort across the front of the goal to score a goal, but Alan Lithgow was able to lead his team well after a goal to defender Craig Halkett.
The hosts were happy to have Rangers play in front of them knowing they could make the spectators trouble.
And it's the character that the big entries come in.
Rangers received a free kick and Livingston made an opening pitch, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly forming Menga, who scored a goal and scored from the centre of the table.
At that stage, the Rangers managed to score points but faced an unmanageable defender and goalkeeper Liam Kelly, who rarely encountered major problems.
That form continued into the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos's effort to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored a large number of goals from Livingston's play.
The scores continued to enter the Livingston team scoring table and were subsequently broken down as two penalties after Halkett's game to bowler Glenn Middleton and one for the ball were scored.
The 'visible character' of the Livingstons - An Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great ballplay and results for Livingston.
For one man, they played perfectly, which continues to exceed expectations on this track.
Their style of play and ball management has changed little since their return to the top flight, but a great reputation has gone to Holt for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Team captain Halkett was keen to prepare a well-balanced defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet.
However, the Rangers had little momentum.
As well as having been under Gerrard's coaching many times, they have fallen short of those principles.
Their last goal was a deficit - just as they beat the hosts and it was a surprise for Rangers to score in the middle of the table.
In the early 20th century, the German government was forced to abandon the construction of a railway line.
There was a warmth and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Armenia in an attempt to repair ties between NATO allies.
They failed to address issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership in the European Union.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters lined up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the Armenian government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protest reflected a split in the audience, with some Turkish Germans praising the heroes while others deriding the oppressors.
Truck crash in Dijon: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a truck in Long.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Devon, east of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped the bus and the medics rushed to the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came several months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Road, about an hour away from the collision on Saturday.
City police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions have been made and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Prison officials said six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison.
The disturbance broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30pm on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were brought in to deal with the chaos of being trapped with eight inmates and a group of people being held.
Several officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Prison staff with special training have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and of course those responsible will be handed over to the police and may be in prison for longer.
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, a rebel official was called to jail to deal with a major riot after an employee was attacked with a grenade.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (dry areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is what could happen early next week as Hurricane Hurosa Rosa's residual energy sweeps through the desert plains, causing immediate flooding disaster.
The National Weather Service issued flash flooding warnings on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, eastern and eastern Nevada, eastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to make a run to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in an article that there have only been ten cyclones that remained tropical storms or degraded conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border. "
The National Hurricane Center recently forecast 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with a sustained amount of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the plateau, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of snowfall, with total amounts ranging as much as 4 inches apart.
Relieving areas facing sudden flooding, the rains of Hurricane Rosa could be a boon as the area is experiencing drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the plains are experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Management Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona alone is experiencing severe drought, the second highest rate, according to a report from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to landslides across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Storm Rosa remained strong Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving northwest at 12 mph.
The storm is hitting cold waters in the Pacific and so its strength will decrease.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or so.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico could be a serious consequence leading to major flooding.
3 to 6 inches of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the Sonoran Desert, up to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move northeastward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, a tropical depression that will travel toward Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center said that "the main disaster expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the Sonoran Desert and the southeastern coast of the United States".
These rains are expected to create a life-threatening situation with flash floods and landslides in sand plains and landslides in mountainous areas, etc.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found dead from his injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital as he was in "extreme pain".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers appealed to anyone who could film the incident on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered "pain and anger" from the Democratic Party
Trump stated at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, "The election for Judge Kavanaugh was an election to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and angry tactics".
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered "pain and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress last Thursday, refuting and denying the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual abuse decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the glory and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
He told a crowd of West Virginia supporters, "A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the most legitimate legal mind of our time as a lawyer with a record of public service".
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
He said, "Five weeks after the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting with the other great candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats had a mission to "deter and obstruct".
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the first procedural vote on the Senate nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed by Indonesia earthquake, tsunami as death toll rises
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed and many more drowned when a massive tsunami hit the coast as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on a sandy beach in Palu on Friday when a 6-metre (18-foot) wave swept over the beach at dawn, killing dozens and destroying everything on the journey.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said briefly at a press conference in Jakarta that "when there was a threat of tsunami on Saturday, people continued their activities on the shore and did not immediately flee and they became victims".
Nugroho said: "The tsunami did not come by itself, it overwhelmed, overwhelmed houses, blew everything on the ground. Moreover, the tsunami travelled through the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast".
"Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and were saved", he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial images released by disaster agencies showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes are known to have occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau for Technical Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the magnitude of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow channel, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the extent of the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said some of the bodies of the victims were found under the rubble of the building, and 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said the number of injuries and deaths and the extent of damage could be much higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Nugroho said communication was "completely cut off without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people live there" and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
It is said that this is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The agency on Saturday came under heavy criticism for not alerting of a tsunami wave hitting Palu, but officials said the tsunami arrived at the time of the warning.
In a photo shared by the likes of the photo on social media, a man on the top floor of a tower was shouting a frightening warning of the tsunami's approach to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water broke through the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to match the concentration of images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages and communications disruptions around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other essential items.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It was terrible.
Doseba said that while World Vision staff from Donggala made it safely to Palu, where the staff were throwing in the trash with all the colored ribbons placed in the courtyard of their offices, they encountered a scene of destruction on the street.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed".
It was terrible.
Despite the aid groups' slow start to disaster relief, some complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to operate if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "It is still a provincial-level disaster.
When the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can be open to international help, but that's not the case yet".
On the second night of the Palu island after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, their friends and family are still missing and they are hopeful that their loved ones will have a chance to put the bad news of the natural disaster away.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from a dirty pool.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stoned for two days with her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team, trained two student gymnasts who were preparing for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mandagi added that the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He said, "As a senior figure in the world of charity, I have my own emotional responsibility".
Gendon described how within hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel being circulated in his cable car community, he sent a WhatsApp message to a Palu competitor attending a beach party.
However, his message barely saw a pink flag instead of a yellow flag.
He said, "I guess that means the message wasn't delivered".
$26,750 stolen during the loading of an ATM in Newport, Levee
According to a report from the Newport Police Department, a robbery on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's pensioner who was depositing money into an ATM in Newport at Levee.
The driver cleaned the ATMs in the recreation environment and prepared to give more money. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a release.
While he was working, another man ran out behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for transportation.
According to the release, witnesses found several suspects on the run, but police did not confirm how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Commonly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, goes by the alias Ye and used his eighth studio album, released in June.
The move came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to debut his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled due to "psychological reasons".
In addition to becoming the spelling of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
West stated earlier this year: "I believe the word 'Ye' is a commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'".
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, meaning unique to the word Ye, right, right living, reflecting our good, our bad, our misunderstandings, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the few rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without the acronym and capitalization.
AMLO Mexico vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
The military fired on a peaceful protest in the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people as a left-wing student movement took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to those who study and opening free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should be giving a double-edged sword to A.I. projects.
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active on intellectual property issues, the United States should double its funding in the field.
Various voices from different parts of the US government have made announcements about AI projects, although the US generally lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the number one AI technology by 2030.
"The dual AI research budget is a good start because other countries are far away from the U.S., and we are looking for new opportunities in AI", Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that the dual funding could increase the chances of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States.
Lee is the co-author of "The Great Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that beat American Othello's top player, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and a branch manager in China.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technology challenges such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics development project and asked for another delay to help identify future prospects.
Lee said researchers in the US often struggle to get government funding.
Lee said, "It's not China that is taking away academic leaders, it's business".
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired mentors or influencers from many universities to work on AI projects in recent years.
Lee said changing immigration policy could also help the United States increase its efforts.
He said, "I think the green card should be automatically given to AI graduates".
The Chinese State Council released its next-generation enterprise development plan in July 2017.
Lee said the China Foundation for Natural Sciences provides human capital funding at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that have provided funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint intelligence center that would involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a commission on intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
To date, NSF has invested more than $100 million a year in AI project research.
Meanwhile, the US bill that sought to establish a national security committee on the dictatorship has seen no action in recent months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday on a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a solution to a decades-long conflict with Greece that has blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has denied its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opposition groups claimed that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the minority of Macedonia's majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a campaign of protests raised doubts whether voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
Question on the referendum: Do you want to remain a member of the EU by accepting a deal with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a cost to continue entry into institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the few countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old from Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of this country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the EU charter because it means a safe life for all of us".
Despite the lack of legal precedent, many lawmakers said they would respect the results of the election to make it decisive.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority vote in the House.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1pm.
However, the turnout was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe".
Macedonian leader Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change that will pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and takes a seat in front of a stand set up by those who will be voting in the referendum.
Kavadarkov stated: "We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join our leadership not through the service portal".
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to turn us into Macedonia, we can spread to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the European regional equation.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO members will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
Zaev said after the vote count: "I am confident that the majority of votes will be in favour because 80 percent of our people will support the European Union and NATO".
He said the "consensus" result was "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said that 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which was below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian state television Telma found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participants must be 50 percent aligned with a vote.
The failure to hold the referendum would represent the first serious attack on the policies of a Western liberal government since it took office in May last year.
Viewer: Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero walks through the entire defence of Brighton
Strikers Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent the defender to Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous in scoring their goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a half-time kick at the start of the match.
He fought off three of Brighton's defenders before throwing a pitch.
Aguero then saw four men in blue shirts surrounding him.
He pushed a forward's neck before running out of the Brighton goal.
He then pushed a touchdown to his left, which Sterling missed.
The English winger used a first down to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to drive into Brighton goalkeeper Mathew, scoring a goal in the right corner of the net.
Pep Guardiola, the city manager, told reporters that Aguero was experiencing some problems with his foot.
 We talked about his game for about 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
At that time, we were lucky that he scored a point.
But it was because of Sterling, who was the first choice for the Sky Blues in the Premier League.
That's what got the goal in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a good shot in Brighton in that game.
He passed the ball well to Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sen pushed the ball a little before passing it to Stalingrad to deflect the ball to the defensive end from a distance.
The Sky Blues ran to get the ball in the end zone just before it was forced out.
The Champions League final will be played at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play hardball to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force any other start.
But the ever-competitive Rogers hoped to get a game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there was a playoff tie for the Rockies, the most dominant team in the NL West, the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies earned enough points to play their way forward in a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still waiting to see their championship come in the first round.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can poll the atmosphere here in Denver to the crowd and other teams who will be the best I can play this year".
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start on Sunday, but have provided details to the players for the game.
The striker will start his 34th game with the ball starting on Thursday and will be playing his usual game on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in the game.
A rally, a gathering of Trump supporters in West Virginia
The president made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court's selection of Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done is at risk in November.
There are only seven weeks left before an important election in our lives.
It's a big election, and I said I didn't want to do it, but I had to, so I went everywhere to find the best candidate.
Trump continued, "You see the Democrats who are against the rose, now you see them.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see their lust for power and their greed.
They don't care about those who are suffering, who are struggling to gain power and control, and what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said that Democrats have always had a mission: resistance and deterrence.
He said, "And you've seen them in the last four days", he called the Democratic Party "a group full of anger, anger and hatred and no morality".
He addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling out Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a call that surprised fans and made them very unhappy.
Are you waiting for her answer?
Is it you who brought the documents to light?
Oh, my God.
No, no, I remember - that was the worst kind of prophetic language - the worst kind of prophetic language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a major party.
They don't agree with you when you say what's in your heart.
When the Momentum activists in my party voted against me, it was nothing to be surprised about.
By the way, I was the last Labour MP who was told we were not welcome because we spoke from our hearts.
My colleague, Congresswoman Joan Ryan, received a similar offer of treatment because she was a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the challenge to me is to criticize me because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of economic policy, there is a national security responsibility in Europe, so to speak, on the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday meant that we wanted the outcome of the meeting to be cohesive and fruitful.
In the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the Friday night meetings have been pretty much the same.
But sadly, many of the meetings that have promises of political, soft, and humble messages have been effectively ignored and never started.
It is clear that different views are no longer accepted in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on whether they are acceptable or not, depending on the party leadership.
This started after Jeremy became the leader, and he was a former colleague of mine, someone who I used to think I shared a common political vision with, someone who started to expect me to do things that were completely different from what I had previously done, to lead a position that I had never agreed to, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public, and no matter what I say, there are always abuse on social media, calling for the removal of political censorship, telling me that I should no longer be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because some of the opinions I have are political.
I admire the courage and dedication of my colleagues who face abuse and racism every day but never despair.
The thing that frustrates me most in this era of politics is that the rate of rape is so high.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance and acceptance of diversity.
The fact is that we are no longer the largest party, and with the vote of no confidence or the change in the electoral law, the party has become smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to be submissive, not judgmental, so I won't have a problem.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, which was born out of the Thatcher government's response to the failure of my large class to thrive, I have worked to provide better public services to those who need them most - whether they are councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden from my politics, including the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who does not understand my policies and what is not in line with the current leadership.
To those who supported the subject on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country is seeking Brexit, which will affect our families, businesses and public services, I don't see why I should waste my time and energy on complaining to the Labour Party leadership.
But one real message I want to say, not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my members, whether Labour or not: I am proud to have served you and I promise that no threat of non-voting or any political advantage will ever stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr defeated Melrose 38-17: Ayr wins the top spot
The last two attempts may have resulted in a draw, but there is no doubt that A's should have won the Premier League game against Tennent.
Now they are at the top of the table, the most undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was their great defense, as well as a good holding opportunity, that the hosts and coach Peter Murchie should be excited about.
He said, "They have tested our game so far and we have not lost yet, so I have to be happy".
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations, the Eers are taking a much better chance than we are".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try and a conversion by Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but Scottish Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowed Mel Bagrose to score and Jason Bagrose missed the cut.
Climo helped the Bears to the lead, scoring a penalty in the first half before the player scored a solo try to give the Bears a 17-5 lead at halftime.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoreless lead and a red card by Baggot cut the lead to five points.
A collision caused Ruaridh Knott to suffer a serious injury and was sent off, and since the start of the replay, the team has been able to move forward with the winning goal by Stafford McDowall, who is the top scorer.
A's interim captain Blair Macpherson was given a penalty, and Melrose scored more points by Bruce Colvine at the end of a tense game.
The hosts were back in action when Struan Hutchinson was given a wild-card for catching Climo without touching off the penalty line, MacPherson pushed from behind the Ayr's lead.
Klimt hit the ball, which he did from the start of the second half, after Kyle Rowe saved a box kick from David Armstrong and sent Gregory Henry to score the fifth goal of the game.
The actor in the still game is looking to take on a new career in the restaurant industry.
The actor in the game, Ford Kieran, seems to want to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been named the manager of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
They announced that the ninth series was the final one in the show, and apparently Kiernan was planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan was interested in joining the rising restaurant business in Glasgow.
 The sea is ours: Belgium hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific
A sailor walks into a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hoisted the blue sea flag.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is inscribed with the slogan: "By right the sea is ours".
To take it back is a duty.
Across the landlocked country of Bolivia, there are vivid memories of a beach lost to Chile in the bloody resource wars of the 19th century - as well as the desire to sail again to the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes have remained high for decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian ambassador, said: "Bolivia has a dynamic, a spirit of unity and calm and expects a positive outcome".
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice's decision through the country's mainstream media, hoping that the court in The Hague will believe Bolivia's claim that after decades of consensus negotiations, Chile should be responsible for negotiating Bolivia's right to sovereignty in the seas.
President Evo Morales, a popular Bolivian national who faces a controversial re-election bid next year, is also dependent on the court's ruling on Monday.
He vowed in late August: "We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor, and if it does, it will make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to divide Chilean territory and that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said that the fact that the decision by the International Court of Justice came only six months after the last hearing showed that the case was "unfair".
Rather than benefiting Bolivia, the last four years may have set the country back.
Zarate said that the problem of access to the sea was manipulated by the Bolivian government.
She said Morales's rhetoric had damaged Chile's reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will be able to continue talking, but it will be very difficult to have a dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in La Paz, rejected the idea that the court's decision was too slow and irregular.
He said Monday was a day that would bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of dissent in the common interest.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains Latin America's most popular president, is using the sea for political gain.
He added that Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
This decision is an opportunity to show that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says no denuclearization until it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not denuclearize if it did not trust Washington.
He said this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be in the process of resuming a failed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "daydream" to believe that continued US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would lead to North Korea's defeat.
Washington was wary of the announcement, fearing Pyongyang would not disarm first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are keen for a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is struggling to abandon nuclear weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A Paris fashion show show featured the latest in a series of mass-market masks that were displayed on the main street next to you.
If you want to increase your helmet collection or wear a mask all day, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a surprisingly large-sized hat collection for their SS19 collection on the sidewalk, set to debut at Paris Fashion Week.
The hats worn for the fashion show hit Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their unique hats to the fashion show floor.
The unusual helmet, made by Valentino, is a large, elongated helmet with a large animal-like mask that covers the model's face.
Other oversized pieces of clothing are like a candy bar, with a sweet toothbrush and some honey - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also presents a strange version of the puzzle - one that takes place around Halloween.
The multi-colored mask has a wide lip and is similar to the Hannibal Lecter face, unlike the haute couture face.
The other mask is shaped like a swimsuit mask, with a tube and a skirt, while the other mask looks like a long, curved frame.
And if you're going to go ahead with that big fashion statement, you're in luck.
The motorist predicts that the big-shouldered helmets will be popular and will be sold on the highways near you.
The La Bomba-sized, two-feet wide, leaf-shaped hat was worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The creative idea behind the large, wordless hat, which became popular on social media, led to another major innovation at the fashion show - a beach walker bag made from a leaf that was almost as big as the model wearing it.
The purple leaf case, decorated with leaf-like foliage with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the SS19 label's Jacquemus 'La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "We are looking forward to seeing big beach hats and bags on the highway for this coming summer as fashion designers have made a huge impact, so it will be difficult to respond to the demand for such a large amount of material".
John Edward: Language skills are important for people all over the world.
Scottish private schools maintained their best academic records, and this record continued in 2018, along with another outstanding test result, which was character enhancement and academic success in sport, the arts, dance and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to students and their parents.
The private school aims to prepare its students for further education and post-secondary education for their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
In the field of education, in particular, in the area of designing and implementing curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, that language goes into his heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the latest test results this year, we can see that language is in the top tier with the highest rates in private schools.
The school's total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the highest marks.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received A's in Chinese, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will need in the future.
Many languages chosen as subjects are given equal value to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in private curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that the reason employers have difficulty recruiting staff is 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
There are many future jobs that require multiple languages, so these language skills are fundamental in the business language universe.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will be truly equal in the future to having a skill that is so much needed.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners from different countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge in the job market.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 40,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language fluently enough to communicate, and French was the only language spoken by a mere two percent, at 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is so important for children today.
Knowing many languages, especially those in developing economies, will help equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
Each school in Scotland will have a different language curriculum.
Some schools will focus more on ancient and contemporary languages, although other schools will teach languages that are thought to be most important for the UK and as we look to 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there are many languages that you can choose to learn from private schools, and the teaching staff at those schools are all experts in these fields.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing learning environments that will nurture children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
At this time, it is indisputable in the context of globalization that language is so important to the future of any country, so all of this should be reflected in the whole educational system.
Of course, modern languages should be considered a "specialty" of international relations.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it the best you can.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
The Lakers were first drafted by the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans' anticipation for basketball player LeBron James, who will make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers, has come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes they will play is not yet determined.
Walton said on the Lakers' website that it could be anywhere from one minute to 47 minutes.
Lakers point guard Mike Trudell tweeted that James would be playing within the allotted number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers for the preseason schedule.
He said, "I don't need a preseason game at this stage of my career to prepare".
The video was posted on the official YouTube channel of the Virgin Islands.
President Donald Trump began rallying campaign supporters tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of Trump's five rallies next week, with several other locations being attended, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for the election to meet the Supreme Court's criteria, Trump is intent on building support for the midterm elections because Republicans face losing control of Congress by the time the election is held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you watch it online?
A Trump supporter rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump supporters' rally in West Virginia online, live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to settle this week's trial with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on sexual misconduct charges, delaying the Senate confirmation vote by a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this large-scale rally is to help Republicans who are facing the November election get a boost.
According to a press release from President Trump's campaign, the five-day rally next week is aimed at "promoting the many volunteers and supporters that the Republican Party seeks to protect and increase the majority votes they have in the Senate and House of Representatives".
A Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters that control of Congress was crucial to his character, as the president would travel to as many states as possible as we approached the hectic campaign season.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at Baseball Stadium could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain support from the Pittsburgh media network.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit to Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the election.
According to a reporter, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, "It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president is trying to help him in the election".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage for the fight, hoping to advance to a match on Sunday
After three games of the round robin, a four-man matchup on Saturday afternoon was a spectacular showing of the Ryder Cup.
The speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed
So what can we say, what is the momentum now?
Jordi Spieth walked up excitedly and said, "They're six points ahead and now there are four points left, so I think we've lost a little bit of momentum".
Europe is tied at four points and 10 points left to win.
T-Squirt said that the Americans felt they had been under-exercised, as they needed a lot of encouragement, especially the way that T-Squirt and Justin Thomas played together all day and each boasted three points out of four.
The goalkeeper has mastered the game from the starting position to the last hole of the tee to green and the first set of goals.
The cheers grew louder as his round-tripper continued to score a key hole-in-one to tie the score at four as he and Thomas fell two after two.
His goal scoring, which helped them to a 15-game win, caused a similar roar to the screaming that he was convinced the Americans would not leave.
He said: "You have to work hard and worry about your game.
Every player has left.
18 The mark is the mark.
The player with the most points over the last two days is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champion.
Europe's most beloved and strange thing is four-for-four and you can't go wrong.
Mollywood were the only pair not to bogey the hole on Saturday night, but they also avoided bogeying on Saturday morning, Friday night, and the Berkmen (both 10th and 18th holes) on Friday morning.
That kind of running and the fact that their energy is flowing out of the crowd shows that they are the players to compete for on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to secure a great European victory when the sun goes down in the National League like Whitworth or Molinari.
What you want is for both to come out at the same time on different holes.
Talking about the glory of Europe seems to be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played slow with Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball player, when he was pitched to Alex Noren.
Bogey and Dodge on the front nine put the Spaniards and Swiss into a hole they could not get back up.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of the door.
The gameplay of the Fable (playing two-sided in the morning) and the Fassam (playing in the afternoon) is very interesting to watch because of the interaction between the two sets of guesses, the advice they give that they did not give and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team now and took the lead on the final day, but this final also showed that the Americans had the courage to fight a battle that some countries, especially the Americans, had doubted.
Europe won the final day 10 to 6.
Europe will be evenly matched on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning the final on Saturday and the final, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Tommy Fleetwater and Glenn Siskumolinari both led two victories over Tiger Woods to score a total of four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bean's European side, bidding for the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, beat the Americans in the morning final 3-1.
The United States struggled further in the finals, winning two games, but they still couldn't afford to lose.
Jim Ferrick's team needed eight points from a game-by-game or singles tie on Sunday to retain the title.
Fleetwood was the first new European goalkeeper to score four points in a night, while he and Molinari, who were named after the second pair to play on the weekend, scored four points from the opening match in Ryder Cup history.
After knocking out both Watts and Peter Bridges in the final, they beat Watts and American rookie Jason DiCampbio perfectly in a 5 & 4 tie.
Watson, who finished two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance but still lost 19 of his 29 games in the finals and the finals, losing seven straight.
Joss St. Rose took a break from the morning game and returned to his partner, Henry Stenson, in the final, 2-1, to the world No. 1 and No. 3 ranked players, Dudley Stinson and Brooks Cooper.
Europe is not playing well, even on the pleasant and comfortable terrain of the western suburbs of Paris.
The three-time defending champions, Jordan Spitzer and Justin Thomas, put the Americans on a two-point lead on Saturday.
They won 2 & 1 over Spain's Ian Poulter in the final and later beat Poulter and Remy Khelroy 4 & 3 in the final, losing by two strokes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, even though the hosts needed a draw to keep the trophy.
After holding onto the second best position for two days, Sunday's comeback looks like it will be even more brutal.
North Korea says there is no way it can disarm unilaterally without mutual trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions on the country were further undermining confidence in the United States and that there was no way the country would abandon its nuclear weapons arbitrarily under any circumstances.
Ryongho told the annual conference that North Korea had taken important steps in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "However, we have not seen any response from the US".
If we cannot trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such a situation, there is no way we will disarm first.
He continued to complain that Washington was still opposed to North Korea's "phased" approach to denuclearization, and that North Korea should have been relieved of sanctions when it took further action. His main statement was that he did not deny the nuclear disarmament in isolation from his own hands, as Pyongyang had done before.
He was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during the first-ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to ensure North Korean security.
North Korea has been and is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States demands the elimination of nuclear weapons first and increases the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, and also opposes declaring an end to the war, he said.
The realization that punishment can lead to failure is a daydream of people who don't know us well.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to create a growing mistrust between them.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leaders confirmed at the UN earlier this week.
The minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that "if the party to the denuclearization issue is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula is not in jeopardy".
However, the tone of his speech was a stark contrast to last year when he told the U.N. Congress that North Korea's missile-launched U.S. targets were inevitable after President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, turned to praising Kim for his courageous disarmament measures, but he also said there was more North Korea had to do and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he had no clear timeline for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, five months - that's fine".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should give approval to Pyongyang for the measures it has implemented.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and successfully until we know the complete elimination of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has consistently pushed for sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to thwart attempts to spend on Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Pham Binh met Ri outside the UN and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to host the second summit.
Pyongyang has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying what he had achieved was that North Korea within hours had convinced him that there were "excessive demands" on him.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile sites and nuclear facilities if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate or appropriate measures" he was seeking were Trump's security guarantees, which he promised in Singapore, and toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has its undergraduate students getting enough sleep in an effort to combat the rampant culture of coffee drinking, sleep-deprived study, and sheep-like eyes.
One study found that students at one of the world's top universities often don't know even the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this training after a discussion about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the discussion, a student came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this when I'm in the fourth grade?"
He told The Telegraph that she said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which launched for the first time this year, explains to students about the habits of good sleep that it helps with learning and sports practice as well as improves students' overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to offer the course after finding that some students did not get enough sleep during the week.
The one-hour course is related to the work of the Syrian attraction.
In one section there is a picture of a living room where students are asked to click on a cup of coffee, a pair of shoes and a book that tells about the effects of caffeine and light and how labor is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep habits.
In another part, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school environment with interactive images encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
Prof Czeisler added: "We know that this course will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking.
A culture of pride in getting people to sleep is still present.He added that modern technology and increased pressure on students means that their sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said ensuring that students get enough sleep should be their secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. He added that it helps prevent weight gain because not getting enough sleep puts the brain in a hungry state, making them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California native studying biochemistry and biophysics, helped Czeisler organize the course last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
They said the training made them visible and inspired them to push for a school-wide curriculum.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all students to complete a similar program before joining the competing institution.
Professor Geisler suggested that students should consider clocking, such as when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the effects of blue light emitted by electronics and LED lights, which can cause brainwaves to misfire, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga knocks out Gerrard
Rennes suffered another defeat when a striker from Limoges scored to keep St. Germain down 1-0 at Livingston.
1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side made Gerrard lose his second of 18 games as manager to give his side eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored the game-winning goal seven minutes into the first half and the Rangers' lineup seemed to be in no shape.
While Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston moved up to third and were behind Hibernian by a margin of goals scored.
And it could be even more of a problem for the referee, after the goalie, the swimmer, Spencer, was treated for a head injury after an object was thrown off the field to hit him.
Gerard made eight substitutions for the team that went through the A-League and entered the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Hult, on the other hand, was joined by Levi 11, who scored a hat-trick last week and his full-body shot left his opponent almost breathless.
Rovers managed the ball, but Winton did better with the ball they managed.
They should have scored in the second minute when Menga's dismissal sent Scott Pittman in and sent Alan McGregor to score, but the line could not take advantage.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow threw the penalty kick out behind goal.
Rennes managed to control the ball, but hopefully it was more than believing in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have received a penalty kick in the 25th minute as he and Steven Lawless jumped together, but the referee, Steven Thomson, dismissed Columbia's claim.
Rains managed just two shots on the pitch, but goalkeeper Liam Kelly, a former goalkeeper, was unhurt by striker Lassana Coulibaly and resisted a penalty from Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening 34th minute of the game for the Leafs could be the turning point of the game, no one can deny that they deserved what they put in.
Rennes again failed to hold with the ball as the game started.
Scott Arfield had no reaction, while Declan Gallagher hit a field goal to knock out Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick up the Menga for a simple finish.
Coulibaly took Ryan Kent and the trade worked immediately as the wing-back was tied to Morelos, but striker Kelly ran out of their lineup to intercept.
But Winstone continued to attract visitors to their favourite sport, while Lithgow and Halkett were the only two to touch the ball at the line of scrimmage.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stage, but McGregor showed a dismissive stance before Lithgow worked his lead out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton's replacement had another claim for a penalty as he ran into a fight with Coop, but Thompson was again out.
The Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And this is a site from Sunday morning in Germany: September 30, 1882 today, 136 years ago and counting... and the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of the instrument known as the Geiger Counter.
The importance of physics, unprecedented since the advent of the computer, has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, played by unlikely scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
ROGERS: It's a very powerful tool used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of the atoms that are given off by radioactivity in the mineral.
IW: It's definitely popping up right now!
In 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday, H. G. Hager died.
But the invention of this device bears his name to this day.
New cancer drugs can teach the immune system to see through the cells of the spleen.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to detect and kill cancer cells.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize and recognize the pathogenic cells, which is part of the treatment.
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient by changing them in a laboratory.
Then they can look at a common protein, which could be a lot of cancer, and then reattach it.
An experimental vaccine has been shown to be successful in patients with advanced cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize germ cells found that her ovarian cancer was completely gone in just over 18 months.
The technique involves removing immune cells from a patient, modifying them in a laboratory so that it can "detect" a common protein that can be a multiple-cancer agent called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
If we follow Professor Berzofsky from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who said, "Our results show that we have a great vaccine".
Professor Ghebrezhsky explained that HER2  promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.
Similar methods of extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells have worked effectively in the treatment of various types of leukemia.
Kanye West started out by reaching out to his fans by wearing a MAGA mask after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out so well.
Kennedy West expressed his dissatisfaction in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night after a major performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After he sang his third song that night, "Ghost Town", and he wore a sign that said "Make America Great", he spoke out against Democrats and raised his support for Trump.
"So many times, I've spoken to white people and they said, 'Why do you like him, he's a racist?'"
He said, "Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL opened with Matt Damon, who in Hollywood mocked Brett Kavanaugh's story before the Senate Judiciary Committee over a sexual assault complaint by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not televised, the video footage of West was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Roy was trying to tease West for posting such a video.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes about his costume.
 They made me sin behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this mask".
They have sinned against me!
He said, according to the Washington Examiner, they said I was in a trauma unit.
West continued, "Will you go to rehab?" saying he should "put on my soap mask because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try to love a little.
His comments led to a double-digit surge of dissatisfaction from viewers, and the SNL cast member seemed embarrassed. There were reports that someone there told reporters, "The whole studio was dead silent".
West is a student who was hired to replace former singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mark Miller, died a few days before the concert.
West had a lot of doubts with performing the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
Weiss was endorsed by TPUSA's conservative leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest of brave minds: Thank you for speaking your mind".
But talk show host Karen Hunter insisted on the title, "Mr. West, he's that guy, and he's amazing".
But I have decided not to encourage anyone (by simply buying his books or his clothes or supporting his art) that I believe is fostering an accepting ethos of change and expression that is harmful to my community.
He has the right to freedom.
She added, "So are we".
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now officially a celebrity known as Kenny West.
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's Twitter adventures, also known as Puff Daddy and Puffy and P Diddy.
Following the events of the rapper Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, and of course the legendary Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and the artist was then known as Prince.
The alleged attempted murder at the Belfast Hotel, which involved a collision
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a hotel in east Belfast on Friday.
Tpolice said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has attacked being a toxic man.
Keith Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the misconception of macho male characters as brutal, saying acting roles in stories often make boys feel they have to be brutal to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he was convinced something was wrong and questioned how to deal with the issue of the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married actress Rose Leslie, the 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, admitted that he felt "very much the need" to address the issue.
He said, "I personally feel that it is very necessary now, what is the problem of being a man who is too cruel?"
What do we teach our boys who are men when they grow up to face the problems we see today?
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity caused by its own male characters.
He said, "What is it that comes out of the womb? What can a man say?
What is being taught on TV screens and in the streets that makes boys feel that they have to be in a certain category to be a man or a real man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our generation -- how do we change this?
Because it's obvious that young people have a problem.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be writing a script for Game of Thrones before or after the series ended this summer, saying he had already completed the story, which was done in a horse-mounted village.
Beginning in November, Keith will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his reunion with his wife, Princess Rose, to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, "I met my wife in this play, so in that way it gives me a family, my future and my life from this point on".
Ross plays Ygritte, the twin of Keith's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy drama.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of a country estate surrounding the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV or AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials said that more than 820,000 people in the country were affected.
There were approximately 40,000 new cases reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of these new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike previous cases.
Initially, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of HIV-containing blood.
Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of HIV cases had been reduced to almost zero.
However, year on year, the number of people living with both HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a complex issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to remain at high levels.
Because of the country's liberal values, research studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmission of the disease results from a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make available drugs to treat HIV as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senator data, strongly criticizing it as "dangerous propaganda" and "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday announced her dismissal of allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Congressman's Wikipedia page.
Los Angeles Democrat politician claims that the abuse is increasingly coming from professional groups and far-right websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies and the most hateful lies".
The information released by the report included the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Congressmen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are in Utah.
The news surfaced online on Thursday, where it was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill website during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
The news broke at a time when three senators were questioning Brett Kavanaugh's response.
According to Hill, which reported that radical websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and released information about Waters' staff members.
Ms. Vorthers continued, "The baseless allegations are completely untrue and are a complete lie".
 My staff members are only threatened with their identity, personal information and safety due to these false and false allegations, I am not responsible for the disclosure of this information
This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete lie.
Waters's remarks prompted immediate online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Ari Fleischer writes: "This rejection is done in anger".
This shows that she is not qualified to be a member of the parliament.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They should not be so rigid.
They should not question the motives of the accuser.
They will not be harmed, nor will they be silenced.
Ari Fleischer appeared to be comparing Ms. White's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be excessively angry during a speech on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to remove Waters from office in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He applauded on social media, tweeting: "It's a big deal if it's true".
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims".
She further said, "We will ensure that the offenders are exposed and they will be held legally accountable for all their actions which are destructive and harmful to all members of my staff".
Rating: The film is a satirical take on Johnny English Strikes Again, starring the male lead Rowan Atkinson, who has no power.
It is now traditional to explore the significance of the UK's withdrawal from European membership in new films that have an English-style perspective and that could benefit the re-creation of the rights to the action-adventure comedy-drama series with Johnny English - which began in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with a new sequel, Johnny English Reborn.
Is self-deprecating talk about the theme of "If we are as thin as rubbish, will it become the country's new export opportunity?"
At any rate, the English gentleman, who was a funny, funny, funny-looking man, was given a second chance to re-publish his novel - his name is a symbol of nothing more than a comic-book creation for a non-English speaking country, but there are people who love to see such films.
He is, in fact, a shiny secret agent who, despite his bizarre disguise, resembles the fictional Clouseau a little bit like Mr. Bean and is as tough as the Chariots of Fire opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
His character was originally based on Atkinson, a mysterious traveller and international man whose story was aired in a Barclaycard television commercial, leaving a mess after he woke up from his sleep.
There was a good time or two on this most recent JE tour.
I like the part where Johnny English approaches the stage in a medieval silk dress and has a light-hearted, soft-sounding fruit fly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for dark comedy is evident, but his one-liners make him feel like a rival, unhelpful, strange, and unsuitable, especially as a major character in films like 2007 and the much-lauded Mission Impossible.
The comedy makes it feel like it's more focused on children than adults, and to me, Jenny Inglis's combination of crazy danger is not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent comedy in the character Bean's dialogue.
A recurring theme of discussion at the moment is that the UK is already in serious trouble.
A computer hacking thief breaks into the UK's top-secret buying websites, revealing the identities of all the UK's secret agents in the sector, causing a general strike - a pitifully minor role for Kevin Eldon to take on.
It was the last chance for a struggling prime minister to prepare to fight and suffer a major loss of political popularity: Emma Thompson had done her best and with a staff almost as good as Theresa May's, but could not handle it anyway.
Her intelligence advisers told her that because of the decline in active purchases, she would have to take a pensioner and return to work.
And that means Johnny English, who speaks English himself, who is now hired to be a tutor in a high school but gives informal lessons in how to be an undercover agent: There are some great comics here in English that offer a business class similar to the School of Rock comics.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his long-suffering ex-con, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a married man, is assigned to the Navy's commander, a thrilling acting role in which actress Vicki Pepperdine plays a rather unlikely character.
So Batman and Robin of the making of things go wrong at the service of the Lord of the Rings are back in action, facing off against Olga Kurylenko's deadly Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of being under the spell of a sympathetic tech mogul who claims to have solved Britain's computer crisis: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their hilarious adventure: posing as table runners, they burn down a French luxury restaurant, create a disfigurement, and race themselves onto Volta's racing yacht. English tries to create an autonomy when he tries to use a virtual reality-generated earphone to get to know Volta's interior.
All stops and points are set for the last release, but while it is friendly and atmospheric, it is a children's TV show.
It's a good medium.
And as with other Johnny English films, I still wondered if the British film industry couldn't put Rowan Atkinson on stage with the talent he deserved.
The Labour Party denies that it is not going to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week but is charged wages for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a big, fast-track plan that would give Britons a four-day work week - but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company to continue to pass on the savings generated through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to retired workers by giving them extra days off.
It's good to see employees enjoying a three-day weekend, but they can still get the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea may be in line with the party's economic stance and there are plans to make the country more supportive of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported a shift to a four-day workweek as a way for wage earners to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desirable goal that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy, allowing for wage workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
This objective is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
However, a Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and the party has not considered that objective".
Former opposition leader John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to add detail to his vision for an economic socialist revolution.
McDaniel said he was committed to taking back power from the faceless director and the profit-seeking spies at the public utility.
The former opposition minister's plan also means that current shareholders in state-owned companies in Guyana may not be able to get their entire stake back because the Labour government could make a cut based on disloyalty.
The former Bishop also confirmed plans to put retired workers on company boards and set up a private ownership fund to give 10% of private sector assets to employees who are likely to steal a yearly dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the television show 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on the Weather Channel on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I want to be sure".
I said I was going to go into the courtroom, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the charges came out, and said, "What if you did it?"
He was strong-willed, determined, and without any doubts.
However, Graham's casting seems to be difficult to change.
He said, "My decision has already been made on Brett Gavanaugh, and it will take a lawsuit that could explode".
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone she mentioned by name couldn't match it.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert series featuring a large number of exciting, exciting, and equally exciting stars performing and mission-driven to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, rapper Cardi B and singer Shawn Mendes, but also to further promote the event's real-world goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international humanitarian advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of activists actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a task or series of activities, such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or any other meaningful means to help advance their goals of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a really good way to persuade people to take action by calling for action or is it just another case of so-called "social media activism" - do people feel like they're making a real difference by signing up online or tweeting on social media?
Since 2011, Global Citizens says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which push for even more different targets.
They say these actions have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than US$37 billion that are set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group made 390 pledges and declarations stemming from its activities, at least $10 billion of which was re-opened or frozen.
The group estimated that the funds, which were deemed safe, had a positive impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledge commitments include the Food Donation, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging to provide Rwanda with US$35 million to help end the country's food shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a defining moment in history, Food Programme Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken, there was a call for the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, and the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition programme, which will reach 5 million mothers and children, as well as nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the civil rights movement and the nationalist arguments before us, we will succeed because we will be more inclusive if we stand together.
The Weekend, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, are among the acts performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Noyes.
The US could use the navy to blockade the road to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary, Washington
The US Navy could, if necessary, use its own navy as a last resort to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, according to a Washington Examiner interview with US Secretary of State Ian Sinclair.
Zhengyi alleged that Russia's relevant intervention in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a ploy to mine new energy markets.
He said, "I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy centers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hemisphere of Europe".
And according to the official, there are a few ways and means to solve this problem.
He said, "The US has a navy that is capable of ensuring that the sea lanes are open and if necessary, shut them down to ensure that their energy does not enter the market".
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United Arab Emirates.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are similar in character.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group called Voice of the Energy Consumer in America.
The statement came as the Trump administration was on a mission to promote its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, a low-cost option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Armenia to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says makes clear that Berlin will become Moscow's "hairpin" if Armenia does not.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to increase the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's bold opposition to the project was for economic reasons and was a model of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy resources are not tools to put pressure on each other and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The US move prompted a strong reaction from Armenia, which reaffirmed its commitment to the same project.
Armenia's leading industrial organization, the Federation of Armenian Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the Confederation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator says Elizabeth Warren will take "the most careful consideration" in her 2020 presidential bid
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider very carefully" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and heal a government that's broken, including a woman in the top job".
After November 6, I will consider very carefully running for president.
Warren challenged President Donald Trump during a town hall rally, saying that Trump was leading the country in the wrong direction.
She said, "I am deeply concerned about the impact that Donald Trump is having on our democracy".
Warren has been highly critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Ms. Warren's supporters think she should not run for president in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center, or Boston University Poll, sixty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for president.
Eighty-two percent supported a woman's presidential run.
The poll showed a large support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his race and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic candidates who have been brought into the debate regarding the potential of the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January.
Sarah Palin quotes her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a rally of Donald Trump supporters
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
She told Trump supporters at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, "What my son is going through, what they will have to go through back home, I can understand the feelings of other families with PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers have when they return".
Palin considered his arrest "a big issue not brought up", and she also spoke of her son and other veterans: "They came back different, they came back with different traits, they came back with questions about whether they had any appreciation for what their fellow soldiers, both soldiers and airmen, had done for this country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with one count of aggravated sexual assault, one count of reporting assault and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, Washington D.C. support challenging new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum claims to runaway or domestic violence victims.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and territories filed a lawsuit Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of asylum seekers who are challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case, Grace v. Justice, a complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to challenge federal policy was not released.
She said that her partner and her son, a member of a violent gang, had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys assisting Ms. Grese described how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have made multiple applications for asylum in the United States at a time when the country is facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amends a 2014 decision by the Immigration Security Council that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not address decades of international and constitutional law, federal law".
The representative of the petitioner to the court said that "Federal law requires that all patent claims be judged on the basis of the specific cause and nature of the claim, and such a restriction violates that principle".
The attorney further argued in brief that policies that deny immigrant entry have hurt the American economy, saying they can become entrepreneurs and a vital labor supply.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an immigration judge to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and abuse in June.
Sessions stated in a statement on June 11, "Asylum is available only to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social or political group".
Asylum does not mean alleviating all the problems, not even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search for survivors
The situation is even more dire for the survivors.
Risa Kusuma, 35, who is grieving for her son who has a fever at a refugee camp in the city of Paulo, said: "It feels very stressful".
The fire trucks were carrying bodies almost everywhere.
Clean water is scarce.
Seeing people return to their destroyed homes to pick up the leftovers and try to collect what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered neck and shoulder injuries, rested outside the Palau's Army Hospital and patients were treated outside due to the tremors.
Tears were streaming down his face as he recalled the devastating earthquake that hit the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There is no time to save yourself.
And I went into the broken wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for their wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was gone.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe.
US Embassy accuses China of "threatening" with "extremist propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page daily US media ad boasting of the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US Embassy in China accused Beijing of using US media to promote propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a report about the addition of Chinese daily China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after it accused China of trying to interfere in November's six U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that the Beijing government is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments have placed ads to promote trade, it is common for Beijing and Washington to be caught up in an escalating trade war that has forced the two countries to impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say China's retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade war were intended to target exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and citizens.
The ambassador to China, Branstad, wrote in an article in the Des Moines Daily News on Sunday that China is now increasing the dual threat of corruption and propaganda through our free press.
Ambassador Bernstad wrote that "in promoting its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's free traditions of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register".
He wrote, "On the contrary, if you look at the newspaper on the streets of Beijing, you will find the least amount of dissent and not a true reflection of the different views that Chinese people have about the economic nature of China's current problems because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had offered not to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are trying to alienate women voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh crisis.
As senior Republicans prepare to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces sexual assault charges, analysts warn they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the run-up to the upcoming midterm elections.
There is a lot of interest around this issue, and most Republicans are showing they want an early election.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday that things cannot go backwards.
Reeher said that the appeal by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation was not enough to anger voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for MoveOn, said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow and in November".
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber, Mic reported, as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told news websites that "the boldness and the pro-democracy will be inevitably shut down".
Some people say it's happened, it's true.
And it's already set that way, especially for urban voters and young voters ages 18 to 29. If they don't like the president, they don't vote at all.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash would likely ensue if Republicans pushed for further confirmation.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week: "This has become a huge concern for the Republican Party".
Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats choose, told the media that "it's not just about the election of the commissioner or the last election or whether Kavanaugh was appointed to the Supreme Court, it's about how the public should address this issue and how they should treat her".
However, the American public seems to be torn between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, who is more likely to be trusted.
A new poll by the marketing research firm YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents either strongly or doubtfully believed Ms. Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they strongly or doubtfully believed Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Mr. Kwanaff lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ms. Houd.
According to a report by The Guardian, after lobbying from Congressman Flake, the FBI recently launched an investigation into allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kwanaff had drunk and raped her when she was 17.
Ms. Remarquez alleged that a candidate running for the Supreme Court position showed her his sexuality when they attended a party while they were students at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that develops Solid software based on the open source technology of Berners-Lee.
Solid software allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information users are allowed to access.
In a separate interview with Fast, Berners-Lee said in a humorous way that the intention behind the creation of the Internet was "world domination".
He said of the new company, "We have to do it now".
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online database or POD.
It can contain address lists, contact lists, job lists, calendars, libraries, music and personal and other equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are in the same browser at the same time.
The great thing about the online personal data store itself is that it is entirely user-centric, which means that it can access any kind of information.
The company called it  data-driven empowerment.
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the necessary resources and expertise to help make Solid software available to everyone.
The company is currently owned by Berners-Lee Bruce, and the security technology is being acquired from IBM, some developers are contracted to work on the project, and the Association of Code Writers is a volunteer organization.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own virtual apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to completely change their business models.
We don't ask their permission.
In a press release published by Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial empowerment and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid software.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become a powerful voice in the debate over autonomy.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Association, director of the Web Foundation, and director of the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: "I am very optimistic about the future of the web".
Bernard Vann: The Victoria Cross from the First World War is celebrated
The former Church of England bishop, who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, is commemorated in his hometown for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the raids on the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt prisons.
But tragically, four days later, he was shot dead, unaware that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two sons in a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a stone of "great symbolism" that was displayed only once every 100 years since his grandfather won the prize.
According to the Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his small regiment through the de Saint-Quentin trenches, walking through the steam and raw smoke emanating from the artillery battlefield.
He then rushed to the firing line and with great courage led the attackers forward slowly, holding the gun and defeating three other units.
Sergeant Van was shot by German snipers on 4 October 1918, more than a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's behavior, being a prince, was not so good, it was full of self-deprecation.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, was completed.
Michael Van continued that he felt very honoured to be part of the march, adding that "the courage of the real hero is being shown with the support of many people".
MMA fans were on the lookout for the brutal Bellator 206 match, but it was like watching Peppa Pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 2006, but in the end they didn't let you watch the events of Halo.
The San Jose Letter featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was also broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete, UK viewers were surprised to see the Peppa Pig cartoon alternate between them.
Some were stunned after they starved themselves into the morning to watch the game.
A Twitter fan described the post as "the most painful comedy ever".
Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said: "It's a government directive that at 6am, the content of the show is inappropriate, so they have to switch to children's shows".
"Peppa Pig" is on.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work on their timetables so that UK viewers could watch future shows together.
Coker said, "I think when I think about re-injecting, I think we might be able to do it".
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we can't do this work until Sunday, our time, and then Monday, their time.
But we're working on a solution.
Believe me, when it changed positions, there was a downward spiral and it looked unlikely.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical problem.
But it's not. It's a problem with the government.
I promise you that in the future, it will not happen again.
We're going to have five games as usual, except for six more games, which we've done for our fans, but never before.
It shouldn't have happened.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels he is the weakest in the world when it comes to sex.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he feels thinner than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it is this weakness that makes him successful.
The 24-year-old said he never knew this until he was in high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on Desert Island Discs Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host was Kirsty Young, who took a month off to recover.
Appearing as the first guest on her show, Levine, Daley said that he felt weaker than anyone when he grew up because the fact that we love both men and women is not acceptable to society.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of being weaker and the feeling that we are different is what really empowers me to succeed".
He wanted to show that he was also a "person" so that he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his gender identity.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decry homosexuality.
He said he was brought up on this because he was lucky enough to live openly about it without any repercussions, and he wanted to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said it was a surprise to fall in love with an American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Last year, Delhi married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than his brother, but he said age was not an issue.
He went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "It's hard to find someone who's my age and has had so many difficult experiences".
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "perspective" had changed completely.
He continued, "If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'What if I won the gold medal, I don't care?'"
You know, there's something bigger and more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal now is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and what his father asked him last time was, "Do we have tickets to the London Olympics in 2012?"
He said, "I dare you to tell him that you can't be next to me and sit in the front seat".
He continued, "I was holding his hand and he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and he died, I finally realized he couldn't live as long as I thought he could when I was a kid".
The following year, Delhi also participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
He continued, "I just realized this is what I've always dreamed of my whole life - to be baptized in front of fans at the Olympics, nothing makes me feel better".
At this point, it also helped to promote his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which talks about the process of trying to compete until he entered the Olympics and says he still feels very proud.
BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 UK time.
Mickelson, who was playing poorly, was moved out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record on Sunday when he will turn in the 47th Ryder Cup goal-kicking game, but he will have to change his play to make that stage go without a delay.
Michaelson, who played in the double-elimination tournament for the 12th time, was replaced by team president Jim Furyk for the two-match foreball and two-match foregoing game on Saturday.
Instead of playing as actively as he had in the past for the United States, the five-time major champion divided his time between being a linebacker and his assistant, hoping to correct what he had done wrong.
The 48-year-old, who is a right-handed batsman and a professional golfer, has never played a round of golf before, even at Le Golf National course, but he is now having a hard time with his regular misses.
And the on-field game didn't worry him much, but Michael Sen, in the ninth round on Sunday, will face British Open heavyweight champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down four points from a 12-game losing streak, start playing hot, Michaelson's game could be a very important one.
Fury expressed confidence in his players, but he didn't say much.
Furyk went on to say, "He understood his role in the present, he reached over my shoulder and put his hand on me and he said he was ready for tomorrow".
He was very confident.
He's a top player and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
But I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I thought more about that, but this is what we need to do, in this way.
He always wanted to go to the games like everyone else.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup goals on Sunday.
It may have marked the end of a Ryder Cup golfer's career that did not match his own record.
Michaelson won 18, lost 29 and drew seven, but Frick said Michaelson's presence brought a lot of success to the team.
He explained: "Mr. Michaelson was funny, he spoke the language, he played the words, he made people laugh, he was a good guy in the group".
I think your players are having fun with him this week, which I'm happy to see.
He contributed a lot not only for the game of golf.
European Commission President Thomas Bjorn knows that big fortunes can be lost.
Thomas Bion, the European team president, knew from experience that a remarkable lead to the final individual match in the Ryder Cup could be a tough race.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 tournament at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, but they were defeated in the final round by 141⁄2-131⁄2 points.
"You have to remind yourself that we had a big lead at the Waldrama, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, but we lost again, and at the Waldrama, where we had won, but that was it", said Bion, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on both days, Friday and Saturday, to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So if history shows me and us to that group, it's not over.
You will have to work hard tomorrow.
Enter the competition and play your best.
It's not over until you score on the green scoreboard.
We have one goal, and that goal is to try to win this, and that's what we have to focus on.
I've said so far, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side, and they have the strongest players in the world.
With his players playing well on the goalfield, Bayonne added: "I'm not going to say no to this.
Tomorrow is a big game.
Tomorrow is an individual game that has to be played differently.
It's great that we can be there with our teammates when we're at our best, but when we're out there alone, our ability to score is tested to the limit.
That's the message that players need to get: to try to play your best tomorrow.
Now we leave our partner to his own devices and he has to play his best game.
In contrast to Brian, Jim Ferrick tried to make his players play better individually (alone) than they did as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and the elder Justin Thomas, who scored three points in the fourth quarter.
Fricke himself was up and down the game in the final moments, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ultimately losing to the European team because of a huge success in Medina.
He said in response to a question about whether Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team president, had gathered his players to play until the final day: "I remember every word of the game".
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start winning slowly, like we saw in Brooklyn, in Medina today.
When such momentum is taking place, it will put a lot of pressure on the mid-round match.
We also designed our lineup to match that, and we positioned them in ways that we thought were the best and greatest for tomorrow's game.
Thomas was tasked with trying to fight back and faced Rory McIlroy in the final with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European teams in the semi-finals.
Bayon with his personal game selection, saying, "I played with this team in this order because I thought I could play it all.
The new German cruise ship has been delayed again.
One media outlet reported that the Armenian Navy's newest cruiser was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older ships from the Cold War era, but it would not be commissioned until next year due to systemic problems and overspending.
According to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been delayed until mid-2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy as early as 2014, but later transportation problems hampered the fate of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that the ship will be equipped with a large gun, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as radar interception, radio waves and low-level noise.
Other features include long-term maintenance - the latest cruise ship can be kept at sea for up to two years.
Die Zeit further reported that, however, the continued delays meant that the latest cruise ship, which was said to have allowed Germany to develop offshore energy projects, would have become obsolete by the time it was put into service.
The F125 drone made headlines last year when the Armenian Navy officially refused to commission it and handed it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a cruise ship to a builder after delivery.
The exact reasons behind the return of the submarine are unknown, but the Armenian media have highlighted some serious problems with software and hardware bugs that rendered the submarine useless if used for combat missions.
The problem of soft defects was particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg was operating with a need for about 120 officers, almost half the size of the old Baden-class submarine.
The ship was also too heavy, which reduced its operational capabilities and the Navy's ability to add to future operations.
It is believed that the 70,000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz was twice as heavy as the similar ship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to hardware issues, the cost of the entire project - including crisis training - is also becoming an issue.
It is said that the cruise ship is worth up to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The issue of the latest cruise ship is particularly important given recent warnings that the Armenian fleet is in decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was indeed "lacking in high-performance ships".
The official said the problem was widespread as older vessels were being decommissioned but there were no replacement ships.
He expressed his regret that the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships could not join the fleet.
The National Trust knows about the secret life of bats.
A new study, conducted at a castle in the Scottish Highlands, aims to show how bats use the field to catch their food.
They hope that this finding will open up new insights into the behaviour of these bird conservationists and help pave the way for future conservation efforts.
A study by a team of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor common pipistrelles and soprano pipistrels, as well as Daubenton and black-eared pipistrels at Inverewe Park in the Western Ross region.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the castle to monitor the bats' activities throughout the season.
National Health Service (NHS) staff and volunteers will also conduct a telephone survey using a handheld tracker.
The sound analysis of all the professional recorders will determine the frequency of the mouse calls and what kind of animal is doing.
Refuge maps and reports will be produced to create a detailed general landscape-level picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as creating wetlands and the best ways to preserve forests for bats and related species.
The number of greens in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically in the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development projects that are breaking down and affecting their habitat loss.
Wind turbines and blasting (high-altitude blasts in public places) can also cause hazards such as rusting, chemical treatment of certain building materials, and even being attacked by animals.
The fact is, bats are not blind.
But because of their habit of catching at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify the dangers and obstacles of its flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 acres of reserves across the country, pays great attention to bats.
The organization has trained ten experts who survey the beds of bats and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation also established Scotland's first all-bat sanctuary at Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, home to Scotland's ten species of bat.
The park's manager, David Thompson, says the area is the best territory for bats.
He said, "Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for bats.
We have many old castles, many trees and even better shelters.
But there's a lot more about bats that we don't yet know, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what bats need to survive as much as possible.
He stressed the importance of bat screening before repairing old buildings, because a single accidental damage can kill up to 400 bats and their offspring, which could wipe out the entire country.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland director of the Wildlife Trust, encouraged the public to join in the support.
She said: "We need to learn more about our bats, we don't know how many of our bats are running away".
Ronaldo denied the sexual assault allegations and had his lawyer write a letter to the German newspaper.
Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed allegations of sexual abuse against him as "fake news", claiming that people "want to make themselves famous".
His lawyer is preparing a complaint against Der Spiegel, which published the case.
The Juventus Portuguese international was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo was alleged to have given her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking in an Instagram Live to his 142 million followers after the claim was reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news".
No, not at all.
What they said today is fake news: The five-time Ballon d'Or winner says so in the video.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They're famous for saying my name, but it's part of their job.
The player added, "I am a lucky person".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against the newspaper Der Spiegel over allegations that his team of lawyers "misreported the allegations about their privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek compensation for "moral damage in scale in response to the serious human rights violations that may have been one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to Ronaldo's room, where he allegedly raped her in secret, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayrunga claimed that Ronaldo knelt to apologize to her after the incident and told her that he was 99% a good man, only 1% were bad enough to do this.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the two had sex, but it was done with their mutual consent.
Mayuruga also claimed that she had gone to the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the dispute out of court because she feared reprisals and she was worried about public embarrassment.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to recover as she continues to suffer from the pain of the incident.
Ronaldo joined Real Madrid after leaving Manchester United during the scandal, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will forever mourn the inevitable loss of its car manufacturers
UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would forever mourn its loss of its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was unfortunate that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Tsak.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delays in the absence of a deal could be a huge job cost.
The Bernasston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the EU.
Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnhamston, said: "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop making cars in our factories".
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on what will happen to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concern is related to what the automakers say is the risk of supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production lines operate on a  on-time basis, bringing in parts of the car every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the cars they order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause border disruption that industry insiders say could lead to delays and car parts shortages.
The company has stated that it will be impossible for Toyota to hold a conference for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant and therefore its production will be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was clearly outlined to avoid such checks at the border.
"We need to have a deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We want the best deal that will allow us to not only succeed in the present but also to seize the opportunity".
The evidence, not just from Toyota alone, but from other car manufacturers, that we have to be able to continue what's a successful supply chain.
Toyota said that production would stop at some point, but in the long run, the company warned that the additional costs would weaken the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses due to high costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is also the union coordinator at the plant, said his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs are gone, they will not come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for future relations with the European Union".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that a meeting between Donald Trump and Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week as disputes over the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continue.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump-Russia relations and obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will step down as attorney general, which could affect his independence, has been a hotly debated topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed, on audio recording, a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president from office under Article 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, where there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would decide not to remove Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate committee hearing in which Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct by a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom had already testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate primary.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for that has not been set yet, it could be this week, I see it could be another week, because there is something else going on at the Supreme Court".
But we're watching, and I'm always reporting to the media.
Some news sources will dispute this claim: Ms. Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that the lack of press conference coverage was not due to dissatisfaction with some television reporters who "asked too late", but she said, "I won't deny the fact that they did speak too late".
She also said that direct contact between Trump and the media would inevitably grow.
She stated that the President has answered more questions than any previous president. She said this without any evidence and that we have kept the number of questions.
Ms. Sanders stated that press conferences would continue, but "if the press had the opportunity to interview the President of the United States directly, it would be better than talking to me".
We've tried to do this a lot, and you've seen that we've done a lot of it in the last few weeks, and there will be a press conference in the near future where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump has always accepted questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Press conferences with only one media outlet are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have revealed the reason for the surprise and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a large media audience.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff at NHS Scotland over fears of a potential outbreak.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wishes them continued after the next round.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a bill that in less than six months, the UK will be leaving the European Union.
The Scottish Government is already committed to making the cost of applying for residency affordable for EU citizens working in its public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the UK's departure progressed towards a conclusion as expected in the coming spring.
But the UK government is already stepping up its preparedness for the scenario of its no-deal departure, which could happen.
I know that at this time of need you are all very ill and hard to bear.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contributions of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Volunteers from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances healthcare delivery and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is like your home and we want you to stay here.
American cricketer Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee Press reporter Mike Organ reported that defensive end Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
Reed said, "He came to the corner line and fell right there".
Several coaches and medical staff put oxygen on the cricketer at the side of the line before putting him on a stretcher and bringing him back for further examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had already undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Second-year quarterback Abercrombie, who is entering his first season with Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five saves on Saturday before leaving the game, leading the season with 18 saves.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxation fees when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to high property tax when they buy property in the UK, with additional fees for use to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
Such policies would balance the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters.
This tax increase will then be applied to those who have not paid tax in the UK.
The bank expects it will raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers are set to pay such a high tax when they buy UK property, with extra money to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success of Jeremy Corbyn's lobbying efforts to attract younger voters with the promise of affordable housing, which the tax targets those with higher incomes.
The tax increase would then be made to individuals and companies who do not pay UK tax with extra money to encourage the government to fight homelessness.
The additional payment is in addition to the current tax on the cost of care services, including a high-level tax imposed two years ago, a tax on second homes and homes purchased for rent, and for these taxes it can be up to three percent.
The bank expects the change to boost the budget by up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's built-up properties are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up their prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get in.
There are areas where many of the country's richest resources, especially in the capital, have become "black cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, who spend almost all of their time living abroad.
The new policy was created just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the cost of subscription services to help young people get their first homes.
He accused major construction companies of increasing property prices by restricting land but not using it, and he urged May to drop the house tax to make it affordable to address the UK's housing problems.
Kerwin announced a proposed housing reform that included managing rent and ending evictions of innocent tenants from their apartments.
He also wants to give more power to the council to build more new housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would resign as Prime Minister to restore the British dream that a new generation should have a better life.
And that means solving this problem of a concentrated housing market.
The UK has always been open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But this is not correct, as it is too easy for non-UK residents and foreign-based companies to buy a home in the UK, while UK residents have a hard time buying a home back.
For many people, their dream of owning their own home is far from being realized, and for them, finding a suitable place to sleep is an ever-present reality.
JR: My biggest ambition is to run Scotland.
Jack Ross, chairman of Sunderland Football Club, said his "biggest dream" was to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish manager is delighted to be helping the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, to three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I want to play for my country as a good player.
Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland, "I got a B helmet, that's all there is to it".
But I remember watching the Scottish team play at Hampden Stadium so many times with my father when I was a kid, and it always reminded me of the team.
That opportunity will come if I manage the club successfully.
The previous Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of the big and famous club, having previously been turned down by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be determined by 'Can I lead this club back to the Premier League?'
He said that due to the structure and facilities at the club, it will enter the Premier League without any doubt.
It wasn't easy to get there, but I had to imagine myself succeeding, leading the club there.
Ross has been in the manager's job for three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Heart.
He then helped Al Ahly to rebound from relegation to the Third Division and moved St Mirren from relegation to the Championship the following season.
And Mr. Roth said he felt better than when he worked at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled the responsibility of managing the club, saying: "It may be on a real breakthrough".
I firmly believe that management is a job that is more relevant and appropriate to me than playing.
It was amazing because I was a good player, I had a good life, and I enjoyed the good sex.
But getting into the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of work you have to do every week.
I still do the same job, the stress and pressure of the job, but management feels like the right job for me.
I've always wanted to be in control, and now I'm doing this job, and I feel the greatest satisfaction that I've loved, the satisfaction that I've had almost my entire life.
You can listen to the entire interview on Sportssound on Sunday, 30 September at Scottish Radio between 12 and 13 PM Scottish time.
The survey found that the ideal time to drink a pint of beer was at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The spring heatwave boosted the UK wine auction revenue, but it also put even more pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures showed that the sales figures for bars and wine bars rose by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's financial adviser, said: "The continued hot sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup means July will follow a similar pattern to June, when wine shops rose 2.8% and restaurants fell sharply".
The 1.8 percent drop in hotel sales in June was even more severe in July.
The number of bars and wine bars selling wine and beverages, which are more popular than restaurants, also fell.
The wine sold in the food stalls is not sold well because of the intense sunlight, but in the restaurants it is even more slow.
Look, it looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Across stores, wine bars and wine sales were up 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales were down 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM's Rise and Development Research Group, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when we talk about sales in outdoor markets or stores.
It's no surprise that the restaurant industry continues to struggle, even as sales drop 4.8 percent year over year, which is especially painful given the additional pressure on spending that tends to persist.
The long, unfortunate spring is becoming increasingly difficult for food retailers, with only time to determine if the temperature appropriate for August will improve their sales situation.
Total sales growth at stores and restaurants, including newly opened stores, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new casino or brand opening.
The restaurant sales tracker Coffer Peach Tracker tracks sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub industry, working on collecting and analysing sales data from 47 executive agencies with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and was set up as an industry-wide survey.
One in five kids have a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
One survey found that one in five children as young as 11 had a secret social media account that they kept from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rise of fake Instagram.
This news has raised fears that pornographic content (pictures or videos) is being posted on these websites.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a master account to show their parents.
One in five children as young as 11 years old are creating social media accounts that they keep secret and hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Insta accounts, which are applications used to link to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content (pictures or videos) is being posted on these websites.
Twenty percent of students said they used the correct "master" account to show off to their parents, and they also had another private account.
A mother accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's private network and posted a video of a teenager forcing others to "rape me".
Research by UK-based Digital Awareness and the Independent Schools Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two accounts, and half of those children admitted to keeping their private accounts anonymous.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is a difficult and headache that so many teenagers have created online distribution platforms that their parents and teachers cannot know and find these platforms".
Eilidh Doyle will be a supportive voice for athletes at the Scottish Athletics board.
Eldred Dale was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Diane is Scotland's most accomplished track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie considered the election a great opportunity for practitioners to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last 10 years.
Beatty said: "Ellie is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and the global labour community, and we are confident that labour in Scotland will greatly benefit from having her on the board".
Ms. Dale said: "I want to be a voice of support for our athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help lead sport in Scotland".
The American athlete, who won the bronze medal in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta with a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC pundit, has been paralyzed after suffering a severe stroke.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I suffered a stroke.
I was born hungry.
The doctor said, "Only time will tell how well I will recover".
This job was very hard, but it was possible for me to recover, I learned to walk again, and today I do a lot of fast movement!
Thank you for sending me your inspirational messages!
The commercials of breast milk and the similarity of women as mothers to cows have caused a lot of controversy on the Internet.
A company that makes formula from cow's milk has caused a lot of controversy online with an ad comparing a mother who breastfeeds her baby to a cow.
To launch the world's first wearable breast milk booster, Elvie Electronics released a commercial video that demonstrated the convenience of the new device for mothers who are breastfeeding their babies.
Four mothers danced in a cowshed full of milk, dancing to the tune of the song: "Wow, I'm breastfeeding like this, but I don't have a milkshake", and "Please note, this is not milk, this is me".
"Bring her out, bring her out, bring her out! Let me suckle the baby! Bring her out, let me suckle the baby!"
But the advert, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With a total of 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it showed the "terrible" nature of the dairy industry.
 Don't think too hard, take the cow to advertise the product.
One theory is that they were like us, that they were pregnant and giving birth to milk, but their newborn was taken away from them before they were born.
Elvie's bottle of milk is worn only once (Elvie or Mother).
Another commented: "Woe to the mother and the child.
But why not use it to promote breastfeeding for mothers who are breastfeeding their babies?
Others have argued: "I never thought of advertising like this".
Others supported the advert, with one woman saying she liked the song, "It's so funny".
I think this kind of advertising is a great idea.
I'll buy one too, if I'm breastfeeding.
The milkshake, I feel like a pig.
Advertising is a bit of a bummer, but I can handle it.
This is a product that is not designed.
Another argued: "This is a satirical ad for mothers (mostly at work or in the bathroom) to pump milk like a cow".
This ad is not meant to praise or value the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women said they danced with a milkshake in their underwear.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that women who milk say yes, they feel like a cow in a cowshed.
However, the Elvie Pump does not have a cord or tube, it is placed in the woman's underwear at once, making it easy to move around or carry, and can be taken outside while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: "Elvie Pump is a new revolutionary product that deserves a brand start.
By connecting the relationship between the nursing mother and the dairy cow, we want everyone to understand the dairy and its challenges, and at the same time, we want to demonstrate in a way that we can easily understand and enjoy the convenience of the dairy.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milkshake has been featured in the front page of the newspaper.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the runway to showcase the model to fashion designer Marta Jakubowski, wearing the product while walking.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved into camps along the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children being detained has increased dramatically, despite the fact that monthly border crossings have not changed. One reason is that policies and policies set by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find sponsors for these children.
Traditionally, most donors are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of having problems staying in the country if they dare to claim to have children (who are also undocumented).
The issue escalated in June when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other adult family members must submit fingerprints, which data (handprints) will be sent to immigration authorities for review.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the top immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency also confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
 Nearly 80 percent of all individuals who are donors or family members of donors are living in the country illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals.
Elbens said: "That's why we are continuing to look for these individuals".
According to the shelter's staff, in order to speed up the process of helping these children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous rule.
Many people will appear via video conference rather than in person to file their legal rights claims with an immigration judge.
Those deemed not to have the right to reside will be deported.
According to asylum workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or escape.
Some public activists said that the concerns were even greater in large places, such as in Tornillo, where children are being exposed to the problem, which is being ignored because of its scale.
They added that moving children to the city as a dumping ground, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could cause double-digit emotional problems for children, which some children are already experiencing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eight-year war.
Morsi, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces that are on Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, we will have to deal with them along the way.
He told the assembly that they must withdraw the troops immediately and without any conditions.
Morsi claimed that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over and that more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue this holy war until we have driven all Syrian terrorists, terror groups and illegal foreign presence out of Syrian territory.
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unjustified fear" that drove the refugees away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned of no reconstruction assistance for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A U.S. diplomat said a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last stronghold created an opportunity to promote political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to 3 million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "definite timeline" and expressed hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda affiliated with the Nusra Front, who would be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, is hoping to organize the first meeting of a new commission made up of members of the government and opposition parties to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited  to review the provisions of the current constitution and also warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
In this positive vein, many liberal observers may be hopeful that Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandal end his presidency ahead of schedule.
In what is unarguably "the greatest presidential final!"
So far, there are no signs of the tracker being compromised.
Since 2014, the weekly best-of-the-week rate has doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly the equivalent of 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News had a peak hour audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million in four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had a high ratings audience of as many as 3.5 million on prime-time nights.
ABC's episode "Survivors Appeared" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol, Neal Baer said: "This is a fire that people are interested in because it's not what we understand".
Nell Scovell, veteran novelist and author of "Just a Funny Thing: The Movie" and the somewhat complex truth about joining the Hollywood "club" has another premise.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
Ability to play in a circle.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the storyline coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
The only decorative decoration that the most exclusive audience can possibly have.
And it's still not a citizen with a poster when you find yourself at 6 p.m. watching a panel discussion by Bob Woodward about using "biographical background" around the source for his book entitled "The Fear" by Paul Manafort, the Washington Post said, citing Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("Crude Dress with a Rhinestone") and connections to Stormy Daniels's description of Trump's, um, bioethics.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again for one person.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", said "part of what he's doing is making it feel like a reality show, that he's feeding you every night", perhaps reflecting Trump's shifting broadcast channels and daily scheduling inflexibility (a battle with the N.F.L. that praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't forget a bite or you have to leave.
When I visited Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He can't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing a Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
Fleiss told me, "I remember when we were doing all the crazy shows that day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
I thought it was a short comedy, but it made them laugh.

In addition to money, the flood problem is in the race to pick the semi-finalists.
It is not surprising that the 17th candidate of Pennsylvania is seeing a flood, responsible for the reorganization of the constituency, which is in two seats, which is in power for one seat.
Recently, the redistricting was eliminated again in the Pittsburg district of Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last April.
Lamb is running against another presidential contender, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is heavily overshadowed by the new 17th congressional district.
The map was made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that older counties were constitutionally valid in the Republican primary.
The new 17th candidate race has affected a bitter campaign of impeachment between the Democratic National Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow narrow victory in a close election in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a minor nod.
The United States had a bill of sanctions against El Salvador rather than support for China, but the confrontation was later called off.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and there was little interference from Washington.
Trump met warmly with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until all partners fired Trump's staff.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to recall U.S. diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision not to recognize the island of Taiwan".
However, the sanctions are considered against El Salvador, which received about US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions on destinations, could hurt the Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As domestic meetings evolved, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar rally last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
The diplomat said Vice President Mike Pence was due to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the administration's input on the rally.
And three American missionaries have returned from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Bolton declined to comment on any details surrounding the talks described by the three US officials, including two other diplomats who agreed to meet on anonymous terms.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book of wisdom.
Waiting until the matter is resolved may be Robert Mueller's special advice on possible obstruction of justice for Trump, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller has also reportedly turned his investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress should change its aid, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he has prepared to return to the voters once again, and perhaps eventually he would have the judge as his friend.
That and many more, I don't mean to imply that Trump's failure is inevitable, nor is his legitimacy in Europe.
There are many choices being made by both sides of the Atlantic that will influence the long-running conflict.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the Bolsheviks would resist him and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
History courses focus on reflective points and forward movements towards democracy that cannot be resolved by being accelerated or slowed.
Now Americans are facing these ups and downs.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the report reported that last year he requested a presidential poll and estimated he was unfit for his position.
Rosenstein said the Times story was incorrect.
"How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's request for a new FBI investigation is incomplete or unfair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false imprisonment?"
And more importantly, will we have a midterm vote for Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because I learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis, who had taken over my embassy.
She survived and immigrated to America 60 years later, and I said goodbye to the Sabbath we were together for.
It's my legacy. Can't I be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria after an impressive pair of caps in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month would put them in a strong position to advance to the Europa League Group G qualifiers.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he was confident that Rangers could use the result as a great game.
The 31-year-old said: "It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
"We went into this game believing we could get something and walked away with a point.
We may have lost in the final, but overall, the draw is probably the right outcome.
They probably did better in the first set, and we came out in the second set and were the better team.
Coming into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it was a tough game because they had a good performance in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, we are sure we can push forward and get positive results.
Last year was very difficult with everything that happened with my injury and the changes at my own club, but there are good things about this place now.
The team is good and the boys are really happy with it. The training is good.
In the hope that we can push forward now, it's our last season and we're successful.
Women are sleeping rough around this retirement saving fear.
Although survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of people in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance nationwide, said, "People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to do the talking".
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear beforehand.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be a factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care can include a long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy that costs a portion of your child's income to help cover these costs, or auto-insurance with your own funds - as long as you have the money.
Facilitate your legal documents: Preventing access to legal battles.
Get a healthcare professional appointment to let you appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that the professional respects your wishes in case you are unable to contact them.
Consider also your financial authorization.
You will choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your mortgage is paid if you are unable to pay.
Don't forget a little detail: Imagine that your elderly parent has a health problem and they are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Explain the experience details in the written plan so you are prepared.
"It's not just the financially unimportant, but who is the doctor?" asked Martin.

Who will take care of the dog?

A man was shot multiple times with a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a wind gun as he walked home one night.
The victim was in his 40s in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 2:30 a.m., as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police have filed a complaint for the witness.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that struck Palu, Indonesia on Friday, and the death toll is likely to rise.
Due to the disconnection of communications, rescue workers were unable to receive any information from Donggala district, located north of Palu, which was near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow channel on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a narrow strip of land that stretches along more than 300 kilometers of coastline on the tropical island of Sulawesi.
The land under this control is a county-level administrative area with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic activities of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in this province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, off the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the islands of Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific seismic fireball and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the deaths in Aceh province.
2005: A powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing tsunami waves of up to 10 metres, destroying several villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as residents were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami erupted at this time, but more than 100 people died as the towers collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Palin of Wasaga, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a woman acquaintance tried to call police to report an alleged crime, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being hospitalized ahead of the Mat-Su trial and is being held on a $500 bond, according to KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he declared himself "clearly not guilty" when questioned by his prosecutors, according to online reports.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor counts, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first criminal charge filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault and obstructing a report of domestic violence and having a weapon in his hand while involved in the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he touched her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed in tsunami disaster
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks are damaged with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the central Sulawesi, located north of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Several videos are circulating on social media with the timing of the immediate impact shown.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu as a tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York terror attacks.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attacks that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental car to carry out a bicycle lane robbery along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan that rammed pedestrians and cyclists on his street in October.
To prove the validity of the death sentence, prosecutors will have to show that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and inflicted "intentional" grievous bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both convictions could carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal judge convicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, in a criminal case involving illegal phone business, used by federal authorities in organized crime and a charge of rape and vandalism.
Prosecutors said the attack required "extensive planning and caution", describing how Saipov carried it out as "cruel, brutal and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and damage to family and friendsDiego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the note said of the nature of the attack.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York imposed the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of a drug dealer in Nagano, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
More recently, the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, and was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of sexual culture in the days and after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to display an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
Patton stated, "We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a response from a convicted prisoner in prison without the possibility of parole could prolong the pain of these events for everyone involved".
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP candidate says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "gather the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukrainian leader said politicians must feel warmed by those who are hesitant to make European integration a reality because a Theresa May MP candidate suggested he should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Labour MP Peter Bone told the Guardian in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Farage were Brexit number one.
But the many challenges she may face in uniting her deeply divided party are underscored by the Pro-Remains Tories, who are taking part in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her reconciliation plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would push ahead with trying to negotiate a deal with Brussels despite strong public backlash, forcing those who were hesitant to make European comparisons and workers to choose between her package and her "confidence".
Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "branding Chequers".
He suggested that Farage should be established as a network of friends and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, "If he has taken charge, we will leave now".
Wellingborough MP candidate added: "I will stand up for Brexit but we need to throw out Chequers".
On creating a debate against the EU, he said: "We did not fight against the world war as a contract.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected the public opinion poll that has changed since the 2016 election:  The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to continue remains untrue.
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: the Prime Minister listens to the people.
Chequers are not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists, it has really taken the road and got us to vote first.
Drop your checkers and start listening.'
In a message pointed to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told rally politicians that they needed to make the "feel hot" if they betrayed the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
He said,  Now this is a matter of mutual trust between us, the people and our political leaders.
They are trying to circumvent Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you get away with it.
In a message to a throng of people, he added: "I want our political establishment, which is linked to Brexit betrayal, to feel warm.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country to give us victory over Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the crowd walked through Birmingham before opening a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists covered banners reading Tories Against Brexit after the group's performance this weekend.
A fellow worker, Lord Adonis, mocked the bishops for the security problems they were suffering with a party programme as the conference opened.
He added, "These are the people who told us they could have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada, the borderless, the unfettered, for free trade without borders in Ireland".
It's all very funny.
He added that there is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren has a serious plan to run for president.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She became the center of speculation that she might defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with residents using a city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded, "It's time for a woman to go to Washington D.C. to fix a broken government that already includes a woman at the top".
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting of LSU baseball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on 247sports: "Wayde Sims suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and eventually died".
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at Baton Rouge Parish Regional Police Station.
A 6-foot-6 kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finished as world champion after the team ordered him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas qualified enough to lead Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team command would be a big part of the race.
From Paul Bottas, who got off to a good start and nearly beat Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two races and invited Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel entered the field first and left Hamilton to run into traffic at the tail end, which was what should have been decided.
Mercedes later ran a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a few lap-to-lap races that saw the Ferrari driver nearly stall, leaving the inside of the pack in a dangerous position after two shifts to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the red line of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first race on his 21st lap.
He then took a large part of the race as he changed his bike to quickly set course and beat Kimi Raikkonen, finishing fourth.
He eventually entered the 44th round but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen received a fourth round.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a good guy who told me.
Hamilton said the crew did such a special job to have one or two.
That is the worst kind of prophetic language.
President Donald Trump taunted Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she had not hidden secrets from Christine Blasey Ford in the Supreme Court sexual assault case against Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before a Senate committee; instead, he said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "dirty and mean and dishonest".
He said, "One thing that can happen and a good thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and mean bad and untrue".
 When you look at the release and the news and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make the news?
Wait for her answer -- did you make the news? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, not really.
I didn't make the news".
Wait a minute.
If we make the news...no, we didn't make the news", he added in the interest of the Senate.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak did not come from his office.
"I didn't hide the accusation against Dr. Ford, I didn't hide her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret when she asked".
But her denial is unlikely to sit well with the president, who made the following remarks during a meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what the worst prophetic language is.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst prophetic language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the chief justice suggested that Democrats use rumours to end the affair.
 They are committed to taking power through some means necessary.
Mediaite reported the chief justice's statement that "you see the evil, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, they don't care who they compete with for power and control".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the first team to win the league title.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars worked to clear the slate for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants, taking a 5-3 win over Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two runs in the inning, taking the first two runs in the inning on hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer bought the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored an equaliser for Dundee before player Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals for their success.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe, who followed up by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning three games last time.
Dwyer scored on the opening play at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier to the lead four minutes later.
During a thrilling opening session, Sullivan brought the home team back on the field at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the equaliser for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first inning when he scored his second touchdown on the final night of the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again brought them into the equation with a goal scored in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee their first lead in the final in the second round, and he ensured a win for his team in his fifth round in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies trying to save hundreds of people on a plane that could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggered by a tsunami.
Severe earthquakes continue to occur in the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the powerful control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He reserved the space to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 could fly safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died in hospital.
Australian ABC News reported that Indonesian Airlines spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives.
We arranged a convoy from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning before the expedition reached Palu.
He added: "Our hearts are heavy to hear this".
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, with the country's disaster response agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns is limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency, said: "The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies remain under burial mounds while many people are unable to be contacted".
A wave that reached six meters devastated Palu, which will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brought in a lot of bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help the victims, but we don't know what they will find there".
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is now missing after plane crashes in a saltwater lake near the coast
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a saltwater lagoon off the Pacific coast of Micronesia now says a man is missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday evening it could not count the male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat rescued the passengers and other crew after the plane sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that 7 people were hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all were in critical condition.
What caused the crash and the subsequent course of events is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a saltwater lagoon near the coast in a short runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed low.
Jaynes said, "That's a very good thing.
Jaynes said he and others walked through deep water at the fire escape on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant was scared, screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working nearby to improve the ship's position and they also rescued by using a wind tunnel to bring people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed that 111 people died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but not involving Air Niugini.
Analysts have been spotting the timing of women being burned alive at night.
Prosecutors concluded their trial on Saturday on the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the Intelligence Analysis Division.
He told the jury how he used phone records to break up along with the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
The Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received location data from multiple phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed his phone was with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford when police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford made a statement on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another irony is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records showed that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He forgot her out of his life.
The defense of the last defendant is scheduled to begin its deposition on Sunday.
The judge also said he expected the accused to be taken to court that day.
The Bible says: "The one who has a good conscience is wise, and the one who has a bad conscience is a liar".
The three-piece hip hop group challenges stereotypes about sexuality by filling their songs with a variety of positive messages.
Hybrid from the Bristol area claimed that the hip hop music scene had moved away from the roots of politics and social issues.
They wanted to go back to their roots and make hip hop music focused on conscience popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York mayor sues a couple for firing her after receiving "racist" messages
A New York midwife is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a false reference from her mother who complained she was "just another black person".
The couple denies that they are racist, as a protest against the coup.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a single mother of two, expressed regret when she discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message, "No, another black man".
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
According to The New York Post, after learning of her abuse as "uncomfortable", Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, stating that their injured African-American midwife had done a poor job and she expected a Filipino to replace her.
Maurice Mark was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Ms. Maurice has sued the couple to recover from their dismissal and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months for the work she was originally hired to do despite no contract.
She told the Post on Friday: "I want to show them, look, you don't do that kind of thing", he added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple attacked the allegations that they were racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do, fearing they would not trust her after upsetting her.
"My wife texted her that she didn't want to say that.
She's not racist.
We are not racist", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were cheated on even if it was wrong?
What about your newborn?
Hurry up".
In what appears to be a complaint about the "attempted" murder, Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a two-month-old baby and he had a baby and was in a "very difficult" condition.
"Would you put up with someone like this?
That's not a good thing to do", the business's financial adviser added.
As the case was ongoing, the Court of Public Opinion quickly issued a statement condemning a couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and reasonableness.
A new letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington fears non-fiction readers about talking about the tiger.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes by first reading it before it was published.
It is very interesting to know now what we know about Paddington's great achievements.
Saying that her father had worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write a children's book by a small bear would be optimistic about his work being rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "deeply touching" following his death last year.
As Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of our family", she adds that her father was quietly proud of his latest achievement.
She said, "He was quiet and he wasn't arrogant".
But because Paddington was real to him, it seemed like if you had a child who accomplished something: you were proud of them even if it wasn't your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a very short way.
Although it was his invention and imagination, he often attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying, and I have to tell her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur II Hospital, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
Ednan-Laperouse said, "Nad was regularly called to say it was too bad she wasn't expected to do it".
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The pharmacist gave her to keep her heart going, the apple down, the end of the line and out of her system.
She died a while ago and this is all over.
I had to sit there and wait knowing that this was being leaked.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I have to take it seriously".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the suffering she was going through.
She said, "No one knows".
"I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a little sorry for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved her".
The painful treatment of the wound with traditional medicine to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys placed traditional cards on the bridge with messages of encouragement and phone numbers where people could call for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel today".
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a good cook with a love for cooking.
"Everyone knew him by his appearance.
They always say his gentle touch lights up a room".
However, he lost his job before he died because he was in the darkest place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the discoverer of his relative after he took his own life.
"I'm still worried that something will inevitably affect", Davis said.
Davis created the card "to let people know there's someone there so you can go and you can talk to them even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk".
Humphreys, a friend of Davies' for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
She said, "He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed or anything.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the lowest look on Christmas Day when the kids opened their cards, he didn't look at them or anything".
She said his death was a big shock to them, but they had to work through those issues: "It left a hole through the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is put on hold as the FBI begins its own investigation
Flake said on Saturday, "I think if we can really get something like what he's asking for, a limited-term investigation with a limited scope, we might be able to bring a little bit of consistency". He also expressed concern that the committee was "breaking down" when there was a stalemate over irreversible partisan tensions.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if the Republicans do poorly, they will be severely weakened in their bid to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush received a phone call to urge Senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be an election in the 51-Republican and 49-Democratic Senate currently sitting.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Mike Pence to be vice president and to end the relationship and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen under Kim.
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, saying 1,127 defectors were recorded last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said border control between North Korea and China and high regard for human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
Most of the defectors from North Korea were granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North Korea and North Korea - still on the brink of war - have grown significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on negotiating a nuclear ceasefire.
This comes after a historic meeting last June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed on comprehensive terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, "Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such a situation there is no way we will withdraw independently first".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh after suffering a stroke, saying he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a neuroscientist" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday, "I can't help but think that if a woman ever did that, they would say 'myocardial infarction.'"
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his speech, Kavanaugh was in a very emotional mood as he cried and sobbed while discussing his family and high school years.
He also denounced the committee's conservative Democrats, calling for prosecutions against the figure as a "crazy political assassination and sabotage" staged by liberals who angered Hillary Clinton who lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was anti-Democratic.
"I think he was not qualified enough with those statements and how he followed Clinton and the Democratic Party", she said.
Pelosi was controversial when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
Pelosi said, "I'm going to say this, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he doesn't deserve to not only be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which she considered a conservative court case.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's decision.
Pelosi said, "It's not the time for angry and angry people to go to court and expect us to say it's not great".
And women need to own it.
It was a harsh criticism of a quality, months and years of raging anger, and she couldn't get it out without tears.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry".
"I don't think it was weird, did it?"
She continued, "I was saved amazingly by a woman who was a local executive who said she cried when she was angry, but also invented a technique that means when she was angry and started to talk to someone, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying and look.
I was angry".
And then she just kept going.
And I think that's great".
Tears are allowed as a space for anger in part because, in principle, it is misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories from my first job as a manager in an office, I once saw myself crying with unspeakable rage, being rubbed in the eye by an older woman who was the best manager I could ever have, always a little scared - who pulled me into the stairs.
She told me, "Don't let them see you cry".
They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they understand you.
Then Democratic Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested in an unmarried affair on a ship in what was called a deception act and was suspended from the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed, thinking there was no reason she should not pursue the idea of running for president on her own.
Thirty years later, she smiled at me and said, "That's not a good decision.
"There are already seven candidates in this race, and the last thing they need is another candidate.
They called it "White Star and the Seven Deadly Sins".
Because of her delay in the campaign, she was behind the fundraising and so she vowed she would not compete until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her fans who had given $1,000 to the men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she made the speech announcing that she would not officially start a campaign, she was really trying to win over emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism she had expressed.
Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her: "You would think I was hopeless that I couldn't do anything".
"You'd think Kleenex was my business partner.
I remember thinking what they'd put on the headstone?
"Did she cry?"
How could a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
Experts say the opening of the US-China trade war is causing disruption, and that as the fighting is not over, the animosity between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump first made the warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant price increase came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (150 billion pounds) of goods, taking effect on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has been retaliating all along, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. imports.
China has vowed to retaliate with the US, and the world's second largest economic power will never forget it.
To slow Washington down means to bow to demands, but a public bow to the US would be highly embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its beer well, US trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run by reducing the two countries' dependence.
Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank, said: "Indeed, the political decisions of Washington or Beijing that could create the conditions for the start of a downturn in the two countries are more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged".
Foreign Minister says Syria is "ready" for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country after being devastated by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to work to restore the areas devastated by terrorism to their original state.
At this time, all the circumstances now point to the voluntary return of refugees to the countries they left due to terrorism and counter-terrorism measures, as isolated individuals focusing on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said Syria would welcome help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any help or conditional assistance from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States team in the final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States currently has six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup on the European continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Denmark's Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson put in a strong effort in the match, scoring a water-hit third inning on the 16th hole to give the showcase victory over Francesco Molinari.
Italian goalkeeper Molinari performed well in all of his rounds, becoming the first player to ever go 1-0-0 in the competition since the current format of the competition began in 1979.
American Georgian Spieth was dropped 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one Dustin Johnson was defeated 2-1 and England's Ian Poulter was able to play in the Ryder Cup in his final.
Spanish rider Sergio Garcia became an eight-time Ryder Cup champion and became the first European champion to score an unprecedented 25.5 points in a career.
"Normally I don't cry, but today I couldn't help it.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy I can help", Garcia said with a thrill to Europe's victory.
He crossed the line to his compatriot John Ram, who won the championship by beating Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in the championship game on Sunday.
Rahm, 23, said, "I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy".
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A rare record by one of the greatest players ever, winning 14 major championships in a short time only to be surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled throughout the weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played goalkeepers throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his team: "I am proud of these players, they fought hard".
There was this morning when we put the heat on the continent.
We gave up.
Greetings to Thomas.
He was a great team leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to re-position, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be the team leader.
You just have to raise your hands.
We play better.
Flood or Red Flood Update: Rallying decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a steady decline in the number of waterfowl in some areas of the Tampa Bay watershed.
According to the FWC, outbreaks were reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting a decline in gatherings.
The watershed extension stretches roughly 130 miles from the Pinellas Coast north to southern Lee County.
The debris was found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in a smaller area than last week.
Flooding was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or along the coast of Pinellas County were reported last week, from low to high concentrations in the coastal plain of Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manatee County, high concentrations in or along the Sarasota Basin, moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or along the Lee County Basin, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Continued respiratory infections have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory infections were reported in tropical Florida last week.
