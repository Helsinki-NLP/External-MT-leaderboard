28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Centre
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a local shopping center's roof this week.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affair ended well.”
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall shopping center on Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galician, the agency of the San Francisco death prosecutor said.
The police department in San Francisco said the death was identified as a crime and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line-up shop in Boston, had received his dream job as a line-up chef in the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said they were “terrible and shocked” because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be very missing,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and complaints to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the beginning in the hostels, but that recently “his affairs finally went well.”
“He found the apartment and met a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a great heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to make us food, make dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was a brother who walked with the stream.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an impeccable diamond that glowed more bright every day,” she said.
Anyone who has information about this is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's greenline at the number 415-575-4444.
Medical practitioners to strike: Requirements for new work fighting measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to adopt new labour combat measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee Committee (JDC) calls on the entire Council to support new labor combat measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to deal with concerns about the deal.
Medical practitioners and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with the BMA.
58% of voters rejected it.
In a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “very silent” on questions that he said led to a rejection of the deal.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement and to demand formal re-debates on all of your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request for the special case of the BMA Council to authorise the gradually advancing and expanding labor fighting program that starts early in September.
The dispute has followed that medical practitioners have participated in six strikes this year, including the first full employment in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the head of BMA’s medical practitioners, resigned after the vote had rejected the agreement, the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the voting of 54,000 physicians and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the deal will be prescribed to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: the unification of foreigners?
He who ended up in the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hide each other and to declare the eight-month struggle against words and economic sanctions has officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got a clear impression that in Ankara this reconciliation is more desirable.
At the occasion, we were covered.
But Putin’s smile seemed striking and he hardly threatened the heat, even according to his own humiliated norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, continuously spoke of his “love friend” about Putin – five times according to one report.
in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia will return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to a better level.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his intonation described the opposite.
But the cooling of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at that time was angry.
Putin accused Ankara of shooting Moscow on his back.
The breach was even worse when it came from a presumed friend.
Rebuilding true confidence will be difficult, impossible.
The opinion of the Russian general public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to a disappointing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has won a win.
The benefits of signing an Ankaras are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in the failed government coup last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is a financial motivation.
Russian economic sanctions have been severe, especially the ban on order flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 percent.
With regard to Russia, local travel organizers and airlines will surely be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They are hoping for a late season of landing in the Mediterranean.
And already this week the state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” according to a report by the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had a political added value to Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry with the Western countries for what is considered weak as a response to the attempted coup.
In addition to the long-lasting regret of the advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin is excited to take advantage of coolness and break the links of Turkey to the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to receive the point of withdrawal from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary initiative to support the designated authorities.
This is the case for Moscow, which has its own deep roots of fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the Prame Sea Palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present a “external union,” as one analyst described the situation for me: two countries that feel the Western countries have rejected them and dealt with them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to the role of a peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of speech that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish president consciously avoided to answer the question with regard to their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek a common foundation for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full catastrophe by NATO member Turkey shooting down the Russian fighter aircraft, it is better that two leaders are again even in speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank’s international goals.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save, it has abandoned these goals.
The bank’s strategists have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer funding brands.
It was supported by millions of points used to sponsore international sports, Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered to be right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the start.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the main office and stock bills are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed at a tour of customers and staff at Inverness Shir.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS’s brand becomes the employer of our investor brand and employees because we now become much more a brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
We no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s now time for us to move towards a brand bank because it’s basically (we’ve asked) how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said we intended to be a great bank to customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and gains 3,000 wins
Dettor shows the champagne after a double win, he has a total of 3,000 wins.
Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the top of the evening with his second victory on his home race while competing with the Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this row in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Three-time championship hockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, “This is special.”
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday afternoon and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs herself with hurricanes when he turns Predilection out after the victory.
Two competitors have reached this row in obstacles - championship hockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records breaking his career with more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best competitors of the present era, and it’s not surprising that he has reached this edge that only a few have reached before him.
She’s stylish and strong, but her tactical style distinguishes her from the other in the trial room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his intonation and charisma have attracted fans to the species for years.
I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have runned with 6000 winners if he wasn’t just a weekend and big games jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding with winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a living person who is a good thing for the British competition, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the flight landing from the satellite, formed from a row to a trademark.
From flight stops to flight landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race watch for two decades.
This was a mountain route.
He earned wins in big matches, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and suffered a competition ban due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had difficulty starting when he returned after a six-month competition ban, but he demonstrated significant strength in challenging the suspects and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing at least until the age of 50.
Putin expels Russian chief executive Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Chief Executive Officer Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s reliable internal circle for many years.
He is now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move away from the positions of the head of the Russian presidential administration," but there was no reason for this.
Since 2012, Ivanov’s deputy chairman, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his followers.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He later led the president’s protocol and government staff, the Kremlin’s website says (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the main task of the administration is to support your activities as a head of state as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are the smile convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, worked as the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As president, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a state television show meeting with President Putin, the two men claimed that the chief executive withdrew from his own request.
But despite the smile to the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the latter of some kind of struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate, would suddenly want to lead the Russian environmental policy, has been accepted truly doubtfully.
In his commentary on the Kremlin’s website to Putin, Ivanov said, “It’s true that early in 2012 I asked you in the discussion to give for four years to my responsibility this very complicated task, which can even be said in his work.
Well, I’ve been the chief executive for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov approved the task in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chairman.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President after a second period, since Putin's third period would have been contrary to the Constitution.
But this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was hit by a producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the series scene in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in a joint statement.
The special agent Aaron Hotchner, who played Gibson, apologized on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes.
I feel it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details about how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI agent's series are expected later.
The 54-year-old star of Dharma & Greg has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series and I’ve given it everything in the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be with it until the end, but it is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and above all the best fans that the series can have.
The 12th production season is scheduled for the 28th of September.
The mysterious fish ended in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be winds that the water bike has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published a film documentary on the appearance in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarification to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now extending to Fife
The $1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have connected the Queensferry surfaces to the northern coast and the landscape, meaning the bridge is now extending to Fife.
It is the first of the four slopes between the “People’s Threats” that are now completing around each of the three columns of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 thresholds.
The $1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economist Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensbury surfaces.
We’re witnessing all the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the land and the bridge is a demanding operation, where the extreme precise measurements must be agreed together.
In total, almost 79 percent of the bridge is now in place and the last portion of the carpet in the concrete box is thrown today in Rosyth, which means that the entire carpet is ready to be lifted on its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant staircase.
In this fantastic project, this closet represents the core of construction technology.
When the last percentage of the road was installed and connected to the expanding north column of the road, we then had to close the remaining percentage from the side of the north, i.e. to the inner land.
This was done by drawing the landscape of the northern trail 700 millimeters to the south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
It is huge because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be drawn around 3% in a curve.
Required, because the permitted measurement deviations according to which the team worked were small, just a few millimeters in both directions.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “progressed while alive”
Three men are “outsourced while alive” after they fell from their fishing vessels in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued a warning at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely on their boats as they continued to advance themselves.
“We saw the boat revolving closer to men and we imagined the worst,” said Moelfren’s rescue ship’s boatman Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, a strong wind had flooded it out of them until we got to move,” he added.
A local fishing vessel saved two men, and the third, a 60-year-old man was found exhausted in the roof of the river without a rescue sand.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “These three men who have fallen into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had a deadline, but it was somehow disappeared from the person on board when the boat collapsed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectful hunt for health and happiness
It is interesting to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching the shows.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the sofa and take part in some activity.
The time of viewing was initially limited to television, then to video games and now recently to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, we are referring to a wave called Pokémon Go. an application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (successfully created drawings, gaming cards, and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat decreased before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which is traced by GPS, and which after finding can be “photed” (with the phone’s square shot) or “picked”.
The generation, who played the game as younger, has joined the wild and jumped up on the sofa along with the searches.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily stages of the “medium person.”
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of the users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go, it’s only seeing the training level information.
The calls of many public health campaigns “find 30”, “stay out of the sofa” and “be active every day” have not produced any result because most public health warnings are boring and cared about by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Moving regularly has a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The great thing about Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, smooth air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even get new friends while hunting.
As usual, angry enthusiasts are looking for things to complain about.
Someone can walk to the door.
And then?
There was a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The news disappears and the use disappears in time.
However, because of Pokémon’s success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's fitness multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget the public.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energy of jumping.
smooth with the tree.
Unbelievable Permanent.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast achieved the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the end world to the light of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver and Final Five team leader Aly Raisman and the Russian pronsymitalist Aliya Mustafinan.
The U.S. Simone Biles balanced the women's bodybuilding multi-match in the final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has successively won the multi-match championship, and overall the fifth American champion. At the same time, she consolidated her reputation for her generation, and for all time, as the best.
He broke with tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises him to the same class with other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised his species to a new level:
Biles has dominated his race for the last three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold, with programs whose mix of ambition and accuracy has been so regrettable that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him “the best to see as a gymnast.”
The last test was awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overwhelming expectations.
Return to the family home to Texas Springs without a piece of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The U.S. Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman strike after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) for women's teline training multiplayer in the final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, August.
Biles achieved his first medal on Tuesday when he served as the top at the start party of the retirement national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future while walking a long way to the top, it’s not completely true.
Some of his permanto program — of which his brand includes the Volt drive — is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be excellent for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a grocery, and found by the coach Aimee Boorman's mother when the girl was on a study trip to the hall where Boorman was prepared, has become a power maker.
He has not lost in the multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this win-up will last as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a trick.
The balance tree and the permanto, where Biles is the dominant world champion, waited.
He climbed to the top with 15 433 trees and crossed them by getting 15 933 permannos.
Raisman welcomed him as they waited for the end points - just formality - and tears rose to Biles' glitter red, white and blue-limited eyes when the dream he once wrote in his playbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some revanche from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call “the grandmother”, was clearly in leadership.
He sent flight spots to the public after his permant performance in a sensational search for a return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as it comes to Biles, this 19-year-old’s broadly spread tweet from the past this week gets a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the deadliest attack on Phoenix's first serial killer in the last decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12.
According to the report, the shooter who stood on the passenger side of the car shot up to eight times and then flew on another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple murder was not the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not export his handbags or another adult victim for $2,900.
Phoenix police officer Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the researchers to check whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months in two mainly Latin American districts.
“This is happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including the 1990s brown Nissan, the 1990s black BMW, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers did not agree to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’ daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The spectator told the police that they were often sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triangle and the object of which was an empty open-packed car. This is believed to have also been the work of a serial killer.
The scientists discovered cracks, cracks from the seat, and cracks from the motorcycle.
6 year old mother with microkephalia: “The situation is relieving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike a large portion of his age colleagues, Edmund is a small child. This is a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I cannot do this.
I did not promise that.
What’s not true at all – I’ve promised it,” he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he was placed in hospital care.
“The first reaction was that ‘I didn’t know people are still doing it’,” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walkway.
Edmund was not sitting or riding as only at the age of three, and he is not talking yet.
But he slowly reaches some corners.
He walks assisted and runs a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund’s unreferential reference “Would you sing to me?”
“We’re teaching him a reference language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it’s not a common reference language – he tells that Edmund has invented some of his own non-reference.
Microkephalia can be caused by a number of different reasons: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as strawberry or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecast can vary considerably.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the sensory burden caused by an uncertain future.
I just asked what would happen.
What will happen?
And he actually doesn’t know yet.
I’m not actually asking for a forecast for time because I don’t expect anyone to be able to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a Zika birth rate.
The situation is relieved.
You can believe that the situation will be relieved.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Storm and floods led to rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
A severe rainfall and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare an emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their edges and caused extensive flooding due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities and that the aid is already becoming the districts in need of it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Preparation Office, said they will receive requests for elevated water carriers, boats and sand stairs.
Steele said that alone the district of Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of sandbacks.
The flood will last until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The climate service said in a statement that more rain will be expected from three to five centimeters in the region.
In southern Alabama, the flood was in force on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobilen region.
The Comite River that flows near Baton Rouge and the Amite River that flows near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a record of flooding during the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a lower threat of flooding in the Ascension district on the river, as flooding rivers slowly descend to Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, which flows south of the Mississippi State border, in Liverpool, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 p.m.
The rescuers continued to catch people from the flood waters in the provinces of Amite and Wilkinson in the southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and sons were among the rescued on Friday near Gloster.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet away from his house, the Beaver Creek water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another, nearby boy was warning him.
“We woke up, and the water just continued to rise,” Hansford said.
It extended to my belt.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen a dive of water so high over the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members were all injured, and that he was the only swimmer.
Hansford said the rescue personnel saved the triangle in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods will “speed up rapidly” as the heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely tired of the heavy rain that continued since Wednesday.
A heavy rainfall and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of the province of Tangipaho from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL that a member of the city council in Tangipaho said 200 houses were left under the flood.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained contaminated with the rise water.
The towns of Amit and Hammond are open to protection for those who have been evacuated.
“They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water begins to fall,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, in the province of Tangipaho, a couple of streets were closed due to the rise of water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sand shells to try to keep the water away from their homes and movements.
“The last major flood here was in March,” said the city administration Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said the rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said the houses were with flooding on Thursday, but no flooding has been on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain continues.”
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means the second six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
The grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown received a number of shootings, including his legs, legs, hands and stomach, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of nuts,” the boy’s grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can’t believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition is registered as critical, and he has been performed several operations.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first class at the local secondary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown square.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot from the front of the car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
The researchers tell the CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
Attack weapons types, which are derived from various attack weapons, filled the place of the event.
It seems that it was a continuous struggle.
There were hills on both sides of the street.
“It seems there were a number of armed fighters here and they were in an active battle,” Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrest has been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating the tape of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got a misguided blow to her hands on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He is recovering and the police are still searching for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabbya, and Laureta?
So I’m inviting this year’s women’s Olympic fitness team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three footballers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, which is supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team seems, in the end, from America.
It has also established the inclusion of dark and Latin American women at the top of the species.
The most successful female trainer in the past four years has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as an Olympic winner, and America hurried.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible achievements of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but championship fitness programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman who has successively won the individuality in the multi-match of women.
And team brother Aly Raisman got the silver.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation does not appear like this in the gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same path as Aly and Madison arrived in the Olympic team.
They’re “Final Five” (the last five), because in the next Olympic fitness team there will be only four athletes, and this is Marta Karolini’s last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that fitness is a expensive kind, and fitness professionals usually practice in private fitness clubs managed by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their fitness professionals as well as families) and the list continues.
A large part of these fitness clubs are located in rich suburban suburban areas that can support the species.
In these clubs, athletes get all their training, and this is a expensive and long-term commitment to the families of athletes.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez' coach, both have trained their athletes since they started fitness.
We need to bring more affordable and affordable fitness training to the communities in which the numerous young girls who are excited by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my fitness foundation 20 years ago.
In our organizations, we have provided free and affordable fitness training in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level fitness for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic genre.
Physicists develop the strength of the body, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind rigidity, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health as well as school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start fitness, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing your serious “childhood” by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way to a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical practitioners organize new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing to a improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58 percent of the 37,000 practitioners who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that NHS was “on unknown ground” and that even small additional delays damage staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners are transferred to a new agreement, which includes changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Professionals Committee, said last night in a statement: “The doctors are still serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally.”
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract is only eight weeks left, progress has to be made and the time is over.
BMA’s attempts to resolve disputes through negotiations have encountered the government’s unwillingness to participate and from time to time deep silence.
Despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt last month that his doors will always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, eliminate the penalty and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not do so, the doctors are ready to continue the work fighting actions.
The last strike in late April meant 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception times were delayed, as nurses and consulted doctors were charged to act as the locators of the strike guards.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekend wage for the 54,000 medical practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chief Executive Officer of the NHS Employers Association, attracted medical practitioners to prevent them from going to strike.
Mortimer said: “The work struggles are very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disturbance to patients, caregivers and their families.”
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and manifestations (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hoping that the continuous positive discussion of other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional education for those returning from Saturday, education costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender wage differences in medicine – will be a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health are in respect of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Paying 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attacks are benefiting from two pounds per day of the drug after the authorities recommended it to be administered to people for longer.
A drug that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurring scores in people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or a second stage.
NHS Supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS’s supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them suffer from a second stage or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the fat substance accumulated in the arterial wall, which forms a stretch.
If the stretch breaks, it can cause blood clot, which prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the swelling disappears, it can go along with the blood and interrupt the circulation of the blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already received one scene have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the collapse less likely.
Today published NICE’s guidelines suggest that 90 mg ticagrelor should be administered to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin taking twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Without progress in the availability of preventive treatments, even a quarter of people with a heart attack will later suffer from a second heart attack or a stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of recovery can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in decreasing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagreloria, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for several thousand of those potentially beneficial people.
Since the information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - especially as regards the risk of bleeding - for periods of more than three years is limited, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the election flower in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year due to corruption, giving a reference to the government’s report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that the widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities has been ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has sentenced the police, electoral guards and city officials to ignore the evidence of the elections due to “excess sensitivity to race and religion.”
The former Community Secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-Corruption, said that the terrorism of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to place guard chains outside the voting places to protect the scared voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests that the finger of the voting person should be placed with an irreversible mustard so that no one can vote twice.
They should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls on the press to have broader access to the documents and decisions made by informal committees or the working group.
“This would not only protect the electoral foil, but it would protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with the electoral foil,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the ballot scandal in the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the special election court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed as a result of numerous accusations of corruption and illegal acts.
The court ruled that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman said he “led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of a person voting by appearing somewhere else.
Sir Eric said the evidence of false is found throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern in the voting post, in which the members of the high-righteous Muslim community were said to have pressed people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including identity verification with a identity certificate
“The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly, in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
“There were concerns that ... state institutions had ignored such behavior due to ‘politically correct’ racial and religious over-sensitivity.”
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals to clean up the system. These included the refusal that political activists could process the voting bills received by mail in order to end the “collection of voices”.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also requires stricter revisions for registered persons in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options to verify the identity of voters before voting.
Use the untouchable must on the finger of the person who votes so that no one can vote twice.
Do systematic nationality checks to make sure they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by mail.
Avoid political activists from dealing with ready-made votes coming through the mail and the booklet in which the votes are sent.
Let the police put security chains around the voting places.
Amend the law so that it is easier to blame people for fearfulness under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photographs in voting places illegal.
It requires that the voting places use only English (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the cup alone.
Sir Eric says it’s “surprising” that no criminal accusation has been raised after the Tower Hamlets incident.
“The Supreme Court will remain the result of the numerous corruption and illegal actions of Lutfur Rahman and his official,” he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without any doubt, according to criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective “crowd-to-crowd inspections” in the voting registration agencies of the municipal councils.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s Tower Hamlets trial was a awakening.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birth of parliaments, but this worrying and confidential spread of the electoral paper and the denial of facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation.”
Crazy Riding Cyclist and Other Celebrity Showing Pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone confused with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double-cover of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Deputy is not the only golden-fighting athlete this summer who can scratch with his famous double-isolation - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rion matches and all the famous faces that are currently on our rows, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrity.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Squad, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Kate double assembly found on the cyclist, many people on the internet have been quick to note how one of the certain glitters could be the star of the Leonardo DiCaprio Twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Squad, has caused a storm on Twitter after he appeared on his pictures in which he appears as scary as the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, getting aware of the social media boom, the shooters acknowledged that he has heard from childhood he looks like Leo.
“I don’t see much similarity, except in relation to the couple,” Brady told Huffington Post.
“He’s a good guy, so that’s a kindness.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely arise this year: a striking similarity between the British long-range shooter Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The great, apparent eye of the Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina is said to be the double-isolation of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefa.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been for years compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison.
A bigger shift to the eye: This user believes Nathan is the “sport version” of the Inception actress
Another long-term comparison was between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong corners and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more of the same actor with Annalynne McCord than a broken skin and a bright shell, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of “Joseph Gordon Levitt’s sports version”.
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of theory: According to this user, there may be a cause of similarity between the couple
One user on Twitter immediately expressed his happiness on the site that “other on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to the actor Laura Linney's smile, as well as the golden medal winner athlete Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful, broad smile is accurate with the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC's Olympic Commentator Apologizes After saying a Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
The Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the fourth-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200-meter women’s release message raised the viewers of the CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its interlocutors said that a 14-year-old Chinese female was “destroyed like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig.”
The interlocutor Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the 4x200-meter release message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s news agencies to bring “color,” was heard to say, “Take a 14-year-old boy from China, baby.
He was so enthusiastic, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese merchant Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the message in the second quarter at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Guests around Canada react quickly online shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Are the CBC spokesman just saying that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot did not realize that he was still in direct broadcast.”
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as follows in the 4 x 200 meters message final of the women’s liberation: “Take a 14-year-old boy from China, baby.”
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was sharp and fast, many challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how unrighteous Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who played CBC's broadcast, apologized in a direct broadcast for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming show was posted.
It was an unfortunate choice, we’re sorry that this happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted as a response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize for MacDonald’s.
After that, CBC copied and attached an excuse to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
We took rapid action yesterday evening and apologized in a direct broadcast to our viewers and followers on social media.
For clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable word choice, and Byron is very sorry for his statement.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a direct broadcast and tried to define his comment by stating that he did not mean to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made yesterday after a message from women,” she said in an Olympic message to CBC.
“I refer to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.”
“It seems unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean dishonorable, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s customer is furious about a woman who furiously arranged underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman drowned in the middle of Primark’s movement to try underwear.
The things were not improved by the fact that after assessing how she looked in the pants, the woman cut them out of her head and put it back on the plate.
He continued the tour and eventually agreed four underwear shops in a store located in the Bouverie Square shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman arranged underwear and then put them back on the plate
At the same time, the mother of two children in the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after trying underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
He said, “People didn’t believe their eyes.”
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of underwear, scratched her own dresses and underwear, and placed her fit legs.
“He didn’t even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood in it without shame.”
“Everyone looked at him, when he wrapped his underwear again and did not like them, because he put them back on the roof.”
He did the same in three more cases before he finally decided that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
“He didn’t seem to care who was looking at – or thought of a man who would end up buying the underwear he agreed.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent City, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but has not been cleaned.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is quite good.”
“It would be horrible to go home with new underwear and see that another woman has worn them on and cut them out, and they are not washed.”
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the intervention that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the sale.”
This is how you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga.
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to a New York-based Krav Maga Federation mayor Rhon Mizrach to find out how to deal with the stop-wrapping thieves nearby.
Approached to you either in front or back, this video shows you how you can pay to the attacker with the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached backward, the first one to turn is to see your attackers and “reveal the fire line.”
Then press the weapon between your tear and shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free tear.
Continue by striking your leg on your legs, and when the attacker goes from the pain to the scratch, throw the weapon out of his hands, throw him with the weapon behind his face and turn back keeping the weapon targeted on him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the fireplace, press the weapon and turn it around so that the criminal cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon from him, turn back and show him with the weapon.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember that if you’re not Krav Magan Major, the safest way to get rid of the rape situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright slides the dirtyest places in Europe for a tour guide
The British tourist has put a serious challenge to his immune system and his vomiting reflexes by sliding some of the most dirty and nightly places in Europe.
Suffolk's writer and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, wiped an eurosetle, a scroll in the Piccadilly Circus, a train bath washing button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before scanning each object, he used a photographer to show himself and us the situation he was undergoing.
The experiment, which was made in a film called Inner Power, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of sliding the train washing button used by thousands of people may seem completely disadvantaged, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen lavender.
On his journey around Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about reinforcing intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his slices left him another evil taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known intestinal endurance tester when he travelled around the world and eaten strange and wonderful things.
This task from public railway stations to the toilet seat washing button actually tested his immune system.
In the film she said, “Since a child, I’ve been quite concerned about my health, and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth, starting from the mole, the mole, and the curry water.”
He actually strengthened his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused to do was a contaminated Russian public toilet.
In his exhibition, he had more than 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the number of opposed hands should be less than 60.
But in one Russian public hall, he did not agree to shoot when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, The Trace of the Inner Power, together with the Finnish Meyer, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, “This is almost the worst thing I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty.
I’m not going to go there because there’s a nightmare here.
The traces of internal power were produced together with the Finnish meyer, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the Valio Interfires, Mesh and New Categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be exciting to see, and that would at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea ‘Let’s call Ian’.”
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a greater context: telling our daily environment about the good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can interestingly tell more about it to consumers.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The director of the documentary, Tom Hakala, added: “Let’s say it now, though this is the way: if Ian had swallowed some of the things I asked him, such as the nightly Russian tour show in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understoodly, some of the flushing things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I’m glad we got some of those dirty shots recorded.”
In a 2015 survey by Valion, 84 percent of respondents linked milk acid bacteria specifically to stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that have added milk acid bacteria.
A family of nightmakers destroyed a renthouse in Saltash, Cornwall, before the wedding
The nightmare family caused 50,000 pounds of damage to their renthouse after they were expelled due to terrorism by neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall's Saltash after they have been complained many times.
When they were forced to be removed from the property, the shocked residential company officials said the property was in bad condition.
The walls were made shooting holes, the floors were broken down, the waste was spread to the floor, and the walls were wrapped with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in a private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of the Cornwall Housing company, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, “This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is poor, and their name is poor.”
The couple had three boys who lived between in the property, and the police said the family's horror included street gambling at basketball stores, intimidation of close residents, drug use, drug sale, and overwhelming screaming, disputes and curse.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the rental contract, was sentenced in June to be unsocial.
Many of the rooms in the house were found old waste.
The property, from which the drugs were previously transmitted, the floors were broken up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called to the place.
Cornwall Housing saved forces from the property of the woman and this partner this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the boyfriend, saying that their lives had become the same hell.
One said, “They didn’t care for anyone.”
We have lived with their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We have seen the police here incredibly many times.
“Today morning we didn’t sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we haven't used to it!
It’s great now that they’re finally gone.”
Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Executive Director Adam Fitzpatrick said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were called to the property often
Clothes and old toys are thrown down on the wild walls of the renthouse.
He added: “It’s unfortunate that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, as the wrath is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions scared the neighbors.
I appreciate the work of my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the courageous members of the community that gave us information.
I hope this development will bring something to comfort the neighbors and send a message that anti-social behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all twenty.
After the cold, a dirty patch left on the floor of one bedroom
Employees of the housing company now have to clean the house surrounding waste pipes
In 2014, the police broke down the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as va’an, supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after being charged with possession of a B-Class drug with the intention of distributing it.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's grave, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless and are now frozen in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had graffiti.
The police say they are trying to get rid of the inhabitants who keep the rules of their rental agreement misleading.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall said the bullying was a clear warning to other renters who continue to keep the rules shaking.
“This is a message to those who think their behavior is without penalties, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared when a military jet flighted on the beach at the low hipo
Solar tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experience their life shock
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force is going to pass from a very low level.
The air force said it was an exercise flight and said the security was not in danger.
Just at this moment, scared tourists began to shout when a low-flying shower dropped over the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft arrived almost in touch distance from the sun worshippers on the sandstone in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandly worry about the metal that belonged to the shower, even though they didn’t see at first what behind the clouds was coming towards them.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro last night.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic overlapping on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice really low, and at one point it seemed like it was falling into the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like a plane had fallen on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were scared when the plane appeared from darkness and flown at an incredibly low level.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on an exercise flight intended to identify fishing vessels near the coast, and the aircraft had to land so low because it was the only way to check the vessels.
He said the shower had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke in the nearby ground fires, but the air force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, earthquakes have destroyed parts of the Continental Portugal, and four people have been killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low visibility due to the conditions that disrupted the visibility, the smoke caused by earthquakes, and the thick bush.
The aircraft was on an exercise flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The results of the first half of the year are better than expected.
The Social and Health Circle of South Carolina (Exote) made a thumb - in June 3.4 million euros from planned a better result.
The exotic outcome was 4.3 million euros in the first half of the year.
The outcome was good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dissolve institutional care.
Treatment is performed in all operations.
The project is aiming to shorten the measures this year.
Exot covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining percentage may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The annual outcome is estimated to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The exotic government will discuss a half-year review in its meeting on Wednesday.
70 Specialist border doctors swear to military wreck in Immol
A total of 70 guard officers of the Border and Maritime Guard School swore on Friday.
The military strike of the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immol on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Medical Course was held at the guard sports field.
He swears to 70 soldiers.
Special border doctors are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year there are 310 specialists.
250 of them were called for the trial.
Specialist border doctors have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the war.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Screenshots above - Criminal representation helps in the detection of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has since the beginning of 2014 operated a RTA (criminal reporting and analysis unit).
The activity of the unit is outwardly invisible.
The police department has a total of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinn.
It is drawn by a placed overcontainers.
The Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the force of the unit belongs to a civil person dedicated to the information technology in Hämeenlinn.
Everyone works in civil society.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, says assistant police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations to the other police.
It has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest workplace reform
The establishment of the analysis units is the latest reform of the police working methods.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would go more and less often to the place of the pill calls only when they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
In conjunction with the reform of the police administration, one criminal investigation center was established in the country, with less than three state units and each police unit with its own criminal investigation unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the context of the Central Criminal Police in Vanda, leads the activities nationally.
In the PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard are working according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work in the areas distributed by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police and state units.
The information extends beyond its territory.
Where the individual police is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station area.
The information extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because it is the crime.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better ATK skills than the basic police.
The unit strives with the help of records, the alarm data base and the detections to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or one another-like crimes.
This is called a series, and it is one of the main tools for criminal investigation.
Everyone has its own way of acting.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the act, a specific image is formed from the factor.
The screening can be done either on the basis of what is done or on the basis of the person, depending on who the police have more information about.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk in the city with their necks straight, but their work is not completely public.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not, as it could lead to the profession criminals to develop their activities and thus seek to prevent the police’s anti-criminal operations.
Police are informed publicly if they predict that they are threatened.
Such a case was, for example, from the beginning of the summer, the method of labelling empty apartments used in housing murders.
In that, the factors placed the outside door of the apartment with a pipe, a knop or a tape, with which they tried whether the inhabitants were really on the way.
The pre-examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The highest points are ordering a court protocol, which may, for example, show that the place has been found with fingerprints.
The next time the thieves go to the hand.
For this matter, the assistant police chief Tero Seppästä Hämeen of the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of the police of Eastern Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä Joensuun of the police station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomelaa of the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyze information that helps to plan practical activities.
Reducing the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information outside the Finnish border.
Islamist schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British students who left London last year to join the Islamic State, has been to have died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl’s family heard of this dead in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, which is the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just as he planned to break from the war-breaking country and to return to Britain.
“I just hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a testament for others, that the departure into the war area is associated with real risks - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other Eastern school girls flown to Turkey, from which they went by bus to the Syrian border.
The sultan family was told that the girl had gone to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter, and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says that the next president will choose the person who has died as a member of the Supreme Court to replace Anton Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday in a telephone conversation that he predicts with “unprecedented certainty” that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was a speculation.
He blamed Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "shake the ship" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "cravings" and "powerers".
He said Trump was not in charge.
Treats says the naked calendar is “for women as well as for men”
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish the 1970s Pirell-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they intend to find the next top generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his full-fledged full-fledged page is different from the old school playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
It seems that he thinks that the calendar is for them.
“We have to start again presenting untemporary and classical nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these naked female skin images,” Shaw said in a press release in which the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave images via the network or personally at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's Destination: Who Really Buy Disks?
Solitary, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you begin to fill a commentary with irritated violations, the author of which is the label NoAllYellowMiddle AgedMen, notice that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of the widely spoken discs is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the renewal of physical objects, but the middle-aged desire.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl plate are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, all of the most unlikely discs to buy belong to the age group of 18-24 years of age.
It is also not just about the collection of enthusiasts, but also about the sensation: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy loneliness (69 % vs 66 %).
But do YouGov’s results be true?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me when I walk in the midst of the busy street in Sohossa, above me a modest gray dress. I would flirt vibrantly before I stop, I would form a cup of my hands and say something prestigious, such as: “Let’s explore the matter in detail.”
Let us examine the matter in detail.
At the same time, when the charm and dirt of Soo are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies are now filling the buildings with previously independent movements - a lot of stunning specialized disks are still left.
For the next section, I’d probably ask the camera to stop capturing for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores when I try to assess by observing their age and feel temperament.
The Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Raysta (calculator: two young women, three middle-age men) Reckless Records (calculator: eight middle-age men, one woman, probably twenty), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and turns around the shops to spend a few hours.
I asked if he was a collector.
“When I am,” he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 discs.
These discs that appear in the picture above (he sent a draft by email, I didn’t follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of discs and singles is partially the result of his available income: now he can buy discs that he had not been able to afford when they were originally published, and he can re-buy those that he sold when he was young and free of money.
“A lot of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, discs that were published when I was 11 or 12, discs that I was probably a little too young to acquire,” he says.
He agrees that the buyers of discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own companions, and adds: “I don’t burn and I don’t drink a lot.
This is my sin.”
The 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Rays, also believes that many of the customers he encounters will fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the discs have come back to fashion and who have become the need to buy their old discs back.
Based on the discussions I went, people have gained a break from their collection in general in 1998 or 1999.
“Clients who sell their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their CDs back,” he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl herbs in a certain age.
But what about the alleged recording?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that the disc stores offer a comforting community for the same-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured especially by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans may get cracked by the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of familiar discs; objects that wake up the memories of teenage days of luck.
“I think that sometimes it may be a matter of filling a gap or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector, I also admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It is a simple way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers!” another worker said suddenly to the plate.
A survey conducted by ICM revealed that 50% of people who had purchased a vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a dish that they never use, while 7% of vinyl purchases don’t have a dish.
In this point of the news report, I’d probably seem to be seriously concerned when I browse the pine of the bossa nova collections.
This “premium” perspective of awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who works in the Sounds of the Universe, has also noticed.
“Someone came in a short time ago and said, ‘I don’t have a dish, but I want to buy a Radiohead dish so that we can put it on the roof’,” she says.
This is not a big percentage, but this is definitely happening.
More music, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a disorder.”
Not the older people, but the younger people, the late age, who are just excited about it.
In Fopp, where today there is almost a whole layer reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Though the atmosphere is less relaxed than the previously mentioned moves - from the sounding of the wild beast to the fresh synchronous and sex-style pop, and not the improvisation jazz - it is great to see a variety of customers.
No one of them seems lonely, but a flattering psychological trauma is difficult to prove true by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppy for a few minutes watching the various discs available for sale.
He’s doing window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn’t make a lot of money, so disc collection isn’t actually an option.
“It is expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is...” she shakes in love.
“I don’t know how to explain – it’s really unique.”
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I try to look like I’m exploring the fark-shorts, I observed a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter thought about buying Crosley’s disc.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's discs: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential discs of any medium collection.
No one looks at them - because they are just decorated, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
These are purely “art vinyls”.
But having regard to the fact that the little attention obtained by these objects can mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers to the Soso feeders to seek more, there is no much to complain about here.
It will not be surprising that the population with others more likely to have more time and money is also the one that uses the most for luxury materials, such as vinyls.
But even though my findings indicate that the results of YouGov are accurate at least in the Saha disks, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, disks and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday morning wrapping around Berwick Street’s dishwashers, scrolling the discs and avoiding the striking, 30-year-old TV player’s look at this throat over the shoulders of unconscious middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living spinal animal - video report
Scientists say holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spinal cord.
According to Julius Nielsen, the record is for a cow who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
French court rejects lawsuit to dismiss shops from Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a trial this week, the Calais authorities justified that the state should be able to dissolve a total of 72 temporary trade where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pounds) or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais prefecture agency justified that the places should be dissolved because they represent tax unpaid parallel economy and because they are a fire and cleaning risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the state-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They justified that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
The court ordered that there were no legal grounds for the dismissal of 72 temporary traders, but said the concern of the Calais prefect was “comprehensible.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants played a much greater role than just eating people “who live in extremely uncertain conditions”.
He said the premises provided peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under displacement was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe, which operates unprofitably and offers 200 meals per day, English and French hours, and asylum guides for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that closing a cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people – to the top – since the number of arriving has risen drastically during the summer.
Food prices fall faster than the average in the EU
Food in Finland is drastically reduced for the joy of consumers and for the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by five percent in three years, while the average price in EU countries has fallen by 0.9 percent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland to the second most in the EU countries with the same salary level as in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information comes from the statistics center’s development director Ilkka Lehtisen’s writing, which was published on the info & trends blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food increased drastically.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We are close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is burdened by the prohibitions imposed by Russia on food imports, which have disrupted food shipping from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The sharp price competition between industry and trade has also influenced the price decline.
The big trade chains of the S-Group and Central have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been shown as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is not yet a stool of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive in the EU with the same salary level as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the net countries had the same VAT percentage, the third cheapest food from the same countries would be sold in Finland.
The newspaper translated Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven, only the Germans and the Netherlands would sell food cheaper than the Finnish.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve the VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The newspaper notes that his calculations on the VAT percentage are orientative.
The school is no longer the same.
If you go back to the school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been prepared, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
This is the guidance that all schools in Finland are operating.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old in many ways.
In other words, the teaching of beauty writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
The school starts at 6th grade and the school starts at 4th grade.
The major change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was previously thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make the school more interesting.
The world's longest backbone is found - ice hole can live up to 400 years
Also known as the glacier, the Somniosus microcephalus only reaches genocide at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal community it is only passed by an Icelandic flock, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland flows along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The rabbits stretch the dogs longer, they can grow even more than five centimeters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to surveys only about a centimeter per year, adults have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen with his colleagues made it clear.
He identified adult ice hills from 28 hills that had remained in the fishing of the fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carboning of the glasses.
The average age of the whales studied was at least 272 years.
The two greatest fish in the vacuum, the 493 and 502 cent amatsonian frogs, were discovered at the age of about 335 and 392.
Since previous studies have found that ice cranes only reach more than four meters of relativity, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann's withdrawals to almost 300 - sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann.
The co-operation companies in the difficult company ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be dismissed,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to this, the number of sellers in the warehouses will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
Moreover, approximately 80 employees in support operations will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann’s YT negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
It was estimated that there were approximately 380 employees.
The reduction aimed at an annual cost savings of approximately 20 million euros, which are expected to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency program, which is intended to a savings of €50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties of Stockmann to get profitable from the trade in goods.
Although the group's refined turnover improved in the second quarter to €11.1 million, the goods store still makes losses.
The CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalaisen, said the sales in the warehouses have not exceeded the goals set by the company.
“People’s reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive turnover of Stockmann Retail in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
On the background of the result improvement in the second quarter was especially the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved the best of all time in the second quarter with its turnover and outcomes.
Lindex’s business profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s turnover was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the company’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The refined turnover is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rain on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rainfall in the middle of the country, but in the south there is pouta.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the whole country remains below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the rainy regions of the north, it remains at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's general sports team is scattered by doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's temptation
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP that the athlete in which Anzrah tried to appear was the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenian national team, said the identity of Anzrahi was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprising test.
Doping operators were presented to the Anzrahi authorities.
Soin said Anzrah was sent home because he "covered his crime against the Kenian national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We can’t accept such a behavior,” Kenian Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The general Olympics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the rider is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenian general sports team, in turn, claimed that Anzrah passed with an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the gambling village.
When antidoping worker met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be revealed," the source said.
Where are they all?
Rio's sports stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
The struggle for the medals of general sports began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top clubs were able to show their skills to a confusing empty view.
Rion organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day breakfast tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulled by a hurrying crowd.
Tickets for the final in Rio are already sold.
The Rion Olympics has already attracted attention before the public sports.
For example, in the sights of rugby, melon and riding has seen thousands of empty spots.
When Brazilian medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian duel, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30% of the 12,000 views were filled.
Bad excursions are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian sports tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
Nevertheless, even the first match of the Brazilian football team didn’t get the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the match organizers, said this weekend that the tickets were sold at the time by 82 percent, a clearly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," Andrada said to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million London Olympics tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost half more than in Rio.
Ticket prices in Rio have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets are less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet permitted because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
The organizers in Rio have given 240,000 tickets to school students in the country for less-known species such as golf and rugby.
In the morning there were empty places.
Even the beach ball on Copacaba's sand has not been interested in the public.
The competition was held in London in 2012.
People in newspapers are enough.
A New Way to Protect Nature – Get Right to Land Area
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to the protection of nature by new means.
The Foundation, which was founded last year, will acquire ecologically important natural areas to its ownership.
After that, individuals, enterprises and entities can rescue the ownership of the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land from Lap.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks, which the desirable can acquire for the payment of ownership.
The holder receives a veto right to his block of 187 square meters, which in practice means that no approval from each holder is required if the purpose of the land is intended to be changed.
Property rights can also be obtained to multiple blocks.
The acquisition of administrative authority is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banderols or catch yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Joha Leviäkangas, who acquired the management right for his company, justifies.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, allowing for example a visit to the block.
On the foundation’s website, the name details of the acquisition of ownership rights are compiled on the same map from which the block details of the land area are found.
Leviäkangas sees its natural protection procurement as a risk only by the fact that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public benefit foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas in such a way that they can be intact and quiet.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founder.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protective countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish border and plans to acquire immigrants from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce on 13-19 August.
Bicycle thieves torture the worst of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the worst of Finnish major cities.
This year there have been more rounds stolen compared to the number of inhabitants in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the cycling theft to the police, Helsingin Sanomat how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, counted per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turkey, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the top.
According to the police, there were four to five cycling cases per thousand inhabitants.
In Espo and Kouva, the police were only about two cycling theft per thousand inhabitants.
That is the big difference.
“In other cities, the number of theft is proportional to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Administration.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It’s extremely difficult to say why more wheels are stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of the theft can be affected by how much cyclists are moving in the city and how many wheels there are at all," thinks the supercontroller Teemu Äikäs.
Police department Tommi Reen says it is quite anticipated that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of cycling theft goes largely depending on what are the study and cycling cities.
The market has a close center, short distances and a lot of wheels available to the thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city, where the city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
According to the police, there have been a little less cycling cases in January-August compared to the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decrease in recent years, the police are informed about a little more than 20,000 cycling robbery per year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bicycles per year.
“These are large amounts,” Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more rounds, as only a few of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on the people to make a criminal report on cycling theft, although less than every ten cases to the police survive.
A typical detected bicycle theft is one in which the police get information about theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
“These cases will also be resolved in the context of other investigations, when, for example, in a drug displacement, stolen wheels can be found in an apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cycling thieves are arrested weekly for their own work or in the context of a police investigation, says the senior counterpart Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from the wheels of the shopping centers, the inside shelves, the warehouses and the wheels of the wheels, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
Most of the individual wheels are stolen, as in previous years, Jopoja.
The U lock provides a better protection to the bicycle than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bicycles ends in sale, for example via the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“Not yet the police have come to the knowledge that the stolen wheels will almost go abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen wheels, according to the police, are ordinary Finns.
Some people will buy a stolen bicycle without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bicycle must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hiding or infringement.
“The alarm clocks should be called if a good-conditioned bicycle is sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries the colour Nopsa all the time of his working day to the protectors of the Kallion library in Helsinki.
He has had five pieces of wheels, but no one has been stolen, says the Monkey. ”He has never been taken, there has been a good monk.”
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily a hipster value here," the Helsinki Monkey thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, closed his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bicycle drops to the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bicycle into something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“There’s a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” the Helsinki student says about his white bicycle, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken.”
“To avoid bad rounds, such spiders.”
A motorcycle was stolen from the house house a year ago.
The bicycle was unlocked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be found.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki tests U.S.-known counterfeit crews
In Helsinki, we are testing the so-called counterfeit crew to prevent young people from entering a criminal streak.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
This is the first crime committed by the young man.
The idea is that the counterfeit team discusses the incident with the criminal and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the criminal may join the counterfeit staff to refund his act.
Other consequences can be, for example, a letter to the family, which explains what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We also have other modes of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone guides the youth’s activity in a more responsible direction so that everyone doesn’t break the first mistake,” Laitio says.
It has been adopted a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young man does not fall in front of the adult panel, but reflects what has happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service director at Palmua, who followed the experiment, said it was a misconduct that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have previously been treated at all.
“It’s been a message that you’re going on the way you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
It is part of the Immigrants’ Helsinki project, which is based on the Helsinki City and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new approaches will be offered to all those in need, not just to the immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter was addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The subscribers want the party’s money to be transferred to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indifference, disqualification and record disadvantage threaten to bring voting to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-covered anchor in their neck.
The letter says the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organized persons in the letter is apparently opponent to Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have inflicted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. children
In the U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am seeking to be president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
“Donald Trump seeks to become president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
The center of Clinton’s plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve the U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly funded by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The building program is a hand cleansing for American duunars who suffer from factory shifts to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We’re building, we’re building again.
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working children’s families.
On Thursday, Sanders said that wealthy people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax refuge, it will have to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I am against any trade agreements that act against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the Washington Post's speculation published before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday because it "admired just these kinds of millionaries."
Trump’s proposed royalty to lower corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called “Trump’s bourgeoisie.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of the small whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making the products himself in America,” Clinton said.
This is Rion’s viewers: The matches have not attached the Finnish to the roofs, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports pads appear in TV viewers statistics as sharp mountains.
The Olympics in Rio have not yet reached the highest number of viewers.
At the same time, the matches have clinged to the roofs at the best of 12 percent of the population: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time by 615,000 viewers.
For comparison: a month ago, the general sports EM championship received almost 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, and the football EM championship just another million.
The most of the Olympics have so far been interested by Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day opened tennis training, which both reached the Olympic channel almost half a million viewers at a time.
General sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the viewers, and reminds that the viewers are divided at the Rio Olympics for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnish players are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much TV viewers in general choose the Olympics.
On the TV side, the viewers are distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports clubs to be held by Yle.
If the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the entire time of viewing is from 20,000 to 500,000, then it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference – a large part of Rio’s match broadcasts come in Finland at night.
A second reason for a lazy interest – if it is now one who considers it a lazy – is a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprising medal from the first round, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is just starting, just like other species of Finnish interest: swimming and riding.
The number of viewers was close to what was expected.
When the sport starts, the spectators explode.
Yle launched for the matches the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which appeared in the first days of the matches in the Apple App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150,000 times.
I’m sure we’re going to have 200,000 downloads.
“We will only get the web viewers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users hopefully.
It says the feedback has arrived and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the applications that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics appear on the Channel and Arena of Yale more broad than any other sporting event ever before.
The General Fem channel can be followed by some species, and the General Speech radio broadcasts matches daily.
The Olympics are not only the most busy for Yule ever, but also the last that can only be followed by Yule channels.
As of 2018, the Olympic Games will be broadcast on both Top and Commercial Channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijän, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Cross Island.
It may be even deeper.
Technical assistant educator Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Cross, with a submarine computer displaying a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Center tried in vain to strengthen the observation by all-saving.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far the official depth remains 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters range from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as thoroughly as the Lightning.
In particular, the basement of the Inari Lake is not accurately maped.
“There could be an unknown depth,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average, it is the Great Jukajjärvi, 23 meters.
With this view, your Day will not reach the top ten, and the Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: The last paragraph was corrected, in which the deepest lakes of their middle depth were wrong.
Taxation: Pension taxation increases
The taxation of pensioners is still more rigorous than the taxation of payers.
It says that the disadvantage arose during the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to payers.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
We think that should definitely be there.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, the employers received reductions on income, which reduced the taxation.
The matter warmed in the parliament representatives of the opposition, who blamed the promises of the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia.
The purchasing power is saved, it does not grow.
According to the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpon, the issue of tax cuts is mainly to safeguard the purchasing power and not to increase, since the wages will not be raised next year.
He says that tax reduction positively affects purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Idea is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) and Orpo on the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement achieved through effort.
He says that keeping the agreement up is important for reliability.
It is the main economic and employment policy of the government.
It is done by the power of the labour market organizations, so it should not be overwhelmed by questioning.
It comes into need because the economy is so much in the midst of domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Long-term unemployment in the UK
It calls on the government that it should take over long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed in June was approximately 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will disappear.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in the attack in Thailand
At least four people were killed in a bomb attack in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish citizens to be careful and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the guidelines of the authorities.
Finish tourists who are scheduled to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's guidelines should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand, although the exact number of them is difficult to estimate.
The Thai tour is scheduled for the end of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish citizens in Thailand via Facebook after the bombing.
The embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hinis in particular to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently away from the city.
In general, everything seems to be good, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says there is no information about the cause of the attack.
The ambassador believes that the events may be associated with the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military forces.
The law was approved in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among others, people were arrested who claimed to be opposed to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist attractions.
Today is a great, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She says that the city is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very accurate about security.
Police in Thailand: It is not international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, the Thai police news agency AP said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourists’ favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination in Phuket, four bombs exploded in the night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not demand victims.
Two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ng, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at the recommended tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one of the two bombs died.
In South Thailand, in the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao's holiday islands.
The cause of the attack is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the Thai military, said the attack was unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don’t want to let people panic anymore, he told reporters.
Security Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist sites.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finnish citizens to be careful and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the guidelines of the authorities.
Financers who are planning to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the guidelines of the Embassy should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Until now, very little is known about the attacks that occurred during the night in Finland.
There is a little more information about the attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last Hua Hin attack.
Two bombs exploded at the headquarters of the clock tower.
The Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb, according to the province's governor, was hidden in a flower box.
A local employee was killed in the attack.
There are at least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs exploded every half an hour during the attack on Surat Than.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two police stations.
U.S. Biles Wins Women's Quartet
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was third with a score of 58,665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still struggling to play in the Rion matches with permano, jumping and throwing.

The more cool MM metals in Biles have jumping and trees.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Islam has no impact on tourism”
In Phuket, Thailand, Esa Huovila, who runs a property mediation office and a children's playground in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombing attacks on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, then I don’t think there will be anything more miraculous about this, according to the Finnish entrepreneur Huovila, who has worked in Asia for about two decades.
Experienced entrepreneur has seen from close many tragedies experienced in Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previously have not deported tourists, then hardly that too.
The company’s office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
He heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the beach and the main road of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the taxes were placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's feast in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was quiet and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach had not heard of the attack.
Half three hours a day in the Thai time at Patong, traffic was normalized and a large portion of stores had opened their doors.
The explosion was quite small, according to the police.
The car was later seen at the Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party found two men fit to the signs hidden in a close sixth place.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other man fled, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and severe damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research Director on the Change of Leadership in Russia: Clear Departure
In Russia, the highest-value leadership change was made on Friday after President Vladimir Putin dismissed his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is the 44-year-old Estonian Anton Vaino.
He was an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's double man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He added that recycling of leadership positions is one way of power use.
This is a way to prevent people from gathering the president-independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught up with other managers or mocked.
Resignation to Ivanov
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin's internal circle, is transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
In a press release, Putin said the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested transfer to other duties and proposed persecution in his place, Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view it is a clear decline in position.
Environment and transport are not very important in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a major role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential follower of Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, for example governors, have been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's place's heir is that Putin changes his neighborhood to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human beings to withdraw from Syria
They used civilians as humans when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we didn’t target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish militants captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij.
According to estimates, dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We previously wrongly said that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publication of documents is illegal, says public law professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that the publicity of the document cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior has previously refused to disclose the list of participants of the Ministry of the Interior's opportunities to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council's chancellor and with the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s communication director tells the STT that the ministry has a significant need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the values.
He broke his back from the beginning of the season and was forced to leave the Jamaican Olympic Championships.
This wasn’t a perfect preparation, but I’m much better.
I’ve practiced well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-covered sambat dancers and fan-made journalists.
Porina Bolt tells the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era in which public sports have fought with doping scandals and bone marrow interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in 2004 in Athens, where he climbed 200 meters in a time of 21,05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his domination began at a hundred meters, by which he broke the world record and the competitors’ self-confidence, despite the final celebration in the time of the birth of 9,69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career with a clock measurement.
The world record in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 meters is still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that it will pursue a 200-meter world record and a 19-second underground, but no one believes it will be born except Bolt himself.
Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Athens 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
In the last year's World Cup in Beijing, Bolt dropped the American in just one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not been in Beijing during the beginning of his reign and has not lost the values in the final even once, if he has just reached the journey.
During the 2011 World Cup in Daegua, Bolt failed to run because of a scam.
Bolt will complete a lot of a week after 30.
He is an old man in the young men's genre, and the Rion matches are his last Olympics.
Bolt is the last player to play the World Cup next year in London.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I’m older and it’s more difficult.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Previous Post:Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhuan, the 18-year-old Chinese martyr Chen Xinyi has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
In the doping sample of Chen Xiny, a Chinese murderer, found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian shooter Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She ranked fourth in the 100 meters female race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese murderer has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports (CAS).
Xinhua reports that Xiny's sample on Sunday had found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are other doping attacks in Rio.
The Bulgarian female shooter Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya has passed a sports coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had become an athlete in a test case and had given a doping sample for it.

According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre rider Ferguson Rothic's basketball pass.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historic gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the U.S. Michael Phelps swim in 200 meters mixed in his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic balls.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic Cup in four consecutive matches.
Phelps' time of victory was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the mixture before Chinese Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to keep a little fun, BBC's Olympic counterpart Helen Skelton laughs in a brief interview with Iltaleht.
The story made on Monday on Helen Skelton is the most read this week on the Webpage.
The commentator is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get a lot of stress if there’s a little bit of his revealing and special houses in the Somes or the British newspaper.
The TV is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has been dressed in high-range shoes and a short-range dress that will have at least sufficient exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
Backpacks are not permitted.
It’s important to look good, and small potatoes are just a fun thing.
Skelton is sure he wants to get rid of and to get troubled, but he emphasizes he doesn’t want to be in the main role.
This is not about me, he says.
Here we are looking at the sport, and focus must be on the athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I’m dressing.
Can you imagine that the storm has surpassed Finland?
I can’t, but everything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers do the work and how big sacrifices they do, is okay for me.
Do you know what?
It is a shade of empty if it comes from clothes.
I’m a little worried if someone has found it.
Rion police arrest two people for terror suspicion

Argentine woman dressed Petäjä-Sirena - Finnish man thought of protest
The wind at Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind was hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Windy Petäjä-Sirena on Thursday in Rio on the opening of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was killed because of the collar, and the others fled, said Finnish coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete has long considered the protest.
It was not worth it because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I had to fall into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finnish fell to his table until the last, because he did not want to fall into the dirty water of Rio.
At the end of the day, the Finnish man left the 27th place.
The London Olympic Championship 2012 is the eighth.
The collapse has not affected much.
Friday is an important day when there is a battle outlets 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend your age
Science has studied everything between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his life is extended.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t affect himself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to a middle-income or a social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don’t always need to get stuck – just seeking milk is enough.
The secret of long age has been sought to be revealed by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange results of the study.
According to science, all of these things could bring more years of life.
Drinking potato and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect some from cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or heart disease.
For the sake of alcohol, research shows that moderate consumption – one to three daily doses – can extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinks lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of a toothbrush can extend a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway revealed how laughter affected the life of a person.
The project, which lasted seven years, attended more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the test ended.
Sex, when protection against sexual diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
It can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to get more years in his life, he also needs to get an orgasm.
Exercise takes more years and it is not to be denied.
However, achieving a long age does not require unconditional cellularity.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women with a big back had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also contained more omega-3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these facts with lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who reached the Olympic medals or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than the usual bottle.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings additional years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that the long age is due to a person’s social status – which, by its own contribution, enables the search for recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on the shopping behavior of people over the age of 65 found that people who shop daily, or less likely to make shopping, become older.
This is due to the fact that rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has also been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may anticipate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - therefore, the online trading does not have the same effect.
A riding truck shooter crashed into a truck.
On Friday night there was a serious shock of a truck and a person's car.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskentien and Sorvastontien on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forsa, when the passenger car that had arrived had moved on the same thread, hit the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained on the roof after the collision, but burned up.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The car crashed on the roof and from there on the roof.
A woman born in 1972, who carried a personal car, was stuck in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the University Central Hospital of Turun for treatment.
The result of the female swelling test was 2.02 promille.
He is suspected of drunk drunk.
Posts sending people to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket's discharge options because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the cargo to the Wall Street.
Teija Haltia, who lived in Perniya, was on Thursday buying vacancies from the Salon K-Citymarket, when a fun blade hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are defects in the packaging, because the Post delivered our load to the Wall!
We will receive more when the mail is delivered!
If you don’t put it in the shell, read it in the shell.
The shopper's catch-leaning side is associated with the fact that the Post extended its services last spring to also touch the grass cutting.
It will always be available to the Post until the end of August.
Haltian said the sand was mostly fun and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the storm.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonder.
On Friday afternoon, the Haltia update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourites in a vacuum bag, although a few laars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Post Corporate Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five scenes were misleading yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we were no longer going to do a part delivery (Saloon) with three, but we took only five scenes today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was the first afternoon news.
Teja Haltia didn’t get angry with the sand because she found all of her own discharge pockets in the selection.

Wish of the family of the murdered woman in Loviisa: victim memories for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hoped that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by a donation for police dogs.
The Zoo Veterinary Department has published a Facebook update in which it communicates the victim's family's wishes for donations to the police dogs.
In the publication it is that the victim had worked as a locator at the Zoo Veterinary Department and also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinarian address reminds the woman with touching words.
Pleasant, intelligent, humorous and work without fear.
A good friend.
However, we cannot fully understand that he is missing.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
In the update it is stated that the donation funds all go to police dogs, primarily to the procurement of security guests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviis woman was murdered in her own home in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The victims said the victim was very animal-friendly.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, cows and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was traced by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest.
But Bourgeois has survived and is recovering.
Court of Appeal sentenced Post for violation of Equality Act
Post was not entitled to retain the salary of the employee who refused to withdraw a rental worker, the Court of Appeal of Kanta-Häme assesses in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal obliged Post to pay the majority of the employee’s arrested salary and €2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post would have been able to withdraw from the remuneration of the perpetrator only the part that corresponded to the perpetrator’s share of the whole day’s work.
In violation of the Equality Act, the employee was placed in a disadvantage status on the basis of his association activity.
The employee had followed the Postal and Logistics Union’s PAU Organizational Decree on the Displacement Prohibition.
In November last year, the PAU made a decision that the Post’s employees do not reject the strike-breaking rental workers.
This was first by the People's News.

Putin resigns head of government - replaces Estonian deputy Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is the son of the Soviet Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
It is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been the Vice-Chairman of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The victim will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax said.
Vladimir Putin has dismissed his head of government.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who belongs to Putin’s close internal circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested transfer to other duties and proposed persecution in his place, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spy.
Many regarded Ivanov as a possible follower of Putin in 2008, but the president became Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's resignation to the game ban - not seen at the opening of the Vali League
The world record player of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English League will be removed to the end of the weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United's reserve acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side due to a game ban when the ManU opens its match against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba 105 million euros to the Italian team, according to British media.
However, the English Football Federation (FA) keeps him away from the game, as Pogbal was burdened by Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a single game prohibition.
The game ban has been transferred to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next goal to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
Flow’s size is good.
The accurate criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally respected event celebrated by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival guests typically express themselves in their own clothes.
One of the main artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is styled, among other things, by workshops and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to be just the headline and the fishing team, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Helsinki Suvilah, has grown from a small card festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
On the background of success, there is a simple question: to what event would the factors themselves want to go?
It is quite different in the event that we think that way.
Often the goal is to the level of necessity and to act in accordance with authority orders, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out this year.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 people by 5,000 last year.
This year, there will be a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The growth of the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a sheep, which is directed on huge trails.
That we don’t want.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the course of 13 years in such a way that in the part-to-the-country area there are 130 performers, art facilities and numerous restaurants and drinking bars.
In addition to the headboard and the smaller showboards, this year a telt of 15,000 people will be held as the place of the castle.
He added that the event could be made easier.
Maybe I’m a little big bull, but at the same time we’ve been able to preserve Flow’s spirit.
If we lose it, this is no longer our matter.
To Kalli, the greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that even today great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the middle of the 21st century, the activity was very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of Flow’s stock company was about 6 million euros.
It can make “cruise things” like the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-dressed clothes.
In addition to the music event, we can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as fashionable.
We want to distinguish it first and foremost by content.
Nevertheless, fashion phenomena also match Flow’s world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the punk legend, the 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but not in the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, he has the most typical performers.
According to Kallion, Iggy was bucked, because now it is probably the last time that this is seen on a peak in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is broadcast on commercial radio.
Iggy's last disc is a good hame and he has made a good hame in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowers - tourists fled in fear
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower coat and exploded with mobile devices.
The bombs were placed on the street, the majority of whose customers are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time that tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia, quotes a much speaking picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn’t look properly, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
A crowd rushed to me and said the bomb exploded near the bar.
It happened at one of the biggest bar roads, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is clearly dead.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
One bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to Thai authorities, behind the bombings are likely rebels who are not satisfied with the actions of Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently engaged in the activities of human trafficking criminals.
KSML: This part of the new preparation groups starts fighting in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the security officers are ordered to take the battle missions only a few months after the prison of the military law, the Central Committee said.
According to the newspaper’s interview with the Defence Forces training chief, Prikaatinkraal Jukka Sonnisen, for example, of the 5.5 months serving equipment men in a war situation are combatable only those who are in the final stage of their training.
According to the training manager, the reserves belonging to the preparation teams are first assigned to the service.
No security officer or reserve officer is ordered for a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train the security personnel in the units of immediate preparation from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during the training of the armor.
Pamela Tola receives remuneration for hometals
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a lot of dispute about the apartment they bought from Espo in 2009.
The trade price of the two-storey separate house was 330,000 euros.
After the trade, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial plantation to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to €132,000, so the financial losses to Tol and Waroma amounted to €198,000.
The couple brought the case to the court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the court and the court.
The court issued a judgment on Wednesday.
It kept in force a judgment of the Court of Appeal, which ordered the seller to pay to Tol and Waroma 150,000 euros of price discount.
In addition, the seller is obliged to compensate the court and investigation costs of the couple for a total of €47,344.
The right of reasonable price reduction was slightly because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when the apartment sale was made.
According to the court, the errors were significantly more serious than the errors were presented.
Looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had precisely sought a well-established home because they didn’t want to start repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basicly renovated and in good condition and that there is no harm to the facts mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The municipal inspection report indicated the risks and inappropriate ventilation and the fact that the management of the rainwater and sulphur waters along the roof is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not show that it would be an urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma remained in the idea that rainwater from the rocks should be somewhat directed in a few years.
The sale was made in October 2009.
Within a few years it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the inspections conducted in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth, which, according to witnesses, was due both to the rainwater of the canyon and to the capillary-rise land.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by microbes, according to the inspector’s estimates, allowed it to enter the interior through the cube.
A health-risking, cross-border foam or slurry was found in slurry samples in the housing room, the elevator staircase, the living room window markers, and the elevator washroom.
It was built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment was extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware before the trade of the decision of the city of Espoo, according to which the apartment had been modified contrary to the permission.
For example, the terrace was built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Homosexual issues were a key issue in the court.
According to the law, the buyers could, on the basis of the data they received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large repairs in the near future.
Tolalla and Waroma did not have a particular reason to do a broader inspection than the usual.
The buyers have not neglected their obligation to subsidize, the court states in their judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter article how the National Archive in Maryland, the United States, has recorded microfilms of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
Moreover, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi Morsiam.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German Racial Agency.
The rabbit agency operated under the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies to even greater amounts of women who had to be able to raise up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological trials to find out the case.
The Rainbow Agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by examining church books.
It was intended to ensure that there were no Jews in women’s sex.
Women should also be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency hand-written life stories and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The rabbit agency wanted guarantees that women were “childdogs”, “saving women” and “good national socialists” who knew well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, prescribed that each SS man should have four children, whether in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program has not been promoted very actively, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum's pages.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage spending by offering loans and supporting children.
The German mother's honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Arabs" and "non-Arabs" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages say.
At the sixth time, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the flight in the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympics, but remained the whole group in the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to the eighth in the overall position after five leaks, but the failure of the second leaks dropped him to the 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought RS:X-class day in the departure places 17 and three.
In the general situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained on the 23th place in the day's opening.
In total, Lindgren is on the 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so in a cloth"
Jari Sillanpää has been among the Finnish favourite artists for more than 20 years.
From the bar of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, to the best-selling solo artist of Finland and to the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää is able to brush further and he is currently in a hurry lift.
A book written by Mari Koppisen, a book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells him about his life and his career in both good and evil.
Sillanpään's career grew to a total rise by winning the tango crown at the Seinäjoen Tang Market in 1995.
In the game, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tangocopy to Sillanpä on the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the sounding of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää singed it on the tape in a terrible crap and only a couple of hours after the nighttime.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stuck!
The bridge is in the book.
As a huge hit to rise the song from the taltiation would not immediately guess that it was singed in the crap.
Although I was not physically the best, the trace was still good.
I learned that all the time I don’t have to demand myself perfect and top.
Another coincidence related to the most popular pieces of the man, which is told in the book, occurred almost a couple of years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his then partner and the case ended in the texts of You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäsele were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a plate that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the piece that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of a 7 days newspaper.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for the divorce between Jari and his ex-lover was Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was a full puppy and was not true.
Jari called the book in anger to the disc company and refused to sing the song, but he ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting for their empire out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters voted for the dissolution and 48 per cent would remain in the Union, although the voting week’s opinions predicted the opposite result.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous on the standpoint of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutions or universities figured for the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the majority of their profession.
The main western political mantra, the re-election slogan of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", flew into a breakthrough in the UK's Brexit referendum.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
The Economic Character
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its last monthly questionnaire, gives the community answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened, because this time the voters made the decision on other than economic grounds.
One explanation for economists to the loss of the status of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant therefore.
If a immigrant gets a job, it is right away from the UK.
Many also have the idea that the decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The Economist’s opinion is that voters did not believe in economic arguments because the economic consensus was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were disgraceful by the BBC’s equality, which gave just a couple percent of the space to EU economists profiting from the dissolution than to the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power combinations about the consequences of the difference are.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, then they were not communicated, because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of the major cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas, the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy.
The Brexit referendum’s top winning argument concerned immigration.
The immigrant takes your workplace, the immigrant ruins your hospital, the immigrant uses it for you.
These arguments go.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health center there are immigrants.
How much easier would a British have medical periods if they were not?
There are immigrants in every school.
How much easier would true British children get a school place if they were released from them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the early residents have, if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
These apply to jobs, houses and public services.
However, the economists did not respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not get visible.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health services and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are net payers of the UK’s public economy and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen's Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are held by Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
The plan B for the winning of the EU disagreement camp was started to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote for the result of leave.
The worries were that investors began to withdraw their assets from the market.
Real Estate Funds normally do not have considerable liquid funds, but now they might be needed.
We went to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says Aberdeen’s only daily open, notorious real estate fund that the news touched.
The normal rate is 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund was at the time 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen on all the UK real estate funds open real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest cash amount in these funds remained to or even below 10 percent.
The real estate funds, therefore, prepared for Brexit for a very different strategy.
Funds Closed Trading
When the disagreement camp won, Europe was confused.
In the real estate market, however, the less than two weeks following the vote were quite quiet, Vanhanen says.
There were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of the CEO of the British Central Bank, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their transactions.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the case to the headquarters of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to the years 2007 and 2008, the Oldman says.
This caused investors to be nervous.
Institutional investors remained quieter, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and the foundation after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash assets collected, but he also eventually had to freeze his trading for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price to the bottom.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling the money out in panic.
The message of Aberdeen was that if you are not forced to take your money out, it is not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority canceled the announcement.
After that, it was fairly stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, the Old Man says.
He notes that, for example, there has not been any similar flooding in the Funds of the Continental Europe of Aberdeen.
However, there was a lot of queries.
Inappropriate attention to real estate funds
It is believed that the closure of the trade in real estate funds received unreasonably much attention.
The open funds covered by the closures control about four percent of the real estate in the UK.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 of its London properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may keep its fund closed for the end of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and the economic growth forecasts have been downward, but the situation does not look "lower" to Aberdeen.
The biggest concerns now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old Man notes.
The price of the pound and the dollar is the weakest in the past 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old says.
Brexit leads down to London Real Estate Market
At 2 p.m. the situation did not seem strange.
But in four, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power was in it.
I realized that this is now going on the side of plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV streams normally set out to be noise in the office infiltrated the news, and the normally noise people silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came in the morning before the camera to tell his divorce.
When the markets opened, the display ends blinked merely red.
It was a morning that he would never have believed to live, says the Old Man.
Not at all that despite the crowdfunding, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, ended a day after the Brexit referendum, i.e. two real estate transactions.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was somehow calm, the Old Man says.
Brexit voting begins reform
The vote was followed by a storm.
The punta collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to predict severe rates for the UK and the London real estate market.
London's offices were expected to get up to 20 percent down in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
The storm has gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
This is not the last day of his summer holidays this week in Helsinki.
I think it’s too early to say a lot about Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, about, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
Property service company CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
The prices of all London real estate fell 3.3 percent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, the mines amounted to 6.1 per cent, the Old Man lists.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and in only five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equal declines hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, however, that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began from the U.S. real estate market.
This is not the case, because it is now a crisis in Britain.
The feeling is another.
The real estate market now has not seen such a panic sales as at that time, but a desire to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Financing is normal as well.
It could have been corrected in any case.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him—this could have been before without Brexit as well.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of real estate in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We’ve been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last property class that is globalizing, the Old Man says.
The Middle East and Asia have become new operators on the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments from abroad.
London is known as a city of easy destination.
In addition, the prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has led to the fact that, for example, pension companies have been forced to look for profits from new items.
On this basis, the loan has been easily available - although the debt pain has been used now clearly less than during the 2008 crisis-precedent boom.
Decentralized, decentralized
In London, the price increased last summer, the Old Man said.
Aberdeen also began to relieve its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turning expected, and now it came.
What about this next?
It depends on how the British national economy develops, the Old Man says.
Much he doesn’t dare to evaluate the future, but he says that no rise is hardly allowed.
The mood indicates that there is a drop or stable go ahead.
He has seen more movements up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the crap can be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
They believe in global decentralization.
If you’ve invested in one market, there’s too much victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, the old says.
S-Group begins to register purchasing details more detailed
The S group will soon know what you eat, as the trade group announced today that it will begin to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its main customers.
As for now, the information has been collected on the end amount of the quota, the group will begin to disclose it from the purchased products in early May.
The S-Group is following this Centre, as the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Centre’s customer register for a couple of years.
Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, said the feedback from the program was mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used with permission for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to the Economy.
According to him, the Central Committee will not respond to the S-Group registration change.
The center will classify its fast customers in a group of ten according to just food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from the K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a position-customer program and there is no such in this set of plans.
The Finnish Near Trade has its own One-Bonus-Contact Customer Program, which can be joined in the Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting product or product group-level information, we are staying at the end sum level of the quota.
That is, we know where in the store the purchases were made and my day as well as the customer's quota of the final amount.
We have not gone to the level as the K group or the S group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the client program is intended to be reformed in the future, but the nearby store will tell you about it later.
However, it does not promise that the product information will be registered.
The first experiment
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
Basic information includes not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence and children’s births and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
On the S-Premium Card purchase is stored the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners is obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S markets, Prismo, Home Terras and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing can be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partnership operations at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored on the box in any case, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Tull's newest dog creation - the dog becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador boyfriend striking five similar boxes on line at the Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It doesn’t take a long time when it is determined to sit next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog by playing it with his favorite gameplay.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there were a blurry of smellful spots for food gas.
Fruit gas is the first smell that Heila has now been exercised, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trading
Heila is Tull’s first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vanta airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion, if necessary, to other border crossing sites and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
Attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in the Tull and the control has been strengthened after the attacks, says Tull superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training a weapon and explosive dog for the Tull's tasks are the postal shipping through Helsinki-Vanta.
As the internet trade has increased, up to 40 million mail ships are passed through the airport each year, including supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
Over the past few years, the customs authorities have made in the Helsinki-Vanta airport online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and aircraft, about 300 findings related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their originals.
Heila will work all over Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate registered luggage and postal shipping.
The ports of it will have a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the Heila, the Customs will evaluate whether further weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful for the idea.
School of Church
Heila-puppy education is coordinated by the Tull Dog School located in the Church.
Suntio is training with Heila also with the police and the Defence Forces experts.
Police have a strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Force has expertise in explosives.
The customs will decide in conjunction with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
We will always be trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vanda are Tull’s six narcotic dogs and money and narcotic dog Massi.
Heila Labrador has been chosen from the ten dog pets.
The criteria for choosing a dog to go to the airport include hunting and hunting, as well as tranquility, as the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
No one can get home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from a single hole.
Night-Sunnomien cameraman loses the camera's microprotection to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like protection immediately with the "going" command.
Hard competition for dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still levels tests ahead, next to October, which will assess whether education is sufficient for demanding job tasks.
Heilan will be able to see jobs in Helsinki-Vanda in the middle of next year if everything goes as planned.
Passengers, unfortunately, can’t come to silence the dog on the work sheets, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a working dog is approximately €60,000 to €70,000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work days will only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dog owners are a strong competition.
The owner of the Heila requested about 20-30 Tull employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has not previously had a working dog, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory tasks in Tull.
The Minival has their first Olympic wins – the people have a free day
The Fiji Olympics in Rugby, with less than a million inhabitants, are so high in the country that the government has determined August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fidji government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The holiday will be held the day after the team returns home.
The hosts are also allowed to celebrate in their homeland.
The Fiji Rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian that the final was followed in the country’s capital, Suva, where a screen was set on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fidžians are interested in rugby, but this game connected our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants the game was watched, I heard them encourage, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish director turned after a hurry performance

Threatening Modern Family Star Shows Again: Teen Star Shorts Discover Almost Everything
In the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter, who gets acquainted with Alex Dunphyna, is scared again by presenting a threat to his body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave a lot of imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also the back.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to much more courageous.
The star has poseed in the pictures she posted on social media in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very small shorts.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself during the celebration.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In that case, PowerwomenTV's founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the era of the Kardashians.
She has learned that the more she looks out of the open surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has stumbled some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It’s not difficult to guess where he’s going to be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans instead defend the actress and urge to be uninterested by criticism.
You look great!
It is the same what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, throwing a young woman.
Japanese people prefer from the north to Finland - tourists are attracted by the revontul: In autumn it is possible to see the sad mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start rebounds from the beginning of September, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main targets of the Japanese revolt tour are Inari and Levi.
The Revontulets are the water cards of our winter tour, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snow landscapes.
In Lapland, winter flights have a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn flights.
Rarely people know that the revontulisone begins early in the autumn and continues long until the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the revontulates making the look twice as famous, says Anne Lind, marketing manager at Visit Finland.
Visit the main target group of the Finland Revenge Campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already ready to be interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turin and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptional strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other northern countries.
The Japanese, however, needed more clear unique sights from Finland, and here the revontul has a huge potential according to Lind.
The number of Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly compared to other northern countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are interesting in terms of tourism in Finland, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is satisfied with the rugby championship course organized by FID
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed with Fidz's last challenge in the Thursday evening final when the team experienced 43-7 breakdown at the Deodoron stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged the championship course in handling, purses, scores, support games, running lines and silk in force when winning gold - their first Olympic matches.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable comfort for the silver medal - the third day of Britain - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby start tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier on the same day, the hard 7-5 victory of South Africa played in the semi-finals could bother them in the final.
Nevertheless, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
The UK may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: FID's chief coach is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.
The trip to the United Kingdom has been great.
Eight years ago, when Ryan was trained, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
They lost only one.
This rectum is painful, but the development is alarming.
Fidi started greatly resisting Britain's blocks for interest.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, it was as if they had shut down moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Colinisau dropped in a corner to the painting area.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown in the right line led to a painting blow.
12-0, and the United Kingdom had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant backdrop stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarak's third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fid.
In the seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored the goal in the right corner, and Britain was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa made the goal again on a new start, and the clock was still over a minute...for the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou went through the brilliant blocks of the United Kingdom and ran to the line to make a goal.
After the break, the situation was 29-0.
It seemed exactly as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning to play.
And that’s what it really is.
Great Britain made a break with numerous changes that blocked the FID pad for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until Josua Tuisova scored after the impressive FID input game.
Dan Norton scored the goal to the United Kingdom when he made the touchdown in the left corner and reduced the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders whose supporters sang, swallowed bills and danced in the sights.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi's ridiculous approach.
Mata Viliame last minute in her painting was a curvature in the Fid cake, which did not need curvature.
The piles were struck, the fidels shaken, and the United Kingdom fell into a hole, completely hit.
Earlier the same day, Fidi had hit Japan in the 20-5 semi-finals, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in the rigorous semi-finals, where both made one goal - the British match was resolved.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the painting area with stunning footwork and scored the painting under the columns in the second half.
The incredible late arrival of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-asside rugby team, guaranteed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
The Coach's Battle Against Cancer Fighted Helen Glover and Heather Stanning
In these matches there will be no more emotional gold, and it really means something.
From the first betting to the last, 220 hard kicks to the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found deeper significance from their golden moment at Estacio da Lago.
Coach Robin Williams' hole was present all the time when the twin jumped to the second consecutive Olympics in the women's pair competition - the first women in the British sports history books to overcome such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance unbeatable, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the surface of the pins with a slurry, does not completely illustrate the character of the victory.
On the background of each curve, there is a group of helpful hands-oners that gradually contribute to the things that are important. And no one hands-on was as important as a coach who didn't know 30 months ago after receiving the cancer diagnosis, whether he would live until this day.
As he said, the situation was stunning.
I had cervical cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don’t cut, it will spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate that his treatment was able to start in early 2014 outside the period, when they caused as little disorder as possible - if that expression can ever be used in such situations.
I had to get a salary, so I had to recover quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said that a few steps would be enough.
So it started.
Calling in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first pair of thoughts was Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Afghan command of the royal tickness, said: “I’ve had a tune this week, which may be a little overreaction, but that means so much for me.”
It just emphasizes how important this is for me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we’t be anything, so it’s a great thanks for him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition for five years.
The couple set a brave rhythm that their competitors did not overcome.
Even at the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen cries, “Stop in the process, stay in the process.”
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start and we did not try to do anything special at the same time.
We didn’t look for a lottery today, we just sought to win a good match and a race, and so we did.
The couple will wait a year before they decide their future.
Glover will take part in the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
He just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to exchange Panama government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are demanded by the wrath of the Panama data years demonstrators in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have turned off taxes through tax parishes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His followers, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is scheduled for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s recent anger will impact the autumn election outcome.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the rulers was clearly visible, and the president was elected by Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repealed his last discourse.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton participated in the organization's creation.
The Democratic Party was angry with the talks and asked for apologies from Trump.
As the army's chief should never let anyone who can fall around down, Clinton quoted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the burkini swimming clothes that cover Muslims’ favour, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
In the decision signed by Prime Minister David Lisnard, it is prohibited to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a good way and a swim dress that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming pools that greatly express religious connections may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist groups attacked a church in northern France and killed a 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming waters in the region of Oulu passed through the seil - in Pyykösjärv
The water samples taken from the official swimming plants of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for the swimming water.
Only on the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Environmental Action of the Oulu Region took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other public swimming shores located in the Oulu Region.
The concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria in all swimming pools, with the exception of the sea shore, were below the measures set by the Ministry of Social and Health Regulations.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcus were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had decreased below the operational range.
The blue lighting observed on the swimming pool of Pyykössee does not yet make the water swimless, but in favourable circumstances the situation can quickly become a blue lighting surface, forming a blue-green lighting mass on the water surface.
The environmental policy is monitoring the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue lighting becomes a blue lighting, it will also be separately on the swimming pool notification field.

MCC for the reduction of forest donations: More than 80 percent of forest owners are outside
The reduction of forest funds is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax discount, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generation exchange of forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest donations has four objectives: to promote the change of generations in forest spaces, to younger the age structure of forest owners, to increase the forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forest economy.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation change of forest spaces is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, the forest director of the Central Union of Farmers and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is critical for the tax change process.
Reduction of forest funds is made on the net capital income of the forest owner.
This is the capital income from which all other discounts have been removed.
MTK and Hakkaraisen believe the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales income of the wood.
The proposal is based on the fact that the reduction of the forestry net capital income will prevent the loss of the forestry capital income that should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if the tree was not sold.
The calculation is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner is unable to imagine it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model affects only a small portion of forest owners.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the income value of the forest is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It has been drawn too high to Hokkaido’s view.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are excluded.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership, he says.
In the VM, it is believed that the border guarantees the goal of the growth of the space.
In the forest policy, the reduction of forest donations has been trained for decades, according to Hakkaraisen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
The average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of the forest owners are retirees.
Strong railway storm surprised drivers in Himanga - two cars collided and collided
There was a special hostage on the Himalayas River on Friday morning.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive cars hit the side, after which there was a collision in the back.
The firefighter, Harri Pyyhti, said the fire was suspected to have been caused by a heavy rail.
There were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to the Fish River.
Research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers from the University of Åbo can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by the research group of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignity of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was able to prevent in laboratory conditions by restoring the tumor surrounding tissue to meet normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be able to improve by focusing on the treatment of cancer cells in addition to the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in cell biology.
The family murder of Muos continues in the court, the prosecutor calls for a murder sentence also to another criminal
The family murder of Muos continues in the court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family murder in Muhoks.
The other one received 8 years and 4 months, among other things, as a young man, for the murder and brutal robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and brutal robbery.
The convict was also sentenced to serious threat to road safety as a young person and to carry a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a young man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young man.
They were in full understanding.
According to the court, a 17-year-old boy killed a man who worked as a director of a school house child protection unit in July last year.
A 17-year-old man who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the sofa in the living room.
The director had been able to get out of the car and brought the young man into his room, where one of the young people hit him with a thumb.
The director was also, among other things, tortured by the leadership, shot and kicked into the head.
According to the investigation, both prisoners were fully understood at the time of the crime.
According to the law, the young people had planned a break from the family house at least since the previous day.
This is the world’s longest-lived backbone, it only grows at the age of 156.
The longest living spine in the world is a ice hole, a study published in the journal Science says.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice hole can live up to 400 years.
It grows only at the age of 156.
The life of the ice is increased by the fact that it grows only a centimeter per year.
Only one species is known to live the ice for longer.
The researchers discovered the age by radiochemistry.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive remains.
The researchers were able to assess the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years - though the throw in a direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as the Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need a different world.
Up to a third of all tax revenues in the country would be missing if Donald Trump's change to corporate tax was implemented.
The tax revenue would also decrease, especially with the wealthiest profitable tax discount.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35 percent to 15 percent.
It would be a huge amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest percentage of income tax is now 39.6, after Trump’s reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax will be dismissed.
Trump accused the state of overregulating the business and driving small into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards adopted by the fireworks must be renewed and the regulation on the energy sector must be repealed.
Barack Obama’s health reform needs to be taken into consideration.
The government must appoint “experts rather than bureaucrates.”
The “destructional” trade policy is, according to Trump, the main cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements will be withdrawn.
China will impose a 45% tax on imports and Mexico will impose a 35% tax on imports.
We offer a new future.
Americanity, not globalism, is our religion, Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world
American cars come to drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
Unlike his goals, Trump loyally read through the speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests stopped it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early on Friday.
The History of the Past - People's News
The sea blows fatally, but the real attack wave strikes in the middle of the street wave of Madrid - the accounting with the past can begin.
This is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s novel story.
Almodovar's previous director's Journeys (2013) was a little-thinking and snorkeling satire comedy, the previous Iho in which I live (2011) the Spanish tourist career tops.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between these two works.
It is a sovereign consistent love, human relationships and family framework, at the heart of which is the mother and daughter’s relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen long behind.
Life seems to be a model for the middle-age person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) must be in miracles until the movie's final meters.
In the form of a backbone and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
She starts from the time before the daughter’s birth, the moment when she met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist is Adraina Ugarte, presenting Julieta as a young teacher from the TV series The Time Between the Omels (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been treated in a way that can be considered a crack, but I would say myself that it is quite hard and literally with a repeat.
For Almodóvar movies often so characteristic of humour, even in Juliet there is a fair distance.
It’s a fairly performed, humiliated, place in place with good music and a pretty sad movie with such elements of elegance.
Instead, the typical visual colorability for the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to put a little silence into the eye more as a pure fashion style than as an active dramatic effect.
The people of the film are experienced by diseases, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same coral.
This is especially true for clothing: in the case of the name person, the habitat varies from scene to scene, and the same applies to appearance replacement.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the currents of this scene, are not improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script on the basis of three novels by the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded Canadian Alice Munro.
The novel was published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally uncomparable to a thinner drama, so much big things – especially the shining guilt – the leff’s theme is dealt with.
Directed by: Pedro Almodóvar.
It is based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Actors: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie is 12.8.
The Government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be done, the ministers call to ensure that the Flanders do not collapse entirely.
However, the operations decided in the spring will be carried out on the rope trade.
There will be no new cuts.
The $4 billion savings are sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (central) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, as the cuts on social security were decided already in the spring framework.
Children’s pension, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 percent.
The period of unemployment insurance is shortened from 500 days to 400.
Training interruptions continue.
The municipalities are scared
Why are the ministers so strongly emphasizing that there are no new cuts on them?
The next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter of the election period, not the gallups.
It has previously been seen that the municipal outcome of the government parties in different directions will ruin the government’s mood for a long time.
However, the Gallup reports that the government party of the Northern Finns is expecting a rough deficit, although its previous elections resulted in modest 12.3 percent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Flanders received 752 new delegates, a large part of which will be realised in the next spring the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The life line of the government of three approximately equally large parties is in the midst of the fact that the front of the Flanders will be sustained.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters got enough of the government’s policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
There will be no new cuts—the rhetoric, first of all, confuses the fact that the next year they will be done rigorously and, second of all, attempts to soften the Persian strike.
Great cuts in 2018?
Within a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Siberian government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of reducing debt during this election period, but in the budget proposal of Petteri Orpo the debt will be taken next year by EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands up in the middle of the election period and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: the debt is unlikely and even slowed down.
The second is to keep up with the program.
This means new, even harder cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be rounded at least close to the balance during the year 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what will come.
This means that the debt is not
It’s quite clear that the current actions of debt don’t seem, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to get a positive mood.
The quarters presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the budget intelligence ceremony testify unreasonably:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven universityist, meaning there is no petition on the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has not just risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except for the period of the recovery policy carried out in the early 2010s.
The unemployment rate has increased by 35 per cent over the last decade and extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs now three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The public debt, which exceeded the 60 percent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 percent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the left union’s debt withdrawal was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which is practically covered by taking a completely new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the assembly, and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks.
Three out of four believe that the organization of children’s daycare, youth work and exercise belong to the municipal responsibility, according to a study by the KAKS – Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people assign responsibility to the individual municipality, including libraries, culture, citizen schools, building control, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the countryside, in turn, is most clearly desired by the countryside targeting, special care, professional education, vocational schools and institutional care for developing disabled people.
None of the municipal responsibilities are to be transferred to the state.
Minor rider rushed after the police flew
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver flew from the police station in Joensu in Ilomantsinti on Friday at half a hour.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without light, but the young man went to drive the police to escape at fair high speed.
The back journey continued to the Sonkajan Range, from which it continued to the Sorronhaunt and to the smaller forest path where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
Even after that, the young man escaped, but a faster police ran to the carrier.
The driver's shooting test showed a 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driving license that would be permitted to drive a motorcycle.
The incident is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The roof in the stone fell down.
The stone that was in the stone crashed on the side of the Polvijärv in Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The river had moved to the left in a bump out of the road and fell to the side of it.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed trail through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first careers.
The lifting of the car remains the car owner’s task.
From the crashed trail, a hydraulic oil was thrown on the road which the rescue facility absorbed into the turf.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the airport in the southern part of the country.
The police are searching for a 165 cm long, thin and cool woman with white hair stretching under the leaf.
Notices and clues about missing movements are requested to call the Nordic State Center at the point number 0295440513.
Materials of Great Accident in the Air - see the image gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The crash of the Parafest festival tents caused considerable damage.
The chairman of the Joensuun Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be financed, and the event can also be held next year.
The Parafest's last show, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the end of the Friday evening at the torrents.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the performances held in the premises of the City Theatre starting at 13 p.m.
The art center in Ahjossa is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is scheduled.
Flood flow occurs in the cloud when rain water and its weight trigger the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the condition of the water in the outskirts binding the heat, and thus the falling air is cooled and its speed towards the ground is accelerated.
According to the Meteorological Institute, floods occur in Finland over several years during the summer.
The routes of flooding are difficult to predict.
A shutdown strike hit the Joensuu Art Museum in Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5 a.m.
Three tents were destroyed, with a total of about 200 people in the tent.
Four people suffered mild injuries in the accident.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a mild injury to subsequent treatment.
Air pollution ages in London
The study found that the skin in London is aging faster than usual.
The cause of ageing is air pollution.
The study was published by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retirees in London have a skin two and a half years older than a rural partner.
The skin aging small particles are a very fine dust pollutant, which is derived from transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kills 9,500 London people each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to pass through the deepest layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk especially for those in London who go on their work trip walking near stunning streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is recommended to regularly clean the skin.
Traktor brakes cheated, man standing in front
The man had moved stones in a tractor.
When he had climbed out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor’s brakes were deceived and the tractor struck the man.
The man did not stay under it, but the tractor captured the dead man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigations as he was seriously injured.
The tractor did not go further, because it collided with the stones in front.
We have new strength for the next season.
The river player Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Champions League, starts a series that starts in October with better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been in the box for three weeks.
The common tone is found with better certainty than in the previous seasons, when the series' fields have been dark for Riennol.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's chief coach, promotes a new team to be effortless and united.

Garchet is a passar, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
Josban, Katajan and Jokipoiki to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now there are already sixth matches in Tampere, only 2013 was between Canada becoming better in the North American matches.
I was working on the Market and playing with women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was creating a national team.
I was interested in it and this is what we are now, says Jumppane, 48.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensu, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataya and later Jokipojis hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the salibandy SM series of the season 1991-92, the following three passes run in Josbas.
In addition to playing, he prepared the group A girls to the championship.
The female SM series climbed to the silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played women in the SM series 10 through, the balance was accumulated in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Tatu Väänänen and Perttu Puska were named in the country team
The river salibandiseur Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the enolais-based Tatu Väänänen was elected to the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's countryside matches, where he has earned a total score of 9+4=13.
Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defendant, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a row and is part of the national team’s standard board with 117 land matches experience.
The country team was also named Mika Kohonen, a concari player from the Seinäjoen Playliers, who was first seen in Finland in the last December World Cup.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is the counter player Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasun's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold lacks from the prize box
Essi Hasu will stop as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the last season.
The beach volleyball Finnish championships will be held in the weekend at the Kouvolan Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the SM final tournament organized by the Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Airball Federation, the six best pairs of each series are qualified.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s grown Essi Hasu, who has been part of the top of Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will visit this weekend.
There will be a great arena for the baseball.
I’m not playing in the adult series very often in Kouvolah, so it’s great to play in the finals at home, Hasu felt.
The Kouvolan countryside burned Hasu's pipe into the sport and gave good feeds to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started the ball at the age of 9 in the NMKY's E-girl.
The top is the mind of a too big game tape, the knees that roll in the nails, as well as the brilliant axis and choreographs after the point, Hasu reminds.
At a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team created an environment where it was comfortable to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the team friend's father prepared us and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in the youth’s age a natural sort choice as the counterweight of the interior ball.
The swimming pool has been playing bikes since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I was also going to watch the Junior SM Tour’s shares, thinking that one day I’d be playing there myself.
Now this dream is realised when Hasu plays the weekend together with the scratched Anniina Parkkisen in the SM finals.
The goal of Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde in the second round of the tournament is clear.
The realist goal is a medal.
SM gold is still lacking in the prize box, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend appearance in Kouvol may be the last known to Hasulle in front of the audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in the field of civility.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, backbags are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The air strike collapsed the tents during a disabled event in Joensu, the major accident was near

Solomon Koli is boldly becoming a farmer.
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, harshness and rigidity.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started shortly two years ago, together with his little brother Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their home status.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brother through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and expansion in the field so that bread could come to the hand from agriculture.
This has been my story since childhood.
I’ve always pleased with the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013 we went on to build a park and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
However, I went myself really boldly into the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that it would not have been taken if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would turn to good.
Solomon Coli, who grows meat cars, is aimed at investing in a larger branch.
The work has produced results as Solomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers of the Rural Future magazine.
He is competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the newspaper’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in the years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero since October last year, with a positive 0.2%.
The average annual inflation, measured by the living cost index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (February 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (February 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the living cost index was 101,0% compared to June 2016, meaning the monthly inflation rate was 1,0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0,2%, compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the prices of the following consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), mixed goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2,2 %), furniture, household accessories and routine maintenance (0,5 %), health (0,1 %).
The prices remained at the same level as last month in terms of alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat’s “anime” effect is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to edit reality and play identities in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into ananas, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face-release tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie per day.
All errors will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized by the accusation that the app advertises a blackface or “black” mask or favors whitening skin as a beauty issue.
So as Snapchat announced this week to some users a lens that gave them wicked eyes, wicked teeth, and bull pockets, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people - “geltanaam” or yellowface.
And they wondered whether these repeated controversies could be a sign of the company’s greater diversity problem.
News and anger spread broad on Wednesday with reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had terminated the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended for an honor to animated characters, not a cartoon of Asian people.
But for racism-experienced observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly banned the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was widely shared, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that “it’s difficult to argue against a comparison that includes side-side crashing Asian caricature and filter effects.”
It shows that the filter is not just a celtanam, but a celtanam with extreme degrading.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural interests.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and to the equipment we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s enormous, racially diversified youth audience may mean that they are even more likely to wait for a understandable attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an insulting image, “these guys are much more difficult than ever to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racist disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s wage practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly white men's leadership and decided to write with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
“Of they do not have a variety of representations of different skin colors in their staff, so they are able to make such decisions,” Chinese-American Zhu said, “or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in stations where they feel safe or can speak directly.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely left no response.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff by pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss its staff about racism, but the representative said the company recently hired the recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and move forward internal inclusion attempts.
In his contribution, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed by adding: “It’s so that they actually need more users like us to say that this isn’t ok.”
Congress panel says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence data
In a Thursday-published report, the Congress panel said authorities from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces military area, editing intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than the events on the site justified.
The Republican President, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defence Fund Committee’s working group’s part-year survey report found “a widespread dissatisfaction” among the headquarters’ intelligence analysts who said the heads disrupted their estimates of the U.S. efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Military Area in Florida, Tampere, which oversee U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outcomes approved by the senior leaders of the Centcom typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than what the facts occurred on the site justified. They were regularly more positive than the analysis produced by other factors in the intelligence community,” the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision makers,” said representative Ken Calvert, the Republican of California, said.
The failures of the management of Centcom rise to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the descriptions and analysis of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking governments of the Obama administration had ordered the reports to be disguised, it depicts analysts feeling how the leaders of the Centcom would have put pressure on them to describe the threat caused by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates for Congress were much more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For instance, the authority of the Centcom publicly stated that a major attack to recover Mosul could begin even so early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in control of ISIS.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces Military District headquarters manipulated the headquarters intelligence outcomes in order to reduce the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence information about the Islamic State.
The report, which was published on Thursday, follows more extensive results as the study is ongoing.
The Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Defense has begun an additional, ongoing investigation of the Centcom intelligence.
The Democratic members of the Chamber of Representatives Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican Working Group.
“Thro the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an inexorably isolated process from the intelligence evaluation of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead Democrat of the committee, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process “extended the publication of intelligence products”, deteriorated the mood among analysts and did not “give enough space for different perspectives.”
Schiff and the Democrats said they didn’t find any evidence that the White House had tried to press Centcom’s analysts to match their conclusion “with a predetermined or political story.”
The Daily Beast reports on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congress’s investigation.
Last August, The New York Times that the Pentagon superintendent has started the investigation after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, the representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on Congress's report as long as the investigation of the supervisor is ongoing.
But he said that “experts are sometimes disagreed about the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.”
The investigation has other follow-up consequences, except in the question of whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as an increasing number of defence officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to deliver honest assessments of war actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The Islamic State intelligence review reflects more than a decade of controversy when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote an investigation article in which it was said that despite the objections of several analysts, the President George W. Bush administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding the Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the attacks against the Islamic State-controlled refineries did not significantly deteriorate the terrorist group’s economy as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the Black Stock Exchange.
The Times in September that this discovery was not outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate as a overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
For the fourth time in a row, the U.S. will win a female massacre with Britain.
The day after he had made three goals in a team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made the first two goals in the U.S. women's land hockey team winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
“I don’t have any idea,” he said.
“I’m not a person who keeps a book of his paintings.”
But this is what he knows: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unsuccessful after defeating Japan on Thursday 2-0.
The United States and Britain will meet on Saturday in the first round of the game.
Both teams have survived the quarter, and this game decides who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams in their group.
The first place is to avoid a strong Dutch, the second group leader, a little longer at the beginning of the quarterfinals.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, the Americans have woke up with their surprising success here, four years after they stayed at the London Olympics for the last of 12 teams.
I was in that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the land hockey field in his hands for the first time at the age of 3 (his parents and two brothers played the race in Drexel) joining the land team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not enter the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his team members.
The following year, the English Craig Parnham was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
“Culture change, spiritual change, physical change,” Bam said.
We did not have the same working hours in London as we have now.
We have made a complete translation.
On Thursday afternoon, Bam began the first half of the game with a crossroads near the painting.
India had come into the air with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation in 1-0 reading until the end of the third part, when Bam took the situation over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then scratched to the middle and scratched the ball into the balls leading the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth set.
This zero game was the first tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He is in good direction.
This is the same as Bam.
“We’re in a good situation now,” Parnham said, but his goodness depends on the end of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline Peace in the Olympic Centre
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are ongoing.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable, angry by the message of competition and effort.
It’s like the Olympic sport itself would be a lightweight message that is transmitted from the shooter to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It’s impossible to put on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a guest friend’s conversation in the cafe line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledeck, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first and future Olympic heart attacker with a smile-up, could well be one of the well-known names that are presented at the best time of viewing and supported by sponsorship contracts and good-mind TV ads - if he was a swimmer, an athlete, or even a swimmer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic hole does not illuminate all species as much.
Longer than the center, partially in the shadow, are the species that are not all generally accepted: airpistol, riding, ball, taekwondo.
We always have breastfeeding, as long as it lasts.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special ingredients, I would like to pay attention to the humbled charm of trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, its presence has been between in the past 16 years to be taken into account so little that many who I interviewed did not realize at all that it was an Olympic species.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the genre, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not advanced to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
However, trampoline is accompanied by a certain kind of subjective charm, partly because it sounds better suited to the non-civilized ear than to the clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to acknowledge that I am not an expert, I am just an aircraft fan.
The species have the possibilities of fun, as observed in the color of the endless pumps of the drawing films, but it also has the smoothness of the gym and the swimming pool, two species that in that principle combine.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word “el trampoline” which means “pumpboard”.
The winners of the championship jump on a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet high, and they have to perform cheerful business lines (translations, talents and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be evaluated on the basis of performance, difficulty and “flight time”.
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common way of the Olympics is straight forward.
Those who wish for a medal have to go for gold in search of further, faster, up and above - sometimes up to paint, sometimes forward around the field.
They don’t just hunt a painting or a starting wall, but also, in television news, another scattering boundary: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is thin, admireable and even fanatic - and it can even get to the tears of the spectator.
But that’s also the reason why watching the games can be a bit upset.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest.
The trampoline is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor climbs to a new rise, appearing as weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then hardly again up.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no angry climbing to the end, no jumping to the distance, only the time and gravity of the sleepy, slurry interruption.
It’s as close to the Zen state as you can get at the Olympics.
Women's cartridges and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon when the broadcast starts at 13 (ET), men's matches will be held on Saturday at 13 (ET).
NBC will broadcast the final as part of its afternoon software starting at 14 a.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympics, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be viewed and objectivized (as U.S. male athletes some time ago suggested according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a shocking new fan team.
“Generation shows minds” in Ethiopia, a long-term US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced the government’s violent opposition.
Observators say dozens of protesters were shot dead in the strikes with the police.
Is Ethiopia broken?
Over the last decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western ally, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it is spreading to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people walked to the streets calling for a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was unreasonable.
The observers said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Distributed, recorded videos of the protests, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security authorities shoot young people while they were forced to stand with their hands on the wall.
The United Nations Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“To keep this country together has always been difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, who is the project manager of the African Corner in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved greatly, and the capital Addis Abeba has even a new train for work travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Human rights organizations have constantly talked about government oppression, the country’s opposition has been limited, and interdependents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But this may be changing.
“If you’re suppressing people and they don’t have any other option than to show their minds, that’s what will happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is mindful.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover all of the land use coalition's power's disciplinary product.
After a lot of criticized elections last year, the ruling party to its allies got the last place held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are growing. The struggle on this narrow and controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, may try to use the gun for the benefit and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of heating under the surface, angry emotions are now exploding.
The first one seems seemingly dangerous: smartphones.
Only in the last few years a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, with cheaper smartphones being generalized and the internet service improved.
Although the government would block access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate the location through the hidden network brokers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the oroms and the amharats, are better dealing with each other.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amhars, who come mainly from the Christians of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business, using forths, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the suburbs.
But this is changing too.
“We’re on the way to organize under one shadow,” said Mulatu Gemechu, chief executive.
The major protests have occurred in the Amhar and Orom regions.
Many amhares and oroms think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the tiger people belonging. The people cover about six percent of the population and dominate the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the discomfort is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, the former leader of the rebels, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died from a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical neron, a man who saw the corners around.
Analysts say he was qualified to detect early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“The current government has no such basic insight,” conflict analyst Abdi said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was appointed as relatively unknown to fill Meles' socks.
Unlike Meles, which was from the northern Ethiopian Tiger area, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the tigers do not trust him.
Many are afraid that this can lead to increased bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia was in power in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds of the elections, which analysts say seemed that the government was first hunted and then stealing them.
In the follow-up, many protesters died, though less than in the last months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new work trains, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the internal intensification of the denial of the Ethiopian government.
And now it begins to become a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the anti-tiger hatred is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in the position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a support point for aircraft flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said some time ago it had closed this support base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their unstable allies in the region to collapse.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a real balance.”
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based ISIS claims as “radical”
Donald J. Trump attempted to suppress his last campaign, dominating the controversy on Friday, saying he was not serious when he repeatedly said this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founder” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The survey raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have surfaced to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain comments that he may not necessarily mean.
Following the indication made at the Wednesday evening campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same more and more enthusiasticly on Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was really to say that President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just a sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews he was really serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio speaker Hugh Hewitt sought to help Trump disclose his comment by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican president candidate took it to his hearing ears.
The last storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign in the middle of the outcomes of opinion research.
Trump and Clinton talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the issue.
Escaping again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump has previously used the sarcasm.
Late in July, after he faced widely widespread criticism in proposing that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying, "I'm surely sarcastic."
The approach will allow Trump to go through the boundaries of political speech and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he’s testing certain messages that are important to his fans. He’s looking at how they work and then ‘explain’ the direction or the other depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has tracked the use of the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he’s lazy about his statements and knows that they’re insignificant enough to filter them through a number of different lenses.
Instead of relieving his speeches for a large voting crowd, Trump has been even more safer in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new, Friday-published NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey revealed that Trump has trapped Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the cycle is strict in Florida.
Although Trump is generally trying to avoid apologies for provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding of his words or misunderstanding of his humor.
As he faces an increasingly closer review over the past few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his faithful allies to an uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him regardless of how provocative his comments are.
New York's former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, saw a lot of effort in defending the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think his words have real, political comments,” Giuliani said when asked about the authenticity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most sovereign Republicans try to argue that Obama’s government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on news media that crack him every word and are partial against him.
He scratched “bad, foolish” television experts trying to make him clear by saying, “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats scratched Trump's excuse as a new proof that he is an inappropriate president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpointi
Verb Cafe was a crowded, only cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, with no wireless network but offering good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the Bedford Avenue street bar was too expensive for it.
The business, which replaced Verbin in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells copper-shaped soap.
The local people shaken it as the last loss in the middle-class renovated city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I can’t still believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is melted and Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened in November last year in Greenpointi, less than a mile away from its original location.
In the new Verb there is wifi and there can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unfinished atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and chief executive of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the customer was offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of things left behind.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espressor.
It even used the light of the Old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
In the dining store you can find pekon-cannabis cheese snacks, and the coatings are available for example, caprice and roasted seeds.
There is brown rice.
There is no more beer in the coffee shop, but there are fresh juices.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a stable stream of old loading customers.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers,” he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpointi, he walked to the cafe.
He says that after the closure of Verbin, he gave up coffee for a moment.
“I understood that I Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now she has returned to the coffee pair, although that day she ordered a mixed chai drink instead of her ordinary ice cream, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went there before working and always made the same order.
“Every day from fifteen to seven, regularly as the hour, I went in and they were preparing spices with my bagel butter,” she said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the diet.
Today, Rosenthal still makes its ordinary order, but sometimes, because of a variation, it spaces a spicy bagel with a pekon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn’t bear beauty to the soap store that took over the old buildings.
In fact, Soap Cher's owners were offered to make a special Sapphire for Verb, which would be used as a ingredient for coffee coated coffee.
“I think we can still take the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the coffee.
One of these new customers turned from a meal to Poland, and Rodriguez said he planned to put it out soon at some point in order to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice wants to bottle and sell refrigerated coffee.
It is possible that the cafe extends to the nearby building.
For many customers, it is enough that they get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a host and said he was unhealthy when the site was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
“I’ve got to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Floating Food of the Sheep Age
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
As a flavor, President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as the refiner, and Maryland’s sweets.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in a tomato bottle, potato piece and dessert from a bone marrow.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity to people suffering,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's last book, Chop Suey, talked about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman talked about life from the Lower East Side floorroom through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is a historian of American food during the 1930s’s great milestone.
Showing some kind of their own culinary solidarity, they meet the reporter at the Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a small, unfinished dining bar in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese-olive, and Coe, 57, took the dose with calcium, potato and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat pack, the couple thought it was suitable to discuss the breeding season.
“The routes were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was a pineapple, a pineapple, a pineapple, a pineapple.
They were made from a manufacturing material and some cheap ingredient, which continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine you eat so much potatoes that they will form your dining.
Coe is Irvine.
“It’s definitely felt like it’s thick in the stomach,” he said.
Years before the layer age, the American table, especially on the countryside, was like a food-in-many-to-the-country-down table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh dishes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. The book A Square Meal chronicles the ways the nation survived that it suddenly was no longer a country of overwhelming.
“At that time, food became a key, annoying topic for Americans,” Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the same annoying was a new, cheap diet: Mysterious foods, such as cakes and boxes, became the main foods, and the boxes were “a huge way to use food sources,” Ziegelman said, because the cakes were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the cream boxes.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which has been in the center of American food for years, became a savings-saving luxury product.
Special compounds were tested with calorie and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
During its research also for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an epoch's dish in which fried chips were filled with potatoes.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “It was unrealistic.”
In any case, the grapefruit is not suitable for strawberries.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s food methods more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and journals, they encouraged women to become “budgeters” and respond to the challenge of turning spaghetti and carrots like spaghetti into delicious doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavours.
Particularly delicious are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let Me Eat a Cake" attitude.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood’s simple, iowal land food, he ate like a refined millionaire who had become him.
“He liked continental food like a fish on a throat,” Coe said.
She ate a smoking in a almost golden dining room.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, would have encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who had no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that “provided not only the Washington’s most expensive, but also the worst-made food.”
Many of the Lamanic foods were abandoned as soon as the earth returned to its feet.
Heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating methods, for example, how she couldn't throw out food.
“He really was afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “He even sicked people.”
There was a windfall.
After the tables were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe drawn up the dessert they had prepared at home: the sheep bread that President Roosevelt eaten for lunch.
“It’s called bone marrow,” Ziegelman added, adding that the general trick was to give the modest recipes a look like a name.
There was no cream shell in the afternoon, only cabbage, a little powder, sugar, water and cannella.
Everyone wrapped their teaspoons unwantedly in their smooth, brown sheet.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe swallowed once and again.
He heard of a positive budgetary, and told his wife, “A little cracked German nuts could help.”
Gilead will be replaced by lawyers in the patent fight against hepatitis C against Merck
The U.S. marriage judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to obtain the lawyer fees caused by it in a dispute against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc. for a hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million payments after they violated two Merck’s patents associated with Gilead’s successful drugs for Sovaldi and Harvon. This release followed when a U.S. judge found Merck’s abuses including false valle and other unethical practices.
In a judgment on Thursday, U.S. married judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be exempt from the compensation brought to him in the case of appeal.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can clearly heal more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case starts in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other for the ownership of a laboratory work based on Gilead’s drug active substance sofosbuvir.
U.S. supported troops say they have fully conquered Manbij under ISIS control.
U.S.-backed troops have fully conquered the city of Manbij north near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last battle group hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 flagship prisoners, which the fighters considered prisoners, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Allied Force, the Manbij Military Council, Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we have started to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the Democratic candidate and her husband's revenue in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million for speech remunerations, and former Foreign Minister announced that he received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book, in which he told his career in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's vice-president candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10 year tax declarations.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are putting a measure for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and rejecting his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
The U.S. presidential candidates will usually publish their tax declaration, even if the law does not require it.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration’s audit due to the refusal to publish tax statements.
“It’s your turn,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax declarations.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he will not allow Trump to publish them until audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other bonds, for example, with Russia.
Clinton has been hit by the problem in a video posted on Friday, showing visible Republicans calling on Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every president candidate in the past decades has done: published his tax declaration,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes for two in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist borrowed on Friday numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rate has become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton’s meeting in Nebraska’s Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax statements.
Buffett said he’s also undergoing a tax administration inspection, and that Trump doesn’t “fear” the tax collection agency, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax declarations until 2007.
Currently, the actual federal tax rate for Clinton living in Chappaqu, New York was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a cheap, index-binded investment fund, and Clinton $109,000 in dividends and interest revenues.

Chili condoms and elephants enhance the protection of the elephant in Tanzania
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The tool has proven to be effective, and the idea, invented several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, in collaboration with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in northern Tanzania villages to use the unviolent four-step way in protecting homes and hundreds without hurting animals.
In the past, many people used to protect themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...tools, we have noticed a change in attitude in these communities. they are now much more confident in keeping the elephants out of their shelf without damaging them,” Honeyguide’s CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include the indication of the penetrating elephant with the pocket lamp and the calling of the torch.
If it does not prevent the animal, then the so-called “chilippe” is thrown.
The preservative is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, as well as electrical, and then the preservative is rounded up so that only the lighting plate remains visible.
When the preservative is burned, it breaks down and blows chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate means is the shooter, which shines the air of a Roman candle. The lightning produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli tour number on request of Arabs
A French Jewish filmmaker overcome the media storm after it was revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin doesn’t list Israel’s route number.
The director of the Shoah documentary, Claude Lanzmann, revealed his frustration at the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find a list of countries offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the states to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and removed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call to Israel through its own telephone center.
When looking for the explanation, the filmmaker took the matter as a speech at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer received from there “shocked him.”
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “a considered decision by the Kempinski hotel management.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more turmoil in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli route number,” the employee said.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case “a huge injustice,” Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
“We were scared and shocked by the incident.
It is a great injustice in itself.
But even more shameful is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This does not require any explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a resistance on the internet when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply “admitted” to the alleged claims of Arab customers.
“Let’s go,” it was said in another publication, noting that the hotel located on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm Street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the accusations and called the incident “incertitude” and “forgiveness” from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“A clear order not to include Israel in the list of immediate elections has never been made,” Kempinski’s representative said, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number is now added.
Police use tears and rubber products against Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to demonstrate their minds against the government’s public education system reforms.
The police used tears and rubber products against the protesters.
The problems began when the lawmakers tried to break down the student squad, leading to the police using rubber products and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their horror over the plans.
The governor of Sao Paulo, Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, said the proposals would close a little less than 100 public schools, and 300,000 students would be re-invested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president Michel Temer.
This last demonstration took place just days after the protesters took part as a crowd to support the arrested President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted for his appeal.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran grows by 71 percent
After the removal of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 percent compared to the previous year, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
After the international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have shown their interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies will continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Naturally, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period of 2015, with a total of $856 million.
Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to a total of $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
“Commerce growth was achieved by the supply of machines, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Affairs Agency in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to the citizens of Iran, mainly for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the 20 countries with the most tourist visits in Russia.
“It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
Scotch Callum Skinner dropped in the painting when the British hit a bicycle ride
Scotland's Callum Skinner fought his honor in the men's teamprint at Rion's bicycle stadium last night when the British team's triangle defended his 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was recovered, the legend was proud of the young man when he plunged into the painting by attacking the victory predecessor of the New Zealand team.
Britain won a shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic goals.
And they repeated the trick after placing the modest sixth in the March race World Championship in London, although Hoy has since decided his competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of special messenger Jamie Staff.
This was achieved just in the time when Hindes appeared.
The end of the treatment also created the vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom the British coaches held up in the face of Scotland’s potential that is now perceived.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hey four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in time times, but New Zealand led the leadership in the first round.
And the British triangle won a double battle for gold.
Hindes was very behind after his own round, but Kenny put the team in leadership, and Skinner kept it.
The strategic change was a major part of the transformation, and it included the drive of Hindes with a larger shift to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and attracted the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed the prize.
The 23-year-old Glasgow-like Skinner said, “The fight is stunning.”
I am here to do my best and gain reputation.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible at once.
There is no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later pulled his comment back, and the British competitors did not complain.
There was no similar problem this time with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, “I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flights on the foot.”
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of a total of ten types of cycling both in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are waiting for a successful five days on a bicycle stadium.
Based on Kenny's status, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's sport, winning three Olympic balls in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (at that time apparently a holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoylla.
Kenny competes next in the sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
We win it together with friends.
Winning alone is, honestly, lonely.”
Hindes said, “If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the rider’s value.”
This was the day’s only medal competition, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest ever in a four-mile, four-kilometre team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 gold record in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the hour when officials called him to the length measurement.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advance in the World Records at the time of the hour stop at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its powerful rally team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole set of medals.
Presented in Beijing and London with a truly exceptional and complete management, expectations have been reduced before the Rion matches.
The background has been a drama, the least of which has not been the difference of the technical manager, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptations, as well as the end of the competition of great figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first evening races on the bicycle stadium, however, it seems that the legendary reputation of Britain now rising to its peak at the perfect moment could be held true again.
Portland's untouchable future is questionable due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria's aluminum plant, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distributor to the factory revealed that one of the factory owners is concluding a distribution agreement, so it is expected that all distribution agreements will be cut.
The measure follows the decision taken by the Victoria administration earlier this year that the support required for the maintenance of the factory will not be extended.
The 20 year period of support expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger at Alcoan Portland factory.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the slurry uses approximately 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's foam, which led to the closure of the Anglesean power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland slurry loses money and is under the risk of closure.
The measure follows a number of years of speculation about the factory’s future, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been caused by the factory’s production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to conclude its contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoan and Alumina Association, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL is expecting the operation of the Portland factory to continue, which means that the immovable physical need for electricity will continue,” she said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called “protection agreements” which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to produce results in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
All potential outcomes for AGL from the financial year 2018 to the next are currently limited by the strong prospects for the future market for gross prices of electricity.
AGL said it has already “defined forecasts” lowered the value of contracts in its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts “do not affect Alcoan’s ability to keep the melt in operation or to ensure unmelted electricity.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been cautious for the possible closure of both the Portland-based and Tomagon-based factory near Newcastle due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Last week, AGL’s executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If both factories leave the market, there is a significant decline in the demand for [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just the real TV star of the Kardashians, will be on the side of Vogue in September
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter of the clan, is in the U.S. Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and has been a model for the Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
“Seeing this cover in a room full of loving people made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The announcement was followed by a characteristic (or maybe just the Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favourite story, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's suit, but that ended with a classic turn: they also planned a surprise party.
It’s a cliché picture of almost every child’s television series’ “birthday period” (Seacrest says the cliché “you didn’t think we’d forget you” with the credibility of the morning-covered pupuchus), but Krisin had to make other daughters somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we’ve surely moved to the new Kardashian era with the Vogue place in September.
Kendall's grandmother Kim may first reach Vogu's appeal (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the newspaper's September number is quite his own class.
The Voguen September number is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles a coffee protocol more than a fashion sheet, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page guidelines last year had advertising content).
The publication of the newspapers is so anticipated that over the past two years the photographs of the newspaper have flooded before the official publication.
Former women included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has actually been more “pronunciations that act as models” than “pronunciations that are famous.”
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on board in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary place.
But if it happened that Jenner, which the newspaper describes his generation as a “success model”, would first enter that category, he’s in a pretty good companion.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are reasonably talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s national model, Beyoncé, has been one of the strongest years of its career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
In his real TV history, Jenner's role in the fashion world will always be a substrate.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the mom of this moment.”
This feeling rose again to the surface with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But turning in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on Vogu's September number.
He is a supermodel in the clearest sense of the word.
He is a model for Marc Jacobs.
He sells you the makeup of Estee Lauder.
She and all of her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own, payment wall guaranteed apps.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took to the LOVE newspaper.
And in her free time, just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she’s a real TV star.
Community legal centers displace 160,000 people annually
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are dismissed from the legal centres of the Community, as the sector is preparing for the effects of the additional financing cuts, as it is already prepared for its activities at the extreme.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the possibility of fighting unfair assassinations and the equivalent - are already turned away in their search for explicit legal advice and representation.
The legal services already extended to the Community are preparing for additional cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, the head of the Queensland Community Legal Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centers accounting report, thousands of people are already displaced every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not revoked, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland community legal centers are chronically underfinanced, meaning that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and rampant debts, apart families, unfairly dismissed workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We ask the Minister of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brandis that they immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the financing of legal aid to the national average level.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Center and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged after a worker was claimed to be threatened with a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged by the court for allegedly failing to do anything after they were told that the campaign’s North Carolina operating chief threatened a worker with weapons in February while driving them on the Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit brought by former software manager of the state campaign Vincent Bordin on Wednesday at the Charlottes State Court.
Bordini said he was waiting for months for the situation to be addressed internally before he realized that “this should not happen.”
The captain Earl Phillip “dealt out the pistol, placed his right front arm on the slope and pushed the stick against Vincent’s kneeling,” Bordini said in the appeal.
Unfortunately, after the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had similar experiences with Philip.
“We don’t need to shoot weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said in the appeal.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused frustration by telling the public in North Carolina that “the people of the second increase” – which generally includes weapons owners and armed forces – could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was complained and had to choose judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his word out of the context and that he was not in favor of violence.
In the challenge of Bordin, the campaign will be charged with compensation for negligent surveillance and Philip for violence, abuse and emotional harassment.
Trump’s representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request.
The attempts to reach Phillip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news agency in Charlottes, reports that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call request to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Service was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is against Bordini Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain has to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity throughout the stomach, not only to local communities and all over London.
For me, this was Heathrow’s great charm, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all of our peoples and regions benefit from the matches.
The Olympics brought huge profits to Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only local communities will create 10,000 new stages and 40,000 new jobs, and the youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Like before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge to expand Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games, and that we would be ashamed before the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Heathrow.
Obstacles are always overcome, but Heathrow responds to every question that is asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is the opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, as well as to leave the inheritance of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a $11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget: from T5, which has been voted for the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the world’s two most busy railways.
Now the team is ready to implement a third grate, supported by $16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow’s expansion will be that.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse in Adblock
For companies that get money from online advertising, the companies that break through the advertising blocking program are “cats and mouse games,” said one of the companies that make such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising blockers on its computer-available pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program’s filters to block again advertising on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its websites was exchanged around the ads so that advertising blockers would make it harder to detect which parts of the site are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it has turned around a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock representative Ben Williams wrote that “this continuous struggle between the open source advertising blocking community and its brokers has been ongoing since the blocking of advertising was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon find its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the struggle is a strong indication of how great concern about advertising blockers has become the industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the past year’s Pagefire and Adobe study. This is four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1,03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company is behind the advertising blockers on the computer-based pages, as mobile advertising blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computers are still bringing enough revenue so that Facebook considers that this action is worth investing.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “advertising” tool to give people more power about how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This isn’t a good experience for people, and we’re planning to deal with the problem,” Facebook’s representative said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we’ve instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman dropped under a car on a Swiss motorway due to suicide
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for eyewitnesses after the woman stayed on the motorway of several vehicles under Thursday early hours in the case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a “disappointing act” and stood in the darkness laying on the road where several passengers hit her, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly attempted to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Switzerland woman, who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been interrogated, but not all have yet been identified, the police said, calling on them and all the witnesses who witnessed the incident to sign up.
Criminal investigation has begun, which is a “logical” step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
“We’re going to see if any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
It will be resolved by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - where both were a person walking on the dark motorway - it was estimated that drivers could not wait to encounter a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from accusations of negligence-based death confidence after he demonstrated and killed a man who was lying on A!-road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and had gone on the road, the court was informed.
The court found that the police, who was responding to the emergency call, was driving in a reasonable way, and that the man’s position on the road was “a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the Thursday case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once to reside
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to be living once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to what climate scientists use.
The model was designed to find out if the hot, waterless surface and carbon dioxide filling with the atmosphere of Venus could sometimes be ground conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation rate of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, ground-based atmosphere, and it could still have been rotating slowly.
The model also looked at the surface shape of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have Earth's dryer areas, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water deforestation.
The earliest Venus was also the advantage of a 30 percent slower sun.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that works like a shadow protecting the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees colder than the present on Earth.
The model produced a story of the evolution phases of Venus, which is similar to what planet scientists had previously assumed.
Though Venus was likely to be ever inhabited, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans drowned and its waters burned in an ultraviolet foam.
When it fled, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomenon - Venus, which we know today, was left.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Leaves Avalanche's Trainer
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the action of Colorado Avalanche coach and Deputy Head of Hockey Affairs, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the decision-making process of the team.
Colorado Vice-CEO/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and said the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have fulfilled my duty as Deputy Director and Chief Trainer in Colorado Avalanche Hockey Affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I have long thought about how to improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to this, the view of the coach and Deputy Head of Hockey Affairs must be fully in line with the organization’s view.
He must also have the ability to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for this contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named winner of the Jack Adams Award for the League's Best Coach in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the central division to victory, but Minnesota defeated in the first round of Colorado's defeat games, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 balances, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the western conference's wild card drop spot.
The Hall of Fame chosen painter Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanch.
Northern oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
North Sea oil workers' labour struggles for wages are postponed as all the parties in the dispute are sitting down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
A strike against the oil field service company Wood Group has been held randomly at the North Sea border plants led by the Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process to address the current dispute,” he said in a joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, so that we can take the problems to a fresh view base.
According to the trade unions, their recent labor struggle, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was an opposition to possible, up to 30 percent wage breaks.
This year, Wood Group played North Sea entrepreneurs' rewards by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration decrease follows a 10% decrease in its country’s entrepreneurs from 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would give the company the necessary mobility to survive the decline in the market.
Shell, in turn, has reduced thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company will relieve its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is worsened by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region’s economy.
“We need a economy that works for many, not for few, both in the North Sea and throughout the country,” he said in a statement.
It is expected that more than $1.4 billion will be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotating speed of the stars in the Plejades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of the rotating speeds of the stars in the Plejadic group.
The new information will help astronomers understand why the stars in a star group rotate at variable speeds, and how the rotating times are associated with planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star sets, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even its history of the solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, Pasadena, in a press release.
The Playoffs are located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars are born about 125 million years ago, and are just now achieving adulthood.
They are now turning at their top.
With its highest rotating speed, these adult-generating stars raise large amounts from the spacecraft.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star clouds, such as sun clouds.
The list of the latest rotating speeds of stars indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
The Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the larger of which make the piruets slower than the smaller.
“In the play ballet, we see that slow rotors are generally more massive, while the fastest rotors are generally very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the Plejadic star group is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for the assessment of the properties of the stars at rotating speeds.
“The Plagiaric Star Assembly offers an anchoric star rotation to theoretical patterns that cover both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why, and why the stars slow down their rotation and so-called hanging their ‘dancing’ on their nails.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Plejadic rotating speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
