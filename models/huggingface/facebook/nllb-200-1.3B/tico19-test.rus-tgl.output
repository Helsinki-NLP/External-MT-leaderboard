According to the data available today, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most people recover.
About 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into more severe forms requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% develop into critical forms requiring intensive therapy.
The mortality rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends in cumulative COVID-19 cases in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
COVID-19 has spread to other countries since the outbreak in China, and currently the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the rest of the world at the same pace as in China.

The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020 all three cases were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases in each country of the world daily at 8:00 a.m., from official sources such as the health ministries of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyse the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and to compare it with data in Italy.
As an indicator of the spread of active cases of COVID-19, the 14 day cut-off cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 AM on 15 March 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and UK
Trends for the development of cut-off cumulative COVID-19 over the 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were consistent with the trends observed in China's Hubei Province (Figure 1).
Covid-19Cumulative illness in the EU/EEA and UK as a whole started to rise around 21 February, and a sharp jump occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of registered cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative increase in COVID-19 were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8:00 AM on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK, is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 disease suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.

However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data to supplement the current observational data, which are the number of cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011 in Europe, there is a significant dispersion in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.

The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 Express Risk Assessment presents modelling scenarios for the load on health systems with estimated data on the hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of shortage of available ICU beds exceeds 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by EU/EEA and UK regions and hospitals and ICUs are usually serving a specific territorial population, it is recommended that information on cases and the number of ICU beds be provided where possible by Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.

As reported in the latest ECDC Express Risk Assessment Report, a rapid, preventive and integrated approach to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 is of great importance, with a subsequent shift from containment to minimization, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, take and appropriately adjust their response unless such measures are taken early.
The report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

If this is not done, then in the coming days or weeks, the healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
The outbreak of the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: at the moment in China and other countries of the world, more than 3,000 people have died, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused thousands of people to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people and men more often than women.

We'll look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of this disease.

The epidemic started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is the #1 enemy for society and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months there have been over 200 publications about COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.

Though, we've encountered two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses in this century, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks originally in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrifying rates of disease severity and mortality.
COVID-19
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first report of clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown origin came to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.

SARS-CoV-2 was found to be susceptible to infection in all age groups, but mostly affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31/100 000), than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters mostly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.

Coronavirus
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In case of infection with SARS and MERS type coronavirus, the shell-like spike growths (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidaze-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, with a genome that is 99.98 percent identical to the 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak site, in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.

It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S-protein binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to be less ill than SARS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2's orf3b protein may play some role in terms of virus pathogenicity and suppressing IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, the team led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on cryoprotection of the structure of the human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included both open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which is evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.

Origins and intermediate owner
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via the tibet and camels respectively.

Ji et ses collègues ont suggéré que les serpents ont été les transporteurs du virus des chauves-souris aux humains, ce qui a entraîné une recombinaison homologique dans la protéine S.
Long-nosed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on the 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2s physical and chemical properties are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 4050 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the activity of the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.

So we can only reference earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the virus that gets into the host body is first recognized by the innate immune system via image-recognition receptors (IRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoVs, however, can avoid an immune reaction by using the N-protein.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is activated to fight the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help the immune system.
,,,..............................................................................................................................
Immunity, which includes components like C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies released from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a hyperreaction of the immune system causes a local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to polyorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 37 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
The later study described above, based on demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.07.2) days.


Do you think the quarantine should be extended to 24 days?

Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia within a week of onset.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus in order to establish an early diagnosis even when there are no pathologies on the chest images.
Temperature, 76 dry cough, 55 shortness of breath and 3 diarrhea; 8 % of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained in two recent studies of family transmission and transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals.

80% of these patients needed ventilation, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients, and corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.

100 %), 275 %), 4042 %), 2025 %) and sore throat (1325 %), and 1420 % of patients require artificial ventilation of the lungs.



According to earlier research, the baseline reproduction index (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) within 5.717.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV are compared in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 in Table 1.1.
SARS-CoV-2
Thus, to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much harder than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation is often seen in a family or group of people who are gathered together for some reason or who are on a transport such as a cruise ship.
Pasientes han frecuentemente viajado a Wuhan o a otras regiones afectadas, han vivido allí o han tenido contacto con personas infectadas o con personas enfermas en las últimas dos semanas antes del inicio de la enfermedad.

In early stage patients, the number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood is normal or reduced.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphocytes with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine-aminotransferase and virusesemia.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
In patients with severe disease, the levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin, present in the blood, were elevated, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.

Pneumocyte dysfunction types I and II decreases the level of surface-active connections and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst X-rays often coincide with the most severe cases.
18 Feb 2020 The first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the layering of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, and the multi-nuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, correspond to the pathology of viral infection and MRSA and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in diagnosing COVID-19 was used the method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).

The situation was similar with the diagnosis of SARS.

On February 14, 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK to detect SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for detecting synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at a density from 20 × 1018 mol/L to 200 × 1018 mol/L using indicator strips in less than an hour without using sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if it is tested successfully in clinical drugs, can significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.

These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.

Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages attacks primarily the lungs, and may also affect other ACE2 expressing organs to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
everybody knows that the most dangerous thing is the respiratory failure.

Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.

It is known that the cytokine storm is a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the primary cause of RBD and polyorgan failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
For the treatment of cytokine storm, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies, which serve as an inhibitor of interleukin-6, were used.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune reaction directed at control of T-cells; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF cytokines; suppression of ionizing kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone acetalase inhibitors.

In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
You should carefully monitor the interactions of these medicines with other medicines prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production

And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often has relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Based on this assumption, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation severity and viral load decreased, and their blood oxygen saturation increased.


For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It's not easy to design and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the active antibodies or to do screening to find active antibodies against the critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various ailments.

Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain action, as it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recoveries from COVID-19 was recorded in a number of Chinese provinces where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87%, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
This is a fairly rough comparison, however, as the assessment has to be made taking into account a variety of other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine treatment and Western medicine and Traditional Chinese medicine combined treatment.
They found that patients who used a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine were significantly less likely to regain body temperature, alleviate symptoms, and receive treatment in hospital than patients who were treated only with Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who started to get worse (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the group that was treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group that was treated by Western methods alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).

Pasiente que sospechan o han confirmado tener COVID-19 suelen tener un fuerte miedo a la enfermedad aguda e incluso mortal, y las personas que están en la cuarentena también experimentan aburrimiento, soledad e irritación extrema.
Infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there have been reports of a number of psychiatric disorders, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

In the course of animal studies, weakened live SARS vaccines have been developed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                

To combat MERS, strategies have been developed for vaccination using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruslike particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunity individuals is an urgent and critically important task requiring a solution to curb the raging epidemic.
Though there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine, and the dynamic variation of coronavirus.
COVID-19
In most cases, patients manage to recover gradually without complications.
COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.

Based on the clinical trial data presented at the moment, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of disease progression in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Â Âge: Âge was the most important factor in predicting the course of SARS-related illness, which is also true for COVID-19.

Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have original illnesses and complications and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive therapy (average 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in males than in females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Covid-19 patients requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiology was also the primary cause of death in SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's worth noting that age and disease of origin are closely related and can distort the results.
Abnormalities detected in laboratory studies: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to consider it as a potential prognostic factor for disease progression, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis for COVID-19.

These enzymes are released in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released when tissue is damaged.
So they're traditionally a marker for heart or liver dysfunction.

As corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, causing lifelong disability and low quality of life.

Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpectedly intense stress, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high levels of uncertainty and watch their relatives and other patients die.
To relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, they should be given psychological counseling and long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic in its characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2,like other coronavirus causing common colds, can successfully replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
Só, así, que los pacientes que tienen la enfermedad en etapas tempranas o que aún no han terminado el período de incubación, pueden, en su vida normal, propagar el virus a escala considerable, lo que dificulta considerablemente el control epidemiológico.Só, por esta razón, que los pacientes que tienen la enfermedad en etapas tempranas o que aún no han terminado el período de incubación, pueden, en su vida normal, propagar el virus a escala significativa, lo que dificulta considerablemente el control epidemiológico.

Today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's much harder to control.


According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of extinguishing will last 34 months.

Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues have calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team led by Ira Longini have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.


According to initial projections, the Ebola fever was to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.


Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by high transmission rate through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which means that it's possible that it's also transmitted via oral feces.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 medical staff.

Usage of face masks is the first line of defense in reducing the risk of infection; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro droplets of fluid from potentially infected individuals from spreading in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
N95 mask (series 1860s) is the only mask that can protect against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm size virons, they only pass 5% of the virons; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm size.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical workers in direct contact with patients should definitely wear N95 class masks (series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Viruss can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 class mask; it may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

China's health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more carefully to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages of development rather than to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and regularly check and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-CoV-2), started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread all over China and at the time of writing, it has spread to 50 countries.
Since the virus is very similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a feeling of SARS recurrence.

COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10,91 % versus 1,44 %).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even in asymptomatic disease, whereas SARS patients usually only infect others in severe cases, so containing the spread of COVID-19 is harder than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
Toda estaa aumentao o risco de propagação do vírus.

What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission pathway, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any moment.
Molekyular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but exactly how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Do the viruses also bind to ACE2 producing cells in other organs?
without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does a virus genetically evolve in the process of being passed from person to person?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur like the flu?
These are all important questions, but it will take time to answer these and many other questions.

Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how catastrophic and life-threatening the human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 has again attracted attention to coronavirus and surprised us with the high transmissibility but weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to its relative SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, for whom they are not pathogenic.

The identification of animal vectors directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The interactions of animals that carry coronavirus may also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on their history of detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and ways of interspecies transmission.
It's important to note that we're comparing and matching different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.

The conditions necessary for successful carrier switching and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease course are also noted.
Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA strand.
These viruses, with the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, are named for their shape, which when viewed under the electron microscope resembles a crown.

About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including the spike protein (S), the shell protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and the nucleoproteins (N).
In other lines of coronavirus also encoded a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus), with beta-coronavirus species including most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses are bats and rodents, whereas birds are the primary reservoir for gamma and delta coronaviruses.

The remaining five beta-coronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus of the second type.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and exopulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted the common cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.

The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; over 8,000 people were infected, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.

It may also tell or speed up the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial for preventing the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review contains general information about the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we're identifying and considering the following common feature: the original viruses that human coronavirus originated from are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but they become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also study the evolutionary trend of human coronavirus, where increasing transmissibility is often accompanied by decreasing pathogenicity.
In this same context, the outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also being considered.

The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from respiratory samples taken from patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; further, this virus adapted to multiply in WI-38 lung cell lines.
HCoV-229E patients showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough being observed in 1020% of cases.
Then, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of mice.
HCoV-OC43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread in the world and are usually transmitted in the wintertime in temperate latitudes.
The incubation period of these two viruses is generally less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems have severe lower respiratory tract infections.

SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage levels.
30% of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In severe cases, other organs can also be infected besides the lower respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a patient's relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been made to research human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first identified as primarily affecting young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 is characterized by chills, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the same virus being isolated from nasal swab taken from an eight-month-old boy in the Netherlands who had pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with peak of disease occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.

Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory illness, has been detected worldwide.
All four of these outpatient human coronavirus have adapted well to humans, and their mutation to cause highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been reported and their causes unknown, as in the rare case with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory infection in China.
Typically, by acquiring the ability to transmit and retain in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but various European countries and Tunisia have reported cases of introduction and spread through episodic secondary cases of infection through close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  For both infections the characteristic is progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-to-human coronavirus.
Over 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.

The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been named coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).

1.2%, while in Hubei province, China, the death rate is 4.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, coronavirus, causes severe respiratory infection, characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia
Though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have no symptoms, which indicates that the virus can spread rapidly worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 and six other human coronavirus are compared and contrasted, revealing important similarities and differences.
Primo, coronovirus transmisi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
SARS-CoV-2show the same trend as the other six human coronaviruss in this regard.
Second, in severity of symptoms, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus causing outpatient infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection manifestations are similar to what is most often seen in human coronavirus infections causing outpatient infections, including nonspecific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, we can identify a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both for the human coronavirus causing outpatient infections and for SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronavirus causing outpatient infections. SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronavirus causing outpatient infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. infecting each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other human coronavirus causing outpatient infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a seasonal virus that causes outpatient infections.

All four human coronavirus, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be considered the only survivors of the human coronavirus pandemics of the past.
The human coronavirus causing severe illness in humans and the people in whom the human coronavirus causing severe illness simply did not survive.
To do this, human coronavirus must replicate in the human body to the extent that there is a buildup of adaptive mutations that counteracts the limiting factors of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.

These viruses don't need a reservoir animal.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to preserve and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for the chance to get into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and the four outpatient HCoVs.
It's very easily transmitted, like out-of-hospital HCoVs, at least for now.
THE COV is more pathogenic than outpatient HCoVs, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
Tas remainedto see if it adapts completely to humans and if it will circulate in human environments without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.

An animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier carries HCoVs continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate vector can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing vector, allowing the virus to replicate in a flash and then transmit it to humans, amplifying the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can carry a dead end infection if they can't withstand transmission inside an intermediate carrier.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had in anamnesis contact with hunting-hunting animals (wildlife).


This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that once all the tibetans in the markets had been eliminated, no SARS cases were reported.

They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.

These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses have 8892% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for the new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.

SARS-CoV is known to be a receptor for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, derived from bat fecal samples, uses ACE2 from bats, civet and humans as a receptor for entry into the cage.

WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.

Filogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV as the same group as both bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptidypeptidase-4 (DPP4), for virus penetration.
The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences from bat betacoronavirus detected in Europe and Africa.
Till now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 in bats are only 87%.
i.e. bates might not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-legged camels are seropositive to the neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of one-legged camels, further confirming camels' role as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive virus secretion.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels released the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus release in bats.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology is 96.2% identical to the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from Asian horse-riders Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute to them a parental relationship.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The animals that are the immediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which has been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a likely case of transmission from animal to human.

92% of the DNA sequences of these new coronavirus pangolins are the same as SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, with an identical nucleotide sequence of about 90%.
They cluster in two subline of differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with amino acid sequence identity at 97.4%.
SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
In early study of sick pangolins, it was also reported that viral contingencies were detected in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a genome sequence, which includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It is not excluded that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate animals-carriers of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2s evolutionary pathway in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.

Theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2, is related to parallel evolution via selectivity.
The opposite proposition is for a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolins, a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in a third species of wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronavirus.
The direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not definitively determined.

Filogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronavirus, while parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American three-colored suckler-legged, was reported to demonstrate close affinity with HCoV-NL63.


Filogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoVs' interspecies transmission events in the anamnesis.
When around 1890 the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred and people were infected from pets, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Alphacoronaviruses are in between.

First, it was humans, not alpacas, that were able to contact bats in a shared ecological niche.

Second, bat alfalfacoronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alfalfacoronavirus has caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.

Bates are actually the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
,,,,,,,,,,
On the other hand, whereas bat alfalfacoronaviruses could be the gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and unicorns could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of interspecies transmission from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has subsequently been confirmed by subsequent studies.

Longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats ideal spreaders
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was introduced to one-horned camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from an intermediate carrier evolved into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes very mild disease and is characterized by relatively low mutation frequency.
The episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain the dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.

They may be the deadliest carriers of the beta-coronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, we need to confirm or rule out several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcing carriers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus got into recently.

It's possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing pets and wildlife for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as stated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Besides the different types of animal hosts, there are three main factors from viruses that also contribute to crossing the interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Coronavirus have a corrective exoribonuclease, removal of which leads to extremely high mutation rates and weakening or even non-viability.
Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue inhibits the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdecivir
Though, the frequency of mutations in coronavirus is almost a million times higher than their carriers.

SARS-CoV-2 has a lower mutation rate than SARS-CoV-2 with a higher mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Supposedly, this virus has already adapted to another vector similar to humans.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs are theoretically unlikely to quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Two, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater flexibility in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are present.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the 3′-end direction of the genome.
Third, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, the coronavirus randomly and frequently switches the matrix during RNA replication.

Virustransmitter interaction in relation to transmission 
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This article uses SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly in different carriers, especially with respect to mutations on the S protein RSD.
S protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's antibody response selects it intensively.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, from the 318th to the 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV RSDs are able to recognize APF2 receptors in different animals, including bats, civets, mice and an enotated dog, making it possible for the virus to be transmitted between species.
actually only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD that are different from the human and civet virus strains, with 4 of them being in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV cyveta has K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes might be particularly important for the virus to adapt to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the S protein leads to the fact that the binding affinity of the S protein to human APF2 may have changed.

It would also be interesting to determine if any other correceptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as N aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
Besides cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also driven by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, monogamy camels and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.

In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The diversity of bat coronavirus creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronavirus serves as a genetic pool for HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that code for proteins has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion was found, characteristic for SARS-CoVs.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier switching.
SARS-CoVs also have a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Re-combination localizations have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subject to recombinant events between different lines, which happened in Saudi Arabian one-eyed camels.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are most likely the result of the virus being freed from the selection pressures, for example, from the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to two-nucleotide deletion.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats are effective in reducing the pathology caused by coronavirus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the carrier.
nten, it's no coincidence that in the last 20 years, there've been three new human coronaviruses.
Coronavirus
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the host.
tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttTYTYTYTY
The severe symptoms are associated with an overactivated immune response and a cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same nonbinding immune response strategy might have favorable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bates are particularly prone to interferon.
Typ I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, bat has disturbed the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome.
Based on this, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasome with MCC950 may prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general pattern as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Though civets and other animals in the market have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.

Coronavirus
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoVs in human transmission.

If SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and ticks in markets, closing wild tick markets and destroying ticks on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.

MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around for a long time in camels.

They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.

To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
n't we can eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can appear causing outbreaks.

In particular, the bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are a lot of possibilities for these zoonotic coronavirus to evolve and recombine, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or more lethal to humans.
To reduce the number of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.

nfact,manyviruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until they are able to take over new territories.
Though many of the features of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, they can minimize the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species.

To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some pieces in the puzzle of zoonotic origin.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the true intermediate carrier is a third mammal, then we need to figure out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Lastly, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.

This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
Recommendation on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), was published in seven editions between January 16 and March 3, 2020, with some of its provisions substantially changed.
Zhou and his co-authors recently commented on our recommendations, which were simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We acknowledge the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
Recommendations for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (trial version 7) and current research findings, however, also need to be updated.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its environs or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases have been reported within 14 days before symptoms appear; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other settlements where COVID-19 cases have been reported within the last 14 days before symptoms appear; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed illnesses (≥ 2 cases characterized by high fever or respiratory symptoms, recorded within 2 weeks in small premises such as a school, office or apartment).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on a case of suspicion of disease with one of the following items of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, or an increase in titer of at least 4 times on phasers relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition the need for serological evidence was added.
The changes are based on the results of the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sample selection, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.


The evaluation system also requires further clarification in further clinical practice and research.

Woolworths said last week sales were up sharply.
Canberra's Costco last week also limited this to two packs.
To fill the gap, Coles started ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish stocks, but this was hampered by local government restrictions on the timetable of trucks.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less profitable offers are available.


He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the number of warehouse stocks is small, and after selling the entire volume of the commodity, the long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stocks.
Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, customers probably wouldn't panic so much, says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent branded products, reported that they are working around the clock to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the lack of buyers during Labor Day holiday week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first participants in the auctions.
The fourth issue of the Darwin daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the amount of goods they purchased, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantry, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, apart from the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic

Pandemia is a term that describes the scale of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take action:
Today, all countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.
"We are all in this together", he said. "We are all in this together".
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February thatno other respiratory virus besides influenza has been traced since its emergence to its continuous global spread.

WHO first declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January, and then re-designated it as a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, commented on the outbreak:This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse
According to Associated Press, as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, and over 4,600 people have died.
2020 pandemic of coronavirus.  is the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently, on 11 March 2020, declared a pandemic.


China has a mortality rate of 4%, while the global rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are possible complications.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people who suspect they are infected.

The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortage of goods, compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have been closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's students.

The infection cases were mostly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a newly discovered virus that has a lot of similarities to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
Morning Post South China section published on 13 March 2020 that the first case was reported in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019.[citation needed] On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular, because of the many cases with weak symptoms.

The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.

The study published on 16 March showed that in China, by 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of registered cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) of infection for COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, the most frequent time being 14 days.


The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, as official figures may not include deaths of people who did not pass testing for example, in cases of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.

We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual.His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the US.Similar accounting with incomplete data is often seen in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.The first confirmed death was recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia  in France on February 14.

Some scientists have tried to calculate these values for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Evidence Medicine Center, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39%.
The top of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
WHO says the current pandemic is manageable.

Macie Bonny, of the University of Pennsylvania, says that uncontrolled outbreaks tend to plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers runs out, they begin to subside.

On March 17, Adam Kucharsky from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2will be circulating, perhaps within a year or two.
Till a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more), physical distancing and other measures will be required, according to a study conducted by Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson.
I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away completely because it's so easily transmitted and also because it can become a seasonal disease with outbreaks every year.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
Temperature elevation (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up, and redness of the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend putting people who are in close contact with patients who have a confirmed diagnosis under strict monitoring and testing for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease varies from a few to 44% of all cases.
The typical incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.

The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, when coughing openly, the droplets can spread at a distance from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).

The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as the lungs.

It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted via feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the test results have been positive for three days before symptoms appear, and this suggests the possibility of transmission of the virus before symptoms are manifested.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person who is infected usually infects 23 other people. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
On plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live for up to three days, on cardboard surface  for one day, and on copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.

There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, just as you would after contact with other surfaces that infected people might have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.

In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the sequences of the genome of the pangolin and human viruses.
The largest percentage of similarity (92%) between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been shown by whole-genome comparison to date, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Virus infection can be preliminarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this must eventually be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (PCR) analysis of the infected secret or by computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
The American College of Radiology has published a recommendationnot to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of these was published on January 17.
Testing for polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is conducted.
It can be done on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed using nasoglottal swabs, although a zebra swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that allow for the detection of antibodies.

In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.

The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the international database of confirmed cases.

China did a big study comparing chest CT and PCR testing and found that while the images are less specific for infection, they can be deciphered faster; they're also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus with the help of X-rays and computational tomography, have been developed convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence.

Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.

To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, when outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.

WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
71% etanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0,1% sodium hypochlorite, 0,5% hydrogen peroxide and 0,27,5% povidone-iode.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care, all areas of such an establishment, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.

For those who may have been infected, it is recommended to wear medical masks, as wearing masks can limit the volume and range of airborne exhalations that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
Using a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the primary way of infecting, according to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds.Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing a mask does reduce the number of face-to-face contacts.

CDC, USA, recommends wearing non-medical fabric face masks. China has separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places. Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places. Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.

Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit citizens from going out without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the government of Vietnam asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
Austria government has made it mandatory for all food store visitors to wear medical masks.
Israel government also appealed to citizens to wear masks in public places.

Panama: It is mandatory to wear a medical mask when going out; those who cannot afford masks have been advised to sew them at home.

Distancia social (also known as physical distancing)  is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.

The use of the termsocial distancing has been understood to mean that people should be subjected to complete social isolation, rather than staying in contact with other people in alternative ways.Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended to only have sex with your regular partners, who you live with and who you are sure are free from the virus and its symptoms.

The strategy for controlling the outbreak is to contain the spread of the disease, suppress it or mitigate it.


The measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.

Thus, efforts reduce the risk of health services becoming overburdened and provide more time for vaccine and treatment development.


Korea do Sul introduziu um escreñimento massivo e quarentinas localizadas, e também organizaram o funcionamento do sistema de alerta sobre as movimentações de pessoas infectadas.
Singapore has been providing financial support to infected individuals who are self-isolating and imposing heavy fines on those who don't.
Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for accumulating excess medicines. Modeling for the UK and the US showed that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
The best policies to mitigate the spread of disease can reduce the peak healthcare burden by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and healthcare collapse.
Stop may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens sooner), otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic has social and economic costs.

Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting may help to ease symptoms.
depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only harm.

WHO also reported that some traditional and home remedies may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary care clinics and services to facilitate resource redistribution at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, abolishing late procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available IVA devices and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection so-calledzero patient could have arisen.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection was probably reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

30 de diciembre, un grupo de médicos de la clínica central de la ciudad de Wuhan advirtió a sus colegas sobre elcoronavirus, similar alSARS.
8 of these doctors, including Li Wenlian, were warned by the police about responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising panic.

Wuhan Health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.

According to the latest official data, as of 20 January 2020, symptoms of the disease had already appeared in 6,174 people. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in terms of the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, worldwide there were more than 1.61 million cases, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.



26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that number had risen to 2.6 billion people about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the validity of which has not been verified, this date is  17 November.
26 décembre, le médecin Zhang Jissian a travaillé sur un cas de pneumonie de type inconnu, dont le 27 décembre, sa clinique a notifié le Centre de contrôle et de prévention de la maladie de Jianghan dans la ville de Wuhan.
The initial genetic testing of patients' samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.

WHO was notified the same day.

China National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no evident evidence of the newly discovered virus' ability to spread from person to person.

Röntgenograms of the breast have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT results may have value even before symptoms appear.
matal glass type double-sided multi-doll subpleural sealant focuses with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of pebble bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic, showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the CDC recommends that PCR be used for initial screening.
The immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after 7 days of symptoms, to determine immunity and for the purpose of population control. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT).
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT is usually performed using a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
PoCT is a single blood sample that is usually taken by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling stage is not required for sampling analysis.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has only approved one test for emergency authorization for use. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The test is performed on several hundred samples within a few hours, and therefore works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of viral RNA.

This lab, which is deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab of this scale in the world to operate outside of China.

The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kit, which is sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, leading to a lack of test kits in the US. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the US were experiencing problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts claim that the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.

16 Março, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) pediu que se aumentasse o desenvolvimento de programas de teste como melhor maneira de retardar a propagação da pandemia do COVID-19. Como resultado do aumento da demanda de teste, causado pela rápida propagação do vírus, muitos laboratórios privados dos EUA, que recebiam centenas de milhares de amostras de test, foram sobrecarregados, e as reservas de materiais para coleta de amostras e reagentes químicos rapidamente se esgotaram.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.

Researchers working in the Italian city of Vovo, where the first person in Italy died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


The statistical study showed that in countries where more testing was done compared to the number of deaths, the mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO is recommending countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, to send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 out of these 16 control labs are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
% positive results in the following graph depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.

also reduces infant mortality in home births.
2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.

This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.

Pneumonia, one of the major complications of RA, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, claiming the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after toileting, becoming a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.

also prevents impetigo disease, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying out and consequently to damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing hands too often can lead to itching and scaling of the skin to a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There are five so-called critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.


2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US is closer to the middle on this list, with a rate of  77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China  23%. There are currently several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing of schoolchildren at a set time of day  is one of those methodologies that helps children learn to do this.
The Emergency Medical Care Program implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of a large scale effort to strengthen children's health and improve children's education.
The national programme is based on de-helminthization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride tooth brushing.
The same program is being successfully conducted in Indonesia.

Soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may have gotten onto it in the previous use.
The small number of studies that have been done on bacteria coming into the skin from a contaminated piece of hard soap suggests that this is unlikely, since bacteria wash away with the foam.
Central Committee of the Communities still argues that Liquid soap with a hand-dose is the preferred option for hand washing.
Antibacterial soap is heavily promoted in health-conscious communities.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
So even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selective to antibacterial soap, their efficacy may not match the advertised.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on your hands.
Ropa de higiene para las manos (sanitizer) o antiseptico para las manos  es un producto para la higiene de las manos que no contiene agua.

Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, which provide ease of use for these products and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective in killing microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.

Alcohol-based disinfectants are almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to carefully treat and soak the skin of the hands on both sides.
Rub the face and back surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.

The popularity of these disinfectants is due to their ease of use and quick destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing if there is a possibility to use soap and water.

The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact scarring syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in disinfectants, are virtually nonexistent.
The lower incidence of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants over soap and water.

The effectiveness of a non-alcohol hand disinfectant is largely dependent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.
Recently, it has been shown that benzalkonium chloride has persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side effects.
Many people in low income communities can't afford soap and they replace it with gold or clay.
Aloe or clay may be more effective than just water, but they'll always be less effective than soap.
one of the problems with this method is that if the clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can actually increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative if soap is not available.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends handwashing techniques, which include the following steps:
Wipes your hands in hot or cold running water.
It's recommended to use running water, because standing water can be contaminated, and the temperature of the water doesn't really matter.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when people use soap (and not just water), they tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Treading helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Wipes your hands under running water.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet hands are more prone to getting dirty, and the areas that people tend to neglect most are the big toe, wrist, fingertips, and fingernail areas.
Prints and cracked nail polish can contain a host of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.

Efficient hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, however there is some debate over the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.

2008 The European Paper Towels and Towels Symposium sponsored by the University of Westminster in London, conducted a study comparing the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased on average by 194%, and on the palms  by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 42%, and on the palms  by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreases to an average of 76%, and on the palms  to 77%.

The hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.

There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the rate of infection.
The medical hand washing lasts for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.

The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical settings: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with catheter use by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet with an image of a standard hand washing and treatment procedure that should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO Hand Hygiene Guide is also available on the WHO website and is open for public discussion.
The corresponding review was co-authored by Whitby.
If you need to confirm compliance with the regulations, you can use commercial devices to measure the indicators and check the hand hygiene.

In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.

For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a hand washing tap, although there are cheap ways to arrange hand washing in such places.

Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary.
One example of handwashing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach: it promotes the implementation in schools of simple cost-effective measures that encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as well as complying with other hygiene requirements.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Installation of hand washers  is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of hand hygiene information campaigns with the aim of reducing the incidence and mortality of children.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emojis, symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in comparison to DALYs (saved life years without disability).
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.

Washing your hands is a statement of your unwillingness to take responsibility for something or be a part of something.
Pontius Pilate washed his hands when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; subsequently the phrase gained wider usage in some English communities.

It was also found that people who had remembered or witnessed an unethical act were more likely to wash their hands than other people, and handwashing was more important to them.

The symbolic washing of hands with water but without soap,  is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing hands after going to the toilet.

The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they show signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.

This may include employees who are in contact with the public, e.g. in schools, workplaces with high population density and some large retail stores.

OSHA considers that medical staff and morgue staff who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; however, the risk increases to very high when such staff perform procedures that involve the formation of aerosol or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
The risk control measures appropriate for such staff include the use of engineering and technical safety devices such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects on the workplace.


Finally, there may be disruptions to the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19. When organizing protection, you can use the Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising in homes and communities, and individual workers' risk factors such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
Plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as emergency action plans for situations that may arise as a result of an epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be guided by national or state level recommendations.
Some of the goals for providing an epidemic response include: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, sustaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such means according to their effectiveness.
Administrative measures and finally, personal protective measures are the most effective when it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19.

Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help in eliminating some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the worker, fit for size (e.g. respirators), be used consistently and properly, be checked regularly, maintained properly and replaced as needed, and be removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers that the lowest risk jobs have the lowest contact with the public and their colleagues.

The early identification and isolation of individuals who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay home until the heat, fever and many other symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours without the use of heat suppressants or other medications that relieve symptoms, and also recommends flexibility in hospital records policies, allowing staff to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with a medium risk require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who have no confirmed data or suspected COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or due to the person's recent travels to places where COVID-19 is spread.

In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.

Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a bio-safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. In commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the ship's medical centre if there is heat or other symptoms in anyone on board.
Infection control centres are the primary health care providers for the school, and the CDC recommends that schools and childcare facilities be closed for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person has been in the school, regardless of the extent of the disease in the community.

OSHA considers certain categories of healthcare and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk.

They have a very high risk of infection when they perform procedures that involve aerosol formation or when they collect/process samples from people with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The procedures that are associated with the formation of aerosol include probing, procedures that cause coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.

In some health facilities and morgues, negative pressure ventilation can be an effective measure.
The samples should be handled with the precautions for Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to segregated waiting zones depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. Along with other personal protective measures, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting within 6 feet with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons performing procedures that accompany the formation of aerosol.
In the USA, NIOSH approved facial respirators with N95 or higher filter class must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which specifies requirements for individual device selection and medical examinations.
OMS do not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted through the respiratory tract, not through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the point of admission.
WHO recommends that individuals collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers without aerosol-based procedures wear a surgical mask, goggles or a face shield, a robe and gloves.

[Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
DATU/WATCH OPPRECTION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

This month, we are living in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We've never had problems like this before, but we know that the effectiveness of our efforts depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation and community development around the world, which is the basis for this organization.
We saw the friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in the emails, the calls and the chats
I am so grateful and proud to be speaking of you as colleagues.
last week, i was told that our work was highly commended.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And that's because of your work, whether it's keeping the sites running, paying our colleagues, or protecting the communities.
The world needs the information that is presented in Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever.
At a time like this, to achieve meaningful results for the world, it's not just what we do, it's how we do it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

c-team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.

The vast majority of us wanted to take the heat off and support our long-term mission.
if you want to back down, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
we expect to be working about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

We don't monitor your work hours.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's obvious and undeniable, but we mention it.
You don't have to sign a sick note or leave: just let your manager know and help the team review their calendar and schedule to ensure they cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please let Brian from T&C Ops know so that T&C can provide support and guidance for your situation.)
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We have already announced and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractors and employees with hourly rates.

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
if you want to work, we'll support you.

What we do can produce amazing results, especially at times like this.
Again, this is self-help.
Please contact your supervisor so we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered substantial.

SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We're initiating a process for all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most meaningful projects.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We don't plan to work twice as hard to make up for lost time once the pandemic is over.
You don't have to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines where possible.
What's going on with the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 Year Plan.
We intend to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while ensuring everyone who needs or wants to work will have a shorter schedule for the next few weeks.
This allows for a significant reduction in the current planning burden and stress across the organisation.
next week we will present our proposal to the council, we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps as soon as we get the confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.

Last week we found out that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
,,,,......................................................................................................................................
They used medical grade anti-virus solutions to disinfect all the surfaces, and also the reception halls and elevator halls, which are the access points to our floor.
The building has its own rules, which require that you be cautious, using products that ensure the safety of your tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our D.C. office is on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in D.C. their COVID-19 policies.
Last week, our D.C. office completely switched to remote work, as directed by the San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a place in Brooklyn.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.

It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them up into a few days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out the materials for the briefing.

The HR Operations team is exploring the ergonomics guides available in webinar format to help distribute work efficiently across the organization.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded mass events like editathons until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand and acknowledge that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to conduct agreed grant activities, and no one will be penalized for unnecessary delays or changes to such objectives.
next week we will be hosting follow-up events with additional guidelines for Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
global community  is not only sadness about the interruption, but also some sense of relief about the understanding and the opportunity to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
As for prospects, CRT is working on a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide a community space that allows for monitoring impact and communication.
We're keeping in touch for COVID-19 related issues.
We'll be sending you an invitation to a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We're in this together and we're willing to help in any way we can.
You can still get information from this email and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff residing in countries that are significantly affected by the current situation.
Contact the CRT for questions about travel, activities, key workflow, coverage issues or if you need any other help.
We're ready to provide support and communication as needed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Any such changes should not be seen as a departure from our work and our obligations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world with the right service.
Our scheduled work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that is ahead in the weeks and maybe months to come.

ACE2
ACE2 opposes the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.

ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain falls onto the surface of cells of the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaze, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs arteries.
ACE2 and RNA biosynthesis is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks down angiotensin I into angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn, cleaves carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of the protein S by the TMPRSS2 carrier serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to suggest that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
Though, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
The use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to the control group, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012.
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were at higher risk of developing pneumonia, particularly patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at general risk of pneumonia.
It is thought that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a breakthrough in acute lung injury therapy and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, with an onset of action of 30 minutes, in addition to a 24-hour exposure duration.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classical RAS inhibitors or for conditions in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with a geo-zoning feature, which aims to  monitor that COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security at the University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false starts and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by only a small portion of the population.

any data exchange with third parties must be defined at the level of legislation;

significant participation of allrelevant stakeholders including public health experts and representatives of marginalized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their list of terms.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as the need for it is no longer there.

Israel has approved network tracking.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have great potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).

Thanks to the fact that the system was not built with a dedicated app, it collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions, and then combined it to create text message notifications that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made location information publicly available, made possible by the significant changes in information protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in this country.


is an established concept with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on privacy-enhancing solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for ensuring privacy, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for making sure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all the matches are on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for ensuring privacy when collecting and using location or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.

The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild, but in some cases the disease can spread to viral pneumonia and polyorgan insufficiency.

568,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or the surface, but they are not transmitted through the air over long distances.

On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
The standard diagnostic method is  real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspected illness and to those who care for them.

Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, nosebleeds, or sore throat, may be less common.
Also, in different percentages, there are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of tightness in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, polyorgan failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
COVID-19's incubation period is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. According to the available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected people.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
China National Health Commission (CNHC) started including asymptomatic cases in its daily reporting from April 1; out of 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and sputum can have a high concentration of the virus.
When speaking loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when speaking at normal volume.
A study in Singapore showed that when you cough openly, the droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not normally transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.

There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms appear, but this risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person who is infected usually infects 23 other people. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
On cardboard surfaces, the virus can live for one day, on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304)  for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.

Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
5 out of 6 patients had the highest virus levels in their blood on the first day, and the 6th patient had the highest virus levels on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.

Pneumonia is the organ most vulnerable to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
shipa (pepperworm) is the surface glycoprotein that binds to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell.
12% of those who were hospitalized in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the work of this organ.

Though SARS-COV-2 has tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have been shown to have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-KSF T cells correlate with IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes recruitment and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.

WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swab, but a swab sample from the nose or sputum may also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and their results are not immediately relevant.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed, movement of citizens has been restricted and large public events have been cancelled.
The distancing guidelines also state that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.

CDC also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends using an alcohol-containing disinfectant (with alcohol content  at least 60%) hand sanitizer, but only in cases where soap and water are not available.
In these compositions ethanol or isopropanol are used, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they're infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extraterrestrial membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen the immune system, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used without instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.

In most cases, the form of the COVID-19 outbreak is not severe enough to require artificial ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.

It is not known whether either of these two methods is as effective as IUD for patients in critical condition.
Some doctors choose invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old) is much higher.

According to one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually end up in the intensive care unit.
The challenge of providing artificial ventilation to the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops with COVID-19 and oxygenation is a growing problem.
IVs with inhalation pressure support and PDCVs are needed to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which can result in pneumothorax.
On earlier models of ventilators, high VDP may not be available.

Remdesivir is the most promising.

Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of recovalent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or imminent danger.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials that must be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.

According to studies of early cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women  1.7%.
Histopatological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exsudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes were found to have viral cytopathic changes.
The lung looks like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China were due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. Access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality vary by condition because of such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.

Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 overall, and these patients were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers. There were concerns about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that some patients who recovered from this disease had a 2030% reduction in lung volume and their scans revealed damage.

According to the current trend of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but there have also been reports of cases where after recovering from COVID-19 the coronavirus tests still turned out to be positive.
It is believed that in these cases, there was an exacerbation of the disease, rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
The Lancet, published in January 2020, cites December 1, 2019 as the earliest date for the first confirmed case of COVID-19.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is  8 December 2019.

All figures vary by region and time of spread, and are also influenced by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections  is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and cases of infection is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).

Though not all patients who have been infected produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can tell how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations amongst the youth, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Besides, the German health care system hasn't been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the donor blood.
COVID-19  la causa oficial de 69 casos de muerte (0,004% de la población).
The impact of a pandemic and the mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women only narrows after the age of 90.
China has a mortality rate of 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral.
Immunological differences between the sexes, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (e.g. hypertension, which occurs in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease  COVID-19.
CO stands for corona, VI virus, D disease, and 19 the year the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
COVID-19
both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".

Enero de 2020, de acuerdo con las recomendaciones de 2015 para el uso de lugares geográficos en los nombres de enfermedades y virus, la OMS recomendó usar los términos Enfermedad Respiratoria Auta 2019-nCov y 2019-nCoV como nombres temporales del virus y de la enfermedad.
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers are printing medical materials such as nasal swab tampons and parts for IVL devices.
In one such case, an Italian clinic needed a ventilation valve urgently, and the supplier couldn't deliver it in the required time, so one of the local manufacturers was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.

The results of the study did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.


SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Trial) is a program that aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds that are considered to be the most effective to date.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both penetrate into human cells via ACE2 receptor, so the research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, is aimed at inducing a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-chip protein which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
Third strategy is developing vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA-vaccins, a new method of creating a vaccine).

The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, over 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-profiling of antiviral drugs constitutes the bulk of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.

Improvement was seen in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.

The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatal outcomes.

Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.Studies showed that for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate via interaction with ACE2 receptor, reconciliation of the spike protein with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was required.
Ozeltavir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytocinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytokinemia. A small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug entered a phase 2 non-randomized trial being conducted nationwide in Italy, after positive results were obtained for use in patients with severe disease.
In combination with serum analysis for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, to people who need them, is currently considered as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have been unconvincing.
Neutralization of virus is an expected effect whereby passive antibody therapy can provide protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in the development stage.
The use of recombinant serum, which is made up of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.
