How did you do that?
If we knew, we'd probably have fixed it by now.
But first, I think we need to add a component like martial arts.
I think we have a problem with that.
Kremlin supports ban on smoking on residential balconies
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save people's lives, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the ban on smoking on balconies and lodges.

There is an administrative penalty for violation.
The Kremlin is positive about any decision that helps save human lives.
"We know how many fires are going on, many of them with very tragic consequences and public outcry.
Therefore, any life saved justifies such decisions", Peskov said.
First of all, the spokesman sees it as a fire-fighting measure, not a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes the US adoption of the Taipei bill
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The US Senate Committee on International Relations' approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, said Ma Xiaoguan.
He said Taiwan is part of China and issues related to it are China's internal affairs.
"We urge the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Sino-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait", he noted.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok is hiding unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years old.
The Chinese government has been trying to
The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, the independence of Tibet or the banned Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reports.
The documents revealed that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is using the app to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.
Most of the violations of Chinese policy fall under "inciting hatred".
In each case, TikTok places the objectionable posts in a context that is appropriate under the general rules so that the social network's actions do not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition on "criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc".
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incident or the Cambodian genocide is a "distorted account of the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the names of 20 "foreign leaders or statesmen" who are banned, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications in the first category are deleted by the social network's administrators and may result in the user being blocked.
The second category is not too strict: similar posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok's algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We now use a localised approach to moderation, and we also engage independent local experts".
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publishing, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producer Center.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers are coordinated with the representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without coordination, reports Bogdanov.
Asked if TikTok allowed commenting on politics or Putin, Bogdanov said yes and said he had seen similar posts.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on".
But any content that moderators don't like can be included under these rules, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only people over 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is underage, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the coworking site WeWork.
Istanbul residents told about the earthquake in the city
A powerful earthquake has triggered panic in Turkey 's largest city
On Thursday, September 26, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake occurred in Istanbul.

After a while, the child developed gangrene, and an amputation was performed.

Russians warned of fake bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in calls from fraudsters who have been using bank phone numbers.
This is reported by Kommersant, citing data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator passed on to telecom operators information on more than 2,5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial institutions were called.
In 189 cases, the operators detected a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and 59 cases were restricted to financial services.
Deputy head of the department of information security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced with the change of number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the lack of such an obligation in the Communications Act.
The Open Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the increase in fraudulent phone calls with number changes.
According to the press service of "Bilina", some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that banks actually use to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would have disrupted the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudulent numbers, which the operator will contact every time a call is made to verify the number.
He explained that to create such a base, amendments to the legislation would be required.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelenskyy the entry of Ukraine into NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary-General spoke about this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue, and also stressed that he did not mention the dates of Ukraine's NATO accession in his answer.
He said any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT reports.
In Crimea , the Green alternative was offered a NATO course
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky should instead pursue a NATO membership course and establish good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegriнец.
"Mr. President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia", Chegrinets told reporters of RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to stay in power if he establishes relations with Russia.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had held a conversation with Zelensky on the country's entry into the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine must meet certain conditions.
On June 5, parliamentarian Yevgeny Balitsky said that Ukraine's possible entry into the alliance did not guarantee better life in the country.

Barcelona are blackmailing Neymar
Spanish club Barcelona and former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Femi.
Otherwise, they'll refuse him entry.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, came up with an interesting trick: according to the agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only that, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Jackets insist the bonus was for the entire 2016-2022 contract.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only owed a quarter of 40 million euros and demands the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barca almost agreed to return the "rogue" player to the Catalan fold.
The deal's broken, but the hope of a return to the forwards remains.
According to Sports.Ru, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the financial claims were not resolved in pre-trial, it would exclude the possibility of the Brazilian returning.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

Rooms in the center of Moscow are rented at the price of a flat in the suburbs
Despite the decrease in the number of communal buildings in Moscow, the demand for them does not fall.
The supply is drawn on demand by room-to-room rentals.
In the center of Moscow, rent is more expensive than in the suburbs - mainly because of the high demand.
The rooms in the centre are rented at the same price as those in the outskirts.
For example, in Hamovniks, the average price of a room is 28 thousand rubles, according to a study by the portal "World of Apartments".
For that money, we can rent a place near the ICAD.

The rooms in North and South Butovo and Novo-Predelkina will be a little cheaper.
How to increase your future pension and not rework it
Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-state pension funds are able to pay pensions.
The NPFs are private companies, reports "Volgogradskaya pravda.ru".
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and over time, it gives you back the money with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first of all, you should read the information about the NPF on the Bank of Russia's website.
All funds operate under the same rules as federal laws.
Pension points can be legally purchased.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you lack to calculate the pension.
This is a good way for those who have been working informally.
You can also make a contribution for a relative, such as a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their career.
The increased pension amounts are paid to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the regions of the Far North.
Take care of it in advance so that you do not miss out on anything when you reach retirement age.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put your money away for deposits.
The most important thing is to keep improving your financial literacy.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of Oakland Park, Florida, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after he waved a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument over a trolley found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a garbage dump outside an empty house.
That's what Todd Beavers noticed on his evening walk.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the rubbish.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could qualify for the cart, since he was the first to start digging in the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knives and started waving it in the direction of the cart hijacker.
Beavers told Miller that the whole thing was on video.
Miller spotted the camera and ran, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Soon afterward, he saw a strange woman come into his yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a woman he did not know and wounded her with a sword.
This was his reaction to guests at a wedding at the same hotel where he was staying who refused to let him smoke.
Mass riots on three
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions, the further it goes, the more noticeably it disintegrates into individual fragments and loses political content.
The evidence of the "mass riots" itself is not well-tested, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on hold, the weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the charges being dropped.
The dissolution of the case should cheer the community, but it will surely leave the security forces extremely irritated, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minayelo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later he was completely rehabilitated: the Criminal Court withdrew the charges against him.
Minaylo was arrested for almost two months, and several professional societies - historians, priests, and writers - joined him.
After that, only two accused of participating in the mass riots remained in the case (initially there were 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samireddin Rajabov, who was arrested the day before by the court until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the government, article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition on Latvia 's accession to the United States
The court of the Visegrad suburb of Riga sentenced the author of the joke petition about the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
The man was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest part of our system", Bartetsky commented on the court's decision.
He also added that punishment is usually less than what is requested.
The signing of Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the Solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetskiy under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the country's Criminal Law - "Public Call to Undermine the Territorial Integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Before that, in 2016, the author of an internet petition about Latvia's accession to Russia was sentenced to six months in prison.

Russian Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet

On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting "two records with information in an indecent form that insults human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

Can phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well-researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (cardiovascular, some types of cancer, among others).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular - soybeans), hops, flaxseeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements cannot replace natural hormones.
The potential for harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, the body may reduce its own hormone production by taking too many of its own hormones from outside.

I couldn't stay away!
I've been at this club for a season and a half.
It was not the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who were always with the team!
I'll always remember the Munitpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal!
The Genesis must be reborn!
He has a great history and a great fan base.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their native club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometeorological Center named the true signs of the people
In Russia, there are many folk charms that people use to try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
Hydrometers checked all the signs that said they were working.
The meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be truly trusted, albeit in the short term.
Roman Vilfand, the head of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, said that if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will be really sunny, as our ancestors had noticed.
And if the sky is white, it's going to rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
They're more likely to talk about swallows, if they're flying low, it's usually before the rain.
The explanation is simple - when the humidity is high, the flies get their wings wet and the birds have to descend to hunt insects, reports TASS.
Different continents have their own folk symbols.
The Day of the Dragon is a traditional holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day one should watch the falcon emerge from its burrow to determine the time of the coming of spring.
Unidentified oil spots found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been discovered on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The contamination was spread over 2,000 miles of coastline.
The first reports of oil spots started arriving on September 2.
However, their numbers continued to increase, as did their coverage, every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's the crude oil.
The state-owned Petrobras Corporation, which was sent the samples for analysis, said they were not composed of oil extracted from Brazil.
"This is thick oil.
It could be dropped off one of the ships after the tanks are cleared.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably fell into the ocean current", said Rosario Almeida, coordinator of the oil industry workers' union in Pernambuco and Paraíba, to Brazil's G1 news portal.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will begin cleaning up the polluted beaches in collaboration with Petrobras.
Meanwhile, the institute advises tourists and locals to avoid oil spots and report any detected sources of pollution.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matviyenko
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, believes that Russians do not have enough savings to fully implement the bill on guaranteed pension products.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another matter how timely it is.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes, which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future", said V. Matviyenko.
Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and calculation, because "the constant changes in this sphere have finally confused them".
That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system that regulates it.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, the social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the national realities", - said V. Matviyenko "RIA Novosti".
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension products) is to develop, then several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
The Russian Ministry of Finance announced on September 6 that it has sent a draft law on guaranteed pension products (GPP) for approval .
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure for joining citizens to the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man is staying in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have a deal.
Image caption The news of the departure of the beloved Marvel superhero has angered many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have agreed to use it in the franchise's films.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which states that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, causing Spider-Man to leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.
She rented them out to Marvel, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from box office receipts, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point this situation was no longer acceptable to Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has said he's thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is continuing.
"We're all excited at Marvel Studios to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a figure of speech.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world", his press release reads.
Faghi also said that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.
"He just happened to be the only superhero to be in different movie settings.
So as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Universe, the future may hold some unexpected surprises", he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commented on the news by posting on his Instagram account a clip from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street", in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
The news of the company's disagreements came in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to get half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man movies on the condition that both companies would pay half of the production costs.
But Sony didn't like that.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new terms are yet to be released.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We've worked well together over the last four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are happy to be able to move forward together".
The Avengers: Endgame, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinema, pushing Avatar from the top spot.

Round three, all clear.
When is the first tournament under the rules you've come up with?
It's the 29th of November.

Trade with Russia is not just about tanks
Trade between Russia and India could double due to the geopolitical situation.
This was stated by Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry Manish Kumar at the V anniversary forum of small and medium-sized business of the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, the guest from Delhi stressed.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
These are all small and medium-sized businesses that are working with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we're not standing still, we're growing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general are just helping us all grow.
Our bilateral trade is now over 10 billion dollars, but we can double that.
First, through new technologies in healthcare, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established first contacts with modern centers of Russia.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum of understanding to create a system that would allow you to build your modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a passion, it's a necessity.
We need a step towards economic prosperity.
We need to expand, attract small and medium businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries we will definitely do it, the Indian industrialist stressed.
We remind you that for the fifth time in a row, Ufa is hosting the Forum of Small and Medium Business of the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries.

In the framework of a working trip to Tobolsk, Tyumen region governor Alexander Moor took part in the solemn opening of the Sokolov water catchment after reconstruction.
Now its capacity is 25,000 cubic meters per day.
The water intake was reconstructed in the framework of the implementation of the federal project "Pure water" under the national project "Ecology".
Investors helped the authorities: the Sokolov reservoir became another example of the use of the mechanism of private-state partnership.
The Tyumen region has a unique experience in this area of cooperation between federal structures, regional authorities, local administration and private investors.
New artesian wells have been built on the site.
They built pump stations over them.
Water purification and disinfection facilities were reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolov reservoir will provide the people of Tobolsk with quality drinking water.
Plans are in place to ring the Sokolov and Zhukov reservoirs.
Then Tobolsk will be able to switch completely to underground water supply.

Congress saw a "Russian trail" in Trump's conversation with Zelensky
In the lower house of the US Congress, Russia was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House Donald Trump and the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

The informant suspected that in a July conversation with Zelensky, Trump pressured his interlocutor to have Ukraine file a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who could become Trump's rival in the election a year later.
The White House had to provide Congressmen and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

Rospotrebnadzor is against returning cigarettes to airports
Rospotrebnadzor is strongly against returning the cigarettes to airports.

The expert told me why you should not drink tea in a tea bag.
A team of scientists from McGill University in Canada found that when a tea bag is brewed, more than ten billion microplastic particles are released into a cup in five minutes.
Pollen particles can also be added to packaged beverages, said Elizabeth Tikhonova, a food safety expert for Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
The oats aren't thrown away at the end of the season, so they could end up in the tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the packages", said Tikhonova.
She says it is better to give up the drink in favor of a tea with a brush, which is sold in specialty stores.
She also stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - the micro-particles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to start to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - it will have the least amount of additives", the expert pointed out.

Regions invited to share secrets of business support
As it became known to the "Parliamentary Gazette", on September 27, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of the Federation Council Andrei Kutupov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation's subjects on improving the legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It 's time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council's Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the existing business development and self-employment legalization programs, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"Today, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by senators has identified the issue of the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole", - said Andrey Kutepov.
In the attachment to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of the data from the regions with proposals and problems (available at the disposal of the editorial office).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the regional data are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive achievements in the regions could give a boost to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be the sending of information available to the Economic Policy Committee", the senator told the "Parliamentary Gazette".
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully implemented programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
For example, the Vologda Region has a Centre for the Support of Entrepreneurship, which, in addition to financial support, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, which provides for the implementation of the one-window principle through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar region, grants are given to new agricultural consumer cooperatives from the regional budget.
In the Orlov region, there is a cluster development center.
Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers, at the expense of the federal budget.
In some other regions, special measures are being taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
The regional authorities believe that a number of changes should be made to the existing legislation to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as this "is most in line with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities performed by self-employed citizens, including activities such as decorating and repairing housing, dacha buildings, and conducting physical training.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers through the "Mercury" veterinary system.
In the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are advocated in the normative and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific law projects", - assured Andrei Kutepov.
The airline helped passengers avoid the neighbourhood with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on a plane, you can now know where young children will be seated.
Now you can avoid them if you want to.
Passengers of Japan Airlines (JAL) have been given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The airline has launched a feature that allows you to track where children will be sitting.
When choosing seats in the cabin during ticket booking, passengers will be able to see the image of the child's head in the seats occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near babies because of the possible inconvenience of their crying may be able to get as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services were thrilled by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he was on a flight from New York to Doha, and next to him were three crying children.
Another commentator suggested introducing "adult-only flights", expressing a willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they will now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with a baby tried to please passengers on a Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared bags of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.

Pavel Ustinov joined the picketing in support of the participants of the "Moscow case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of one-man picketing "Freedom for all", which takes place on Friday near the building of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation on the Old Square in Moscow, reports the correspondent of "Interfax".
The series of picketing began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
Currently, the participants of the action, alternating each other, stand holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom for all" and the names of those convicted and arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Begletz, Yevgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaydulin, Alexey Minayelo, Sergei Fomin, Samirdin Rajabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa are also included in the poster.

After that, on September 20, the court changed the measure of restraint of Ustinov from detention to a subscription not to leave the country on the request of the General Prosecutor's Office.
So, the petition for the release of Ustinov has accumulated over 112 thousand signatures in a day.
Theatre and film artists have launched a flash mob in support of their colleagues.
A line was formed on the Old Square to participate in a one-man picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18.

Supply of sanctioned goods to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimates that agricultural products and food supplies to Russia from countries under Russia's food embargo have decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
It's about supplies that are not under embargo.
As the report indicates, the volume of prohibited imports was compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that in late August, the government extended the deadline for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited for import into Russia in the framework of counter-sanctions, until December 31, 2020.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the rules were extended for one more year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the ban was applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein joined the list, and on January 1, 2016, Ukraine joined.
Putin's decree on the elimination of illegal "sanctions" (food embargoes imposed by Moscow in response to Western sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has authorized the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions persisted, Russia also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing less than 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights under the President of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food products "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the upbringing of people.
Moreover, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs fit for consumption.
After that, the Russian Council for Human Rights issued a similar recommendation to the government.

Chile began construction of a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction of the dome of the building, which will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project yet, has officially begun this week.
The total cost is estimated by ESO to be over a billion euros.
Most of that money will be spent on making equipment and building the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will be about 39 meters in diameter.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflecting surfaces measuring 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help the E-ELT to obtain the first detailed images of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has only just begun construction, scientists, engineers and other experts have been working on mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
