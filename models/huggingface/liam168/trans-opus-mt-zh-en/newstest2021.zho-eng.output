Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where's the talent?
The group of highly qualified rural migrant workers is an indispensable and vital force.

Jang's 34-year-old family is in the village of Orchard in the city of Sichuan Yingshan, and in 2010 he resigned from his Beijing monthly job and returned home to start a business.
After several years of struggle, he now runs the vine farm, which earns more than a million yuan a year, becomes a small and well-known leader in wealth and is also selected to join the village's “councils” team.
In recent years, inspired by a range of pro-farming policies, such as the country ' s fight against poverty and rural revitalization, a growing number of excellent farmers like Zhang have chosen to return to their homes to start their own business, activating a spring water pool in the countryside.
In the western part of the country, the Greater Population Province and the Great Labour Exporting Province, Sichuan, which led to the implementation of the “Better Farmer Retroduction Project”, in 2019 alone, produced more than 8,000 village branch secretaries from among the highly qualified peasant workers who returned, developed a village reserve force of 61,000, and provided more than 20,000 members of the Development Party, providing strong guarantees for winning the fight against poverty and for implementing the rural renewal strategy.
Xiao Xiang is not Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiang, the key is to look after the country.
Since the reform and opening of the country, a large number of the country ' s young and young labour force has gone out to work and collect, and some have started their own businesses by means of spelling.
The objective, however, has also led to various degrees of “emptyness” in rural areas, in particular the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, the “old and low” character of village branch secretaries and party membership, i.e., ageing, low educational qualifications, weak leadership of village organizations, and acute problems of lack of access.
Revitalization is an empty word if elements such as rural talent continue to flow in one direction to the cities, and if the village is in a state of “blood loss” and “anemia” for a prolonged period of time.
Bringing back farmers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their homelands, leading them back to their homeland as leaders of wealth, training from the middle to the top as party members, village cadres, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level, is a solution to the problems of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent farmers are drawn back, and they must be able to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has taken the lead from the Peasant Labour Party by establishing, on the basis of strict selection criteria, institutional mechanisms such as orientation, security of services, training, capacity-building, selection and use of highly qualified rural workers, enabling them to improve their abilities, job security, hope for life, and genuinely take root in rural areas, with a sense of accomplishment on the part of their officers.
This year is the year when the fight against poverty was brought to the fore, and human resources are a key factor in linking the fight against poverty with rural revitalization.
The Government of the Party at all levels attaches great importance to the group of highly qualified returning peasant workers, who, through comprehensive measures, will be left with a viable, combatable, undefeated task force, a robust army that will provide strong organizational security and human support for rural poverty eradication and the revitalization of development.
As a result of the epidemic, this year's university graduates were special. On the night of July 11, Bilibili's summer graduation song brought to the graduates a special live live live live performance, with music like the old wolf, Park, Lee Woo-chun, Mao giving songs and blessing to their fellow graduates.
The well-known pup leader, Seal Wu Yifan, also brought with him a " Weed " , a rap-and-song song that he had adapted from the compatriot collection of Ruthen, which was very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates failed to appreciate the rituals of the field-deeping and diplomas, and they shifted the rituals online.
According to the data, this 2.5-hour song was broadcast live with a peak of over 35 million people.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, take no account of the consequences, and sometimes unanticipated gains.” (ibid., para.
Although it is a graduation song, a number of songs also move non-responsible graduates.
“The whole scene really wants to cry, and everyone's youth is filled with beauty and regret, but it's all worth remembering, and you have to walk with courage.”
Beijing’s natural ecology continues to be good, attracting more than 500 wildlife cities to “settling” - the Middle New Network.
2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Youth News. Author: Wang Si-seok.
The capital's natural ecology continues to be good, attracting wildlife cities to "settling."
Beijing has more than 500 species of wildlife.
A reporter from the Beijing Youth News (Reporter Wang Bin) has learned from the Urban Park Greening Bureau that the species and number of wildlife have continued to grow in recent years as the natural and ecological environment of the capital continues to improve.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrates living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including the protection of animals at the national level, such as maroons, black storks, and the secondary protection of animals at the national level, such as falcons, swans, cranes and thugs.
Whether planted in a single urban forest in two rings, or embedded in a small wetland between buildings, brings not only the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also the “settling” of wildlife into the city.
During the summer season, the Pine Hill National Nature Conservancy, located in the northern-western Yanqing Mountains, was vibrant.
One was playing by the hillside, while the two thugs were fighting each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar can't resist its “piking” of its body, which is stomping on the bark of the tree. The director of the National Directorate of Nature Reserves in Pine Mountain gave a lucid presentation that, by the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including the State-level conservation of animal golden eagles and the State-level protection of animal spoon chickens, pine pine pine, were found in the entire city, almost one third of the species of wild animals.
“In Pine Mountain, wildlife is the true `master' and our staff is, at best, a `guard'.”
In order to gain a field view of wildlife in protected areas, it is said that more than 30 professional escorts are on patrol every day, along 16 carefully designed protection routes, and that there will be a “circum” on a monthly basis, with almost a full day's travel to the entire protected area.
“In the course of the patrol, not only are biodiversity records checked, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of wild infrared cameras, etc.”.
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Pine National Nature Reserve to document the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
Illustratively, as the biodiversity of protected areas has increased over the years and wildlife has become more visible in the lens, leopard cats, thugs and thugs have become “resident guests” and the “opportunity” of the second level of protection of animal pyres is increasing.
Zhang Zhi Minh, Head of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Division of the Beijing Gardens Greening Authority, reported that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing had increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 today, and that the variety and number of wildlife in Beijing had continued to increase in recent years.
The increasing visibility of wildlife in the city is closely linked to the increasing greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new wave of million acres of afforestation, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape urban ecosystems, upgrade the ecological function of green lands on forested lands and highlight the concept of “near nature”.
The plan seeks to interact with the surrounding greenfields, facilitating “family visits” to wildlife, and the planting of trees, which are also the honey and feeding plants that animals love.
I'm committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, can tell you that there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you that woman's smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with this problem, thinking about how human beings understand and live with the world.
Those ideas, memories and stories, in a scenario like this, may draw the attention of the human race.
Interlinkages between the related events.
Maybe you've seen dogs like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and you've raised memories and ideas of past vacations, used to go to the beach, spent with other dogs, running around and running time.
And one of my guiding principles is, by helping computers to understand what this experience is, to understand what we believe and what we feel in common, then we're able to start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, deep digging into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce stories like humans, from the image sequence.
So, one day, while I was working on a computer, I asked it about the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture, saw a tree bag bear.
It doesn't know what a tree bag bear is, but the computer says it thinks a tree bag bear looks like an interesting creature.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images of the house burning down.
The computer looked at the picture, and it said, "This is an amazing landscape!
It makes my back cold.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing and destructive event and think it's a positive thing.
I realized that computers recognized the contrast between red and yellow, and that it was something that deserved a positive evaluation.
Part of it is because most of the computers I enter are positive images.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw your own photo taken at the funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it was task-based, data-based, computer-based understanding that created huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
In doing so, I'm encoded for prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, which stems from a data set that reflects the same humans, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
And I think about that technology, and I got to the point where I was in that day -- the first colour image was calibrated to a white woman's skin color, which means that color photography is different from black face.
And the same deviation, that blind spot, continued to lead into the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, is still in the application of facial recognition technology, how to recognize the faces of different people.
In today's research, I think of the most advanced technology, which tends to limit our thinking to one data set and one issue.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, which are further magnified when artificial intelligence is used.
And I realized at that time that we had to think deeply about what we're going to think about today, how we're going to invent creative technology in five to ten years.
In human interactions with the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
artificial intelligence, by contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
And that means it's really important, and we're going to have to think about it now -- reflect on our blind spots, and our prejudices, and how these prejudices affect the technology that we're creating now, and discuss what technology today means for the future.
The CEO and the scientists, they've weighed their ideas, about the future of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned, "Athletic intelligence destroys mankind."
Iron Mask warns that this is a risk that exists, and that is one of the greatest risks that we face as a civil society.
Bill Gates says, "I don't understand why people don't worry more about artificial intelligence."
But these ideas-- they're just part of the story.
And the math, the models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all that we can access and use.
We have source code tools open to the public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
Besides, we can also share our experiences.
We can share in technology and its relationship with us, and where we jump.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseen future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or, over time, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening the discussion of artificial intelligence and looking to the future, it will help create a conventional dialogue and consciousness, about what artificial intelligence is, and what it can be, and what we need to do, to achieve what's best for us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we've been using today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are, too.
They are not exactly the same.
Where you've seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we're now building and creating.
We've activated the domino effect, which opens the way to the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it shaped tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
Let us be immersed in the technology that enhances reality, to revive the world of the past.
Technology helps people to share their experiences when communication is difficult.
Technology built on online visual media can be used on autopilots.
Technology produces language based on image understanding, evolves into technology that helps people with visual impairments, helps them to have a better view of the world.
We also see how technology leads to a number of problems.
We have the technology today to analyze the physical properties of our birth -- the color of our skin or the look on our face -- to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on gender or race, to determine whether we have access to credit.
Everything we see now, just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, is a moment of evolution.
That means what we're doing now, it's going to affect the way things go, and it's going to go into the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve in a way, we need to define strategies and targets, and open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of human culture and environment.
Technology can help us cure nervous system diseases or other disabilities, making life as challenging as everyone else.
The operation of technology doesn't take into account your characteristics or your skin color.
I'm concerned today with technology tomorrow and 10 years later.
Artificial intelligence can occur in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned vehicle without any destination.
This is the car that we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not to turn.
We choose what an artificial intelligence will be in the future.
There'll be a vast arena, allowing artificial intelligence to become everything.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
Now it's up to us to figure out what needs to be done to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence are better for all human beings.
Thank you.

Black land “plant” out of agricultural modernization - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society Harbin, July 26th, Question: The Black Land's “Creation” is Modernizing Agriculture
In the summer, two spray planes ran over 10,000 acres of high-yield demonstration fields at the second operating station in the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the “first day of the world” in the green field, which was grown with black rice seedlings, became particularly visible.
The station's chief, the pore, said that such aircraft could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficiently than drones and hundreds of times more artificially.
This farm, located in the friendly county of Heilongjiang Province, the country's first food-producing province, has moved from the sound of past rice-cutting to the sound of today's “Long” Mada, where traditional Chinese farming and farms have mutated along the black belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernization of agricultural production on friendly farms.
Confucius described, on the one hand, their use of satellite remote sensing to achieve precision application, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution, and, on the other hand, their use of satellite navigation technology to increase the level of standardized operations in agricultural and aircraft fields.
During this year ' s rice production, the farm expanded the area of operation of satellite navigation UAV technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedling planting more evenly, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 dollars per acre in labour costs.
Farms have tried new technologies in agricultural production, such as informatization, intelligence etc., creating the country ' s largest group of agricultural machinery, from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently 49,000 farm machinery holdings, with an overall field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural machine operations resulted in 100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent intensive seeding in dry fields and 100 per cent operation of dry field large motor vehicles.
“Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture, digital agriculture are the way forward for the modernization of agriculture.”
The friendship farm leader, Liu Lien, said.
The key to the modernization of agriculture is scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, the Heilongjiang Farm, which is represented by farms, has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large agricultural “carriers” and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale farming, standardized production and industrialization.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is a 350,000 square metre agricultural machine fair.
There is a concentration of more than 140 agricultural tools that have been introduced and used over the years by the Heilongjiang Farm.
These agricultural tools and farms bear witness to the development of our agricultural modernization.

Xinhua Society, On July 26th, Xinhua, Question: If you live in a small house, Xinhua Xinhua Xinyu Xinhai Quanjiang Quanteng Quan Quan Quan Quan Quan
Xinhua News Agency journalist Chen Sang-jun, Wang Li-wu, Liu Sha Village
On 25 July, at around 4 p.m., Fu Quinbao wore mud-filled rubber shoes, went to the back of the house, and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Ying, to pack his things.
“I received a call from the village cadres to transfer, and I was still plowing grass in the fields.”
Fu Quinbao says he's been running over 60 acres of land, growing rice, and now he's growing up pretty good, and he's been taking his medicine yesterday, and he hasn't packed his tools.
Fu Quinbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants their house to be flooded, let's go home."
In response to the continued high-water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the lair lake, the city of Hefty, Anhui Province, is preparing to launch on 26 November the flood-water collection of the Jiangguchi River, where the family is located.
Chiangguchi is located in Fatsi County, adjacent to the lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the town of Yan Shui and the town of Miheu who need to be relocated.
As at 1600 hours on 25 February, our fifth-largest freshwater lake lair remained at an altitude of 13.2 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.7 metres.
The Fu Quinbao kitchen was clean and clean, with a bowl of pumpkin heads on the table, eggs and some halogenes in the fridge.
"I didn't think we'd move it, but the water at Chiang's mouth is still fine."
Zhou Ying said that the house was a flat house, and that some of the big items were not yet ready to be placed.
“Pack the valuables first, and the big ones, refrigerators, televisions, can be placed in the high-lying neighbours' or relatives' homes for the time being.”
The village cadre, Wang Quinbao, has taken care of Fu Quinbao.
Wang was responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family informed that the resettlement programme for each individual was confirmed.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Quinbao family is the Su Primary School, located in Tsang Town, about two kilometres away.
In addition to the big pieces, the headaches of Fu Quinbao included more than 1,000 pounds of food at home and some newly purchased furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to the relatives' house, and the furniture cannot be moved."
The couple agreed to put a stool under the newly purchased bed, raising the bed about half a metre high.
At 6 p.m., Fu Quinbao started transporting things to relatives in a tricycle, and Zhou Ying continued to pack at home.
At around 11 p.m., the couple looked around and around the house, pulled the switch and went to the settlement.
"I hope the water returns soon."
Fu Quinbao said that.
On 26 July, at 9:30 a.m., journalists observed at the Quantao site that preparations had been made for the flood.
Zhang Ji-Kolin's home team is strong with myo-Xinhua Network.
On 11 July, the sports teenager's hot-blooded competition show, " Sports Bar Kid " , officially landed on the south of Lake.
The sport leader, Zhang Jingqin, shares the same platform as the sports assistant, Lin Mansion, and Lindane and the Quantitude of the Quantico have styles, while the hard core of the Power Puller, which is a “big thing”, is on the ground, making the programme “fired”.
At the top of the list, 11 sports youths demonstrated their power races, as well as their appearance as live viewers, attention was paid to the “strong conflict” and “strength heart” of the arena.
Among them, the “strong conflict” came from SuperA sports student Giovanni, who, before the game, openly provoked Xu Ji-bin, known as the “beautiful man” in the same track, should have stunned Xu's appearance and even released the harsh words “lost the make-up”.
A word of silence has given the youth and sports leaders of the scene a cold breath.
Instead, “strength-to-power” is more like a fairy-to-peer fight, with the same power as the Great Demon King's Sun Kee-chee, in a strong battle.
And their identities are unexpected, and Kenji Sun is a gymnasium-loving actor, and Zhang Jing Dynasty is a retired SWAT soldier and three champions of the Order of Brave.
At the start of the race, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the poles quickly, and the protracted confrontation on the poles led to a sweating by the viewers on the scene.
In a tense situation, Zhang Jianko, one of the leaders of the Sports Bar Youth movement, was also watching the war seriously.
At the point of assessment, he was also very careful and patiently encouraged by the young people who lost the competition to help each of the failure points in the recall process.
The sports assistant's house, in turn, was a flower-like attack, and she did not hide her appreciation of the young people who were on-line with the power of face.
The day-to-day training of sports teenagers is all the more admirable when it comes to learning that they are overstretched.
The same exercise leader's lindane and the boudoir have styles, one for the rest of the world, the rest for the rest of the world, and the other for the evaporation of the tension with a smile.
In addition, Gikwung and Liu Quan, as sports assistants, have created a lot of laughs about sports teenagers.
The Fire of the Church of Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to arson, normal times and oligarchy - the new Chinese net.
According to the external media, on 18 July, the religious historic building of Nantes, the famous St. Peter and the St. Paul Cathedral, in France, was severely damaged in a fire and the organ was completely destroyed.
On 26 local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer, who was in charge of guarding the cathedral, had been charged with “burning and destruction”.
He has admitted that he set himself on fire in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Senas, stated that the 39-year-old diocese volunteer from Rwanda had admitted that he had lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
The lawyer for this person stated that the arsonists now regret doing so.
A few years ago, he entered France by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish of the site of the fire and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution stated that he had recently attempted to update his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
The church, however, stated that it was still unconvinced that the faithful, who were generally very kind and smiling, but who did not speak much, would destroy the church that he loved so much.
On the day of the 18 July fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for questioning and had been released because of the logical problems in his account.
The figure is for firefighters to rescue at the site.
On the evening of 25 December, the same person was summoned again as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers from the Central Police Laboratory in Paris.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It has been reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect may face a prison sentence of 10 years and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre ' s and St. Paul ' s Cathedrals, that the organ was completely burned and that the coloured window behind the organ was seriously damaged.
According to Brune, the chief architect of the French historical preservation architecture, it is conservative to estimate that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Combined message: U.S. unilateralism disrupts relations between the two countries, and international public opinion supports China's anti-American-Xinhua network.
On the morning of 24 July, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit to establish and operate the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific demands on the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States side and to take counter-measures.
Andrés Borges, Director of the Chinese Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States undermined the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and put the relations of the two great Powers in crisis.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a reaction to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and was consistent with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, Professor of the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Central American Studies, believes that the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the earlier provocations of the United States and is not directed against the ordinary American population.
The United States tries to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
The Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Centre of the Indonesian think tank, Bambang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic posture of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States and that relations between the two countries faced serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, in keeping with diplomatic practice, and reflects both China's principled position of firm defence of its own interests and the legitimate advantages and benefits of Chinese diplomacy.
The Tanzanian currentist Francis Semwenza said that the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocations of the United States.
To return to normal relations between China and the United States, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economic and political gains with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Arab-Chinese Federation of Friendship and Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustifiable actions of the American side, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as with diplomatic practice.
Previously, the United States called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in grave violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind its previous decisions and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
The Singapore Joint Morning News published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intent of the United States was to block China and prevent it from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States of America, China, which is very reluctant to see its relations continue to deteriorate, has had to take counter-measures.

Xinhua Guangzhou, a journalist with electricity on 26 July (journalist Mao) learned from the Guangdong Sea Police that, in recent days, the Xinhua Society, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, had dismantled a huge group of oil-smuggling products, which had been smuggling some 120,000 tons of oil since 2019, with a total value of about 800 million yuan yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Sea Police, in conjunction with the Customs Department, have progressively worked out the division of labour and structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, the customs and the public security services launched a unified collection network operation in Guangzhou, Fushan and the sea off the Pearl River. Four ships suspected of smuggling were seized on site, with a total of 4,700 tons of oil seized from the vessels and the oil depots involved, respectively, and a fund account was frozen.
The joint operation was known to have launched a total of eight naval vessels and two helicopters, divided into multiple operational teams, to combat the whole chain of smuggling by sea and illegal operations on land, all of which involved 35 major suspects.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant officers of the Guangdong Sea Police said that they would continue to maintain a high-pressure posture in the future to combat smuggling and criminal activities at sea and to maintain good order in the maritime areas of their jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna landed in Medell, or caused a flood of rivers and floods-- a new net.
On July 26, China-News Network reported that, at 5 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hanna landed in Texas, United States, at 25 p.m., causing heavy storms, river surges and potentially life-threatening flash floods in Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Centre, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of the southern and north-eastern parts of the state, which may have triggered some of the flooding and life-threatening flash floods.
The worst affected by hurricane Hanna is reported to be the area south of the city of Cops Christi to the mouth of the Grand River, where widespread flash floods may occur.
The Governor of Texas, Abbot, said on 25th, “Any hurricane is a great challenge”.
Thirty-two counties in the state were in a state of disaster as a result of the hurricane.
The city of Cops Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed down its libraries and museums, and its inhabitants are waiting.
Abet added that, at a time when Texas was suffering from the devastating effects of the new crown, the hurricane could not be allowed to cause more casualties in Texas.
In southern Texas, rainfall is reported to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night of 26 months, as well as 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and the coastal area of Louisiana.
As a result of global warming, among other factors, Hanna was formed earlier than in the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place in mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice indicated on Saturday that next week Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
According to the Polish right-wing Government Cabinet, the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, which violates the rights of parents.
A press conference was held by the Polish Minister of Justice, Jiablo, who said that the Ministry of Justice, which he headed, would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to begin withdrawing from the Treaty on Monday.
The Treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
According to Jiablo, “the treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider to be harmful”.
The law in power in Poland has a close alliance with the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church, promoting a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Douda made the issue of homophobic rights one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempatt, stated in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawal from the Treaty is to legitimize domestic violence”.
Some protesters carried banners, which read “The Law and Justice Party is the Hell of Women”.
The Party of Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland ' s previous centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Party for Law and Justice stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

The results of the President of Brazil's new coronary virus test were reversed - Xinhuanet
On 25 July in Brasilia, Xinhua, the Brazilian President, Bossonaro, announced on his personal social media account the negative results of his latest new coronary virus test.
In addition to the publication of the latest test results, Bossonaro published photographs of his hand-held hydrazine kit in social media.
Bossonaro has consistently maintained that the drug effectively treats the new coronary virus infection and has shown himself using the drug live on several occasions through social media.
According to the Brazilian media, Bosonaro announced the results of the virus test on the same day and travelled on a motorcycle to the capital, Brasilia, where he also met with a member of the House of Representatives.
Previously, Bossonaro had been separated from the Presidential residence.
The results of his 6-day test for the new coronary virus, announced on 7 July in a joint broadcast broadcast by various local media outlets, were positive, with two more tests, on 14 and 21.
Jiangxi opened a “green passage” for flood first-line youth to join the army - Xinhuanet
The recruitment office of the People ' s Government of Jiangxi province, Xinhua Society Nanchang, on 26 July (Go Dongming, Kuang Liang), has made it clear in recent days that priority will be given to conscripts to individuals or their children who have featured prominently in this flood disaster response mission, who are eligible for recruitment and who have qualified for medical and political examinations.
“After the registration of the young conscripts, we shall give priority to the recruitment of the conscripts after verification by the joint recruitment offices of the communities in which the young recruits are based, the Street Armed Department and the Quanyang District.”
Wang Fai, Deputy Minister of Man-Wu of Xiyang District, Xijiang City, said that, as a result of the floods, they had concentrated three days since 25 to organize a medical examination of the young recruits.
Xijiang City, a 22-year-old university graduate, was recruited by the youth Xiao Jianyang district, whose mother was a community worker, whose father was a veteran of one of the air forces, and whose parents had been on the line of duty to combat the flood for more than a decade.
“These days, as the news shows, the sons of the people are fighting to defend their homeland from the flood, and I want to be one of them.”
Cho said that he had had a military dream since he was a child, and his determination to go to the barracks was reinforced by the current flood response.
The city of Xijiang also uses the flood risk as a “live material” for military recruitment propaganda. They are community-based and call upon young recruits to participate voluntarily in the task of patrolling the Chati, on duty, etc., and are now aware of the nature of the People's Army and to strengthen their confidence in participating in the military.
Xijiang City's Xiaoyang District People's Political Committee, Goi Yu, said that it was to be hoped that, by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, more young recruits would be encouraged and a good social atmosphere would be created for the honour of participating in the mission and the glory of joining the army.
According to the Viet Nam News Agency, Grivali believes that Viet Nam has made a significant contribution to ASEAN development over the past 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivori stated that Russia and, indeed, the Asia-Europe Economic Union believed that Viet Nam had contributed to the advancement of ASEAN and the promotion of its image to the outside world.
He stressed that “ASEAN should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam”.
Grivori stated that the analysts had endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Viet Nam.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with the ASEAN countries and to propose constructive and peaceful measures on the issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia in the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperative relationship with ASEAN to help Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, and Viet Nam were able to enter the ASEAN market with the signing of the FTA.
Grivori proposes to maximize the expansion of the Free Trade Area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and the ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Grivori is convinced that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, the North River Province will be equipped with the necessary conditions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign capital inflows, in particular transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, the North River Province will be ready to submit to the Prime Minister of the Government his proposal for an investment in infrastructure development and business projects in the Viet Nam Industrial Zone and approve the addition of two industrial-urban-service zones in the province, Ansan-North and Anjoo, to be included in the overall plan for the development of the Viet Nam Industrial Zone by 2020.
At the same time, the North River Province has made efforts to accelerate progress on projects, in particular infrastructure development and operation projects in industrial parks, such as two streams in Fu, Guangzhou and the Queen, to generate land funds for business purposes.
In 2020, the Department of Industry and Trade of the North River Province provided input on the planning of industrial zones and clusters to be integrated into the provincial planning.
The North River Province has identified the development of clusters of industrial parks as a combination of national security, ecological protection and food security, thus contributing to balanced industrial development; and the availability of comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water, transport and telecommunications, as well as with urban construction, trade services, worker housing and other social infrastructure such as health care, education, etc.
In the industrial zones, the North River Province has made a strong appeal for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, ancillary industries, etc.
In the industrial park cluster, the province called for small- and medium-scale investment projects in the production, use of local labour, especially in the areas of agricultural products, food processing, etc.
In the future, North River Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the North River logistics centre, in tandem with the industrial park cluster, in order to optimize the flow of goods, money and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize the supply chain and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gun card - Xinhua Network for the first time out of the factory at the end of the year
Xinhua Society, Moscow, 25 July, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence's plan, the upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gun (hereinafter, Wuzheng) card-52 — the first conversion and release of K-52M — will be completed in December this year, and the model will be significantly upgraded in terms of detection, communications and weapon performance.
According to a recent Russian newspaper, Wuzhika-52M, known as the “Super Shorter Alligator”, was developed under a contract signed last April between the Russian military and the military and industrial units, and the first two upgrades are currently being replaced at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian “Progress” Aerospace Group, whose national tests and improvements will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian expert who was aware of the upgrading, the “forebears” of the “super-clinics” — a type of machine that was officially installed in November 2011 — revealed a number of weaknesses in its use, and this upgrade was designed to “remediate the board”.
It has been reported that K-52M, compared to K-52, will partially adopt new types of protective materials that do not add weight, and its pilot cabin will be reinforced with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of survival in the field; larger generators will be equipped to power more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; photovoltaic systems will be upgraded to detect and identify further distant battlefield targets; new light-use multi-purpose missiles, with a range of up to 20 kilometres, will be equipped with a range of about one times greater than the range of similar missiles used in active-duty UTO Russia; and their defensive weapons and communications equipment will be used to the maximum extent possible by Mi-28NM armed helicopters capable of attacking air targets, thus making the associated maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also indicated that it was of concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thereby obtaining in real time in the air information from nearby drones, such as the images taken by drones on the helicopter ' s cabin screen.
It is planned that the K-52M pilots will be able to directly manipulate the drones with which they work, thereby increasing their knowledge of the battlefield situation and their guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, in December last year the Russian Deputy Minister of Defence, Krivorucciko, stated that the Russian Ministry of Defence planned to purchase more than 110 martial arts cards-52M by 2027.
Under the new Act, the Campania Region is required to wear masks in public indoors as of this date, and the violation is punishable by a fine of up to Euro1,000.
On 1 June, local time, Rome, the Italian capital, the Roman Ordnance Field, was reopened.
According to reports, according to the latest quarantine decree issued by the Regional Government, the people of the Campania region are required to wear masks in compliance with the quarantine requirements in all public transport, as well as in access to indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and galleries.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to Euro1,000.
At the same time, the Act provides for the segregation of all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region.
The regional government will authorize the health agencies to coordinate the organization of specific hotels for the isolation of the positive non-symptoms.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket received fines.
In Hebei, 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of the river ' s lake since this year - Central New Network
Xinhua Society Ishijia's 26 July electrician (journalist Wang Qun) learned from the Hebei Province Water Department that, since this year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological water recharges to 28 rivers and white-oceanic deposits, including the Xinhua River, the Tang River, the Rejection of the Ma River and others, using a combination of water from the Hebei River and the local reservoir, and has cumulatively completed 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological water from the river lake.
Hebei has seized the advantage of increasing the flow of water through the Northern South Water Central Line project and has implemented ecological rehydration using the rivers of Tang, Sand and Dragon.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including the Western Ocean, East Wouss, and the rivers of the White Ocean, such as the Shaoyang River and the Blue Dragon River, were used for ecological recharge, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometres.
In order to achieve ecological water recharge, the Hebei Department of Water Affairs has been active in organizing the detection, rehabilitation and consolidation of riverine hazards and the clean-up of river lanes, refining practical measures and strengthening patrol and surveillance.
The timely resolution of problems through supervised inspections and concentrated unannounced visits ensured the safe and orderly recharge of rivers.
According to the relevant head of the Hebei Department, the orderly implementation of the river lake eco-rehydration, the effective restoration of the river and lake ecosystems in Hebei Province, the promotion of the recharge and nutrients of the coastal groundwater, and the significant improvement of the habitat and economic development environment along the route are important for the conservation of the management of the river and lake, which are “water-clean, green, river-fast and beautiful”.
You should all know what I'm talking about.
I think the intuition that inequality can cause social division and corruption predates the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing societies with societies with different degrees of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are relevant.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I wanted to start my presentation with a paradox.
This graph shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and our gross national income, which measures the average wealth of a country.
You can look at the countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, twice as rich as the countries on the left, Israel, Greece, Portugal.
But this does not affect the life expectancy of their nationals.
There are no interrelated signs.
But if we're going to know what's going on within society, we're going to find that there's a great difference in health within their society as a whole.
This map still shows life expectancy.
These are the towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There is a great difference between the poor and others.
Even those at the top, whose health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but comparisons between societies make no sense.
The paradox is that, in our society, we look at relative income, or social status, identity -- our interrelationship, and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think, "What happens if the gap widens? What happens if the gap narrows? What happens if the gap widens or reduces the income gap?"
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- just like the World Bank -- and it's about the income gap between these rich, developed, and democratic countries.
The way we use it, easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the income gap between the previous 20 percent and the subsequent 20 percent for each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and their previous 20 percent wealth is about 3.5 to 4 times the later 20 percent.
But on the other side of the more unequal side — the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, Singapore — the income gap is double.
In this way of comparison, the inequality in our country (the United Kingdom) is twice as high as in other equally successful democratic markets.
I'm going to show you what this has to do with our society.
We've collected data on the problems caused by intra-social differences, which are more prevalent at the bottom of the society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, child mathematics and language performance, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population ratio, teenage pregnancy rate, level of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all of this in a coefficient.
They're all weighted on average.
The score for a country is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are more relevant to the inequality that I've just shown, and I'll show them over and over again.
The more unequal countries are, the worse they are on social issues.
The correlation is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita national income and the gross national income index, then you'll find nothing, no more relevance.
We have a little concern that people might think that we've chosen specific issues to suit our theory and then created artificial evidence, so we also published a paper in the British Journal of Medicine on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.
It contains 40 different parts, from other people's summaries.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books in their homes, how many immunization rates, and whether there are bullying in schools.
All included.
This is the relationship between the index and the same degree of inequality.
The more unequal societies, the worse the performance of children.
Relationships and their visibility.
But again, if you look at the welfare of the child in relation to per capita national income, you'll get nothing.
All the data I'm showing you right now reveal the same thing.
The average well-being of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position vis-à-vis others seems very important today.
And I'm going to show you some of the sections of our index.
This is a mutual trust index.
It means the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15 percent of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more egalitarian society, this percentage rises to 60% or 65%.
If we look again at the level of community participation or the assessment of social capital, there's a very similar correlation with inequality.
I would like to say that we have repeated that work twice.
The first was for these rich and developed countries, and then we changed the subject of the test, and this test was repeated to the 50 states of the United States -- the same question: Are the more unequal states, the worse in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality that the federal government has created in a general social survey.
Very similar scatters are distributed in similar levels of trust.
The same thing goes on.
Basically, we found that almost all the elements of mutual trust reflected in the international survey are also reflected in the 50 states we're investigating separately.
This is not a coincidence.
This is a picture of mental illness.
The World Health Organization, by random sampling, uses the same diagnostic interview method to collect data that allows us to compare the rate of mental illness in every society.
This is the percentage of the population with any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It's ranged from 8 per cent to more than 24 per cent -- which suggests that the proportion of mental illness in society as a whole is three times higher than in other societies.
Similarly, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
The red dots represent the states of the United States, the blue triangle means the provinces of Canada.
But look at the number of them.
Murder rates ranged from every million to 150.
This is the ratio of prison inmates.
This is 10 times the difference, and the index function magnifies the difference.
But the changes in the prison population range from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, the crime can explain part of the cause.
But more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more inequality society becomes, the more it tends to retain the death penalty.
This is a picture of children dropping out of high school.
Similarly, there are wide disparities.
If we talk about the selection of people in society, we'll find that this gap is very dangerous.
This map shows the rate of social mobility.
It's actually based on the income flow rate.
Basically, what it's asking is, do rich dads have rich kids, poor dads have poor kids, or is there nothing between them?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, Britain, the United States.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There are more social movements.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've already shown it here in italics.
I can also show some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with the social gradient, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but two times 10 times less than anything.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I'd like to go back to this map that we've shown earlier and we'll combine all of it to illustrate two things.
First, through a copy of the chart, we find that the less performing countries, whatever they are, seem to be the more unequal countries, but the better performers seem to be the Nordics and the Japanese.
So what we see is the relationship between widespread social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
And another very important point I'd like to point out in this graph is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in every way that they're very different countries.
The status of women, their commitment to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has great differences in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc. to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, the pre-tax wage gap in Japan is relatively small.
It's less taxed.
Its benefits are also relatively low.
And in the study of the states of the United States, we found a stark contrast.
There are states that perform well through redistribution, and there are states that do well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we came to the conclusion that it's not important how to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve it.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm talking about real democracies in rich, developed markets.
Another unexpected thing about this map is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
John Dorne seems to have a point: "No one is an island."
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in different countries with more or less equality.
This is just one example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the general socio-economic classification of England, some Swedes are very kind in classifying many infant deaths.
It's an anachronistic classification based on paternity, so single mothers make their own set of data.
But we look at the so-called "low class of society," which is manual work without technology.
The middle is the need for skilled manual work, and then high-level non-manual work, up to professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
And here we can see that Sweden is doing better than Britain, and doing better at every level of society.
The greatest differences occur at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data, including the results of education in the United States and internationally, as well as health.
It seems that overall - a more equal society displays the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but there are also some advantages at the upper levels of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
More concerned with the feeling of superiority and inferiority, valued and despised, respected and devalued.
Of course, those feelings that arise from the competitive status of status have driven social consumerism forward.
But it also leads to a lack of certainty of status.
What worries us more is how others judge and view us, whether we seem attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluation reinforces the fear of evaluating these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of sociopsychology is also going on: some people have looked at 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers are invited to a psychological testing centre and then test their stress hormones and their reaction to stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is most likely to raise the level of cortex ol in the body, the most important of which is Hormon.
The result is precisely those tasks that include the threat of social evaluation -- those that threaten self-esteem and social status -- in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stressors have very special effects in stress physiology.
We have now accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like it, and some people find it surprising.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data from the countries being observed, then we'll include it in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, deviations will occur.
What about the rest of the world?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries here, hiding a simple proof.
The same country, the same inequality measurement, the problem one after another.
Why don't we control the other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
And of course, there are others who apply more sophisticated methods in the literature that exclude poverty, education, etc. in experiments.
How's the causality?
Relevance does not in itself prove a causal link.
It took us quite a while.
Indeed, there is a good understanding of the causal link between our outcomes.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important the long-term pressure from society is for immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason that violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being despised.
I'm going to say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of post-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income, curb the top income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I want to conclude is that we can improve our true quality of life by reducing our income gaps.
In that case, we'll find out that suddenly we've solved the problem of the psychosocial well-being of society as a whole, and that's great.
Thank you.

In the past two weeks, the number of new confirmed cases in Spain has risen significantly, with thousands of new cases occurring over the past two weeks.
On the evening of Saturday, 25 July, the British Government provisionally decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from its 26th local time at 0000 p.m. and to keep persons from Spain in the United Kingdom isolated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried and even angry at the decision, because the news came as unexpectedly as it was.
The British Minister of Transport, Grant Shapps, is also reported to be on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the British quarantine measures, Norway had also announced 10 days of isolation for persons returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon the programme of vacations in and around Barcelona.
Beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distances between people cannot be maintained, and the police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain.
Spain: This is safe.
In response to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha González Laya, stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for the Spanish, but also for tourists."
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British Government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the rate of infection in the two tourist resorts is much lower than in the British mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalan region of Spain has also reactivated the "stop order".
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain, which is one of the most favoured resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a significant impact on the tourism industry in Spain.

Xinhua Net, the first day of the winter, the first day of the winter, the first day of the summer in Beijing.
Xinhua's Xinhua agency, Beijing, 26 July, was the first day of the year of the “mid-volvo” of Xinhua's electricity (journalist Nie Wonjin).
In the early morning of the 26th, the storm of the storm swung the weather, dissipating the heat and the heat of the day that has beset the Beijing area, and the new rains will continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station released a report at 1100 hours on 26 June that there were scattered showers (with weak lightning) in Beijing with a maximum daily temperature of only 27°C; at night, there was small to medium rain (with weak lightning), and at night the lowest temperature was 23°C.
From 24 to 25 years ago, the entire city of Beijing was at high temperature blue warning, with the highest daily temperatures in most regions at around 37°C, with temperatures exceeding 40°C.
The weather is one of the highest temperatures, humid and hot days of the year, with three volts of the year and the hottest in the middle, as Chinese people call it the bitter summer.
At the time of the ambush, the house was filled with barns, and there was a popular claim that “one dumpling had a double face”.
According to current forecasts, in the next three days, the weather in Beijing will be cloudy.
The meteorological sector alerts the public to minimize mountain play and to guard against geological hazards.
It is understood that this year's “mid-bust” lasted 20 days, beginning on 26 July and ending on 14 August.
When entering a “mid-volt”, people feel physically weak and hungry.
The choice of food in the diet, such as green beans, gins, which has the effect of heat-free summer, spleen appetizers, and bitter food, such as chords, can contribute to increased appetite and the elimination of the summer gas.
The engine may be out. FAA has an emergency order for 2,000 Boeing passenger aircraft, Xinhuanet.
The United States Federal Aviation Office (FAA) issued an emergency seaworthiness directive on 24 December, which required an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, as the air revalves of the passenger aircraft in question were corrupted and could result in engine parking.
According to the Federal Aviation Office, four reports of air parking of passenger engines 737 NG and 737 Classic have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requirements for passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for passenger aircraft that have thus far flown less than 11 times after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Office warned that if all two passenger engines were corroded, the level 5 valves could be stuck in open positions, causing the plane to lose all power and to be unable to re-invigorate the motive.
This aviation regulatory body ordered that, once a corrosion of the revalve was detected, the air operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft was re-used.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new coronary disease had led to lower demand for travel, which had resulted in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or less used, and that “retarding valves are more vulnerable to corrosion”.
Boeing also stated that it had been recommended that air operators inspect passenger aircraft covered by the directive and that, if problems were identified, Boeing would provide assistance in such areas as repair and replacement of the return valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft under the flag of the major air operators in the United States usually fly several times in one day, but that, following the outbreak of the new crown, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; as the demand for passengers had grown slowly in recent times, a number of passenger aircraft had returned to operation.
The Federal Aviation Office did not issue details of the four air parking reports.
One of these incidents was revealed later in 24 days by Alaska Airlines.
In its statement, the air operator stated that on 15 July, a passenger aircraft under the flag flew from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, an engine suddenly went off and the passenger aircraft finally made an emergency landing at Austin airport.
Alaska Airlines stated that the engines of the passenger aircraft had been replaced and that the engines of the six passenger aircraft had been checked in accordance with the Federal Aviation Authority ' s directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Air, respectively, stated that there had been no engine shutdowns in the passenger aircraft under the flag associated with the air stop valves.
Four passenger aircraft under the United States Airlines flag will be inspected, and 28 under the United Airlines flag will be inspected.
Damen Airlines stated that it would inspect 20 passenger aircraft under the flag, but did not indicate whether there had been any engine fires.
In many media reports, the Federal Aviation Office ' s emergency seaworthiness directive was another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX passenger aircraft of Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, resulting in a total of 346 deaths.
This series of passenger aircraft, which was followed by a global shutdown, came to a halt in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, the President of the Federal Aviation Authority, Steve Dixon, admitted that the Federal Aviation Authority had made “a mistake” in regulating Boeing in the case of the 737 MAX passenger aircraft.
Ding Bang On the Line! Teacher's good to go on the line next week, with the title Xue Mo Fong, "Knowledge Launcher - Xinhua Network."
There's a new art on the line.
An interactive knowledge-sharing programme, Ding Bang On! How are you, will be aired on the Hunan Vigilance from 20 July.
It is understood that the programme will create a new all-age youth class, with a pool of talented and talented teachers coming forward to challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impressions of the past group of teachers in the minds of the general public, Ding Bang On the Line! Teacher Good gathered a group of intellectual representatives of both face and talent.
They are both youth intellectual role models from various disciplines, and a group of enthusiasts who shake their loads and are masters of euphemism.
In the programme, these excellent youth knowledge role models, as “knowledge-sharing officers”, will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience through an attitudinal knowledge output, showing the most interesting aspects of their discipline.
In turn, an all-age viewer's “advocacy” site raises the question of variability, makes it more difficult for the “knowledge-sharing officer” to teach, and adds a somewhat stimulating atmosphere to the programme.
It has been revealed that among the “knowledge-sharing officers” are excellent young teachers, such as Lee Young Lok, a secondary school physics teacher attached to the Chinese People's University, Zhang Xue Feng, and Wang Jing, a history teacher with 10 years of professional experience, who will show the field viewers their “hard nuclear” knowledge in unexpected ways.

Secretary of State, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: critical situation
Xinhua Society, Hong Kong, 26 July, Jianjong Zhang, Director General of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, 26 July, stated that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be critical and that, in the event of a reversal of the epidemic, the HKSAR Government will decisively take stricter control measures to further restrict the operation of the business premises and reduce the number of spaces available to the public.
At this stage, however, it is not the intention of the HKSAR Government to introduce “home orders” or “restriction orders” to restrict the movement of citizens.
On the same day, Zhang Jianjong published a post entitled "The Critical Situation: A Full Fight Against the Epidemic".
He said that the epidemic, the worst in six months, would be critical in the next two weeks to do everything possible to prevent the further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, self-regulation and cooperation by the public are also important.
He called on citizens to remain at home as much as possible, to reduce social contact and to go out to eat.
Citizens should cooperate with the coercive measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and focus on personal and environmental health and manual handwashing, in particular by suspending non-necessary family and friends meetings or meals and reducing them to street markets.
He stated that the Central Government has been keenly interested in the evolution of the epidemic in Hong Kong and has supported the HKSAR Government's efforts to combat the epidemic, and has responded positively to the latest request of the Chief Executive to assist with the enhancement of detection capabilities and the adaptation of the International Expo in Asia for work similar to that of the “class hospital”.
According to Jianjong Zhang, the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, i.e. residential homes, homes with disabilities and nursing homes, restaurants, taxi drivers and property managers, has been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, where the Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centres.
He indicated that the Government of the District was in the process of constructing quarantine facilities near the Quarantine Centre in Bamboo Bay, located on the New Territories Hill, and that an additional 700 quarantine units were expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19 that the HKSAR Government would construct an additional 2,000 isolation houses at the Bamboo Bay Quarantine Centre, with the aim of completing it by the end of the year.
Adding to the 800 already operational quarantine centres, the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation units by the end of the year.
There are currently four operating quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 isolation units.
In addition, on 24 April, the HKSAR Government reopened the Carpgate Park Resort on Hong Kong Island as a community-based isolation facility for patients under the age of 50 who are self-sufficient.
"Neugenics" in the history of the Puppet Party, the history of the New China - the New China Network
Source: People's Forum Network.
Recently, Secretary-General Xi Jinping, during his visit to the Quartet memorial, stressed that “the history of the Communist Party of China, the history of the New China, should be well studied by 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million members of the party, especially leaders at all levels.”
Carefully studying the history of the Party, the history of the New China, is a mandatory lesson for the Party ' s cadres, keeping in mind their original purpose and mission, from which they must learn the rich and nourishing of their families and take the long journey of the new era.
A vast party history, the history of the New China, which records the hard struggles and glorious journeys of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrates the original heart and mission of the Communists, whose beliefs and loyalty were forged with life and blood.
History is the best textbook, and for party cadres the party history, the New China history, is the best chapter of this textbook.
Every party cadre is constantly strengthening its historical thinking of history and the way forward, building on the new mission of the new journey, taking on the “celebrator” of the times, and taking the long journey of the present generation.
In the history of the Party, in the history of the New China, the spirit of the past held its original mission.
The history of the Party, the history of the New China, full of the immutable original mission of the Communist Party of China and the steadfastness of its conviction as a rock, has revealed the pristineness of the Communists to be with their people forever.
Close knowledge of party history, the important events of the history of the New China, important conferences, important figures, not only the intuitive shock of the mind, the baptism of the mind, but also the deep-seated reading of the content of the first heart ' s faith and the weight of the mission.
For the party cadres, in order to continue to pursue their original mission and to develop their own identity, it is necessary to find from the history of the party, the history of the new China the point of departure, the point of departure, the point of support of the original heart, to maintain a sobering awareness and a firm position, to stir up the strength of the struggle of the nation for its people, and to ensure that the blood and life of the revolution's ancestors will be passed on to the generations of the Red River.
It is wise to learn history and to pass on a noble spirit in the history of the Party, the history of the New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of the Ini Okayama, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yanan, the spirit of the resistance, the spirit of Sipapo, the spirit of the "two-play-one-star" and the spirit of space have shaped a series of great spirits.
These great spirits, which have been sunk by history, provide a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome the risks and challenges on the way forward. They are a precious spiritual asset that cannot be broken, broken and robbed of.
The process of learning the history of the Party, the history of China is the process of tempering and self-constructing these spirits, consciously mirroring the noble spirits of the ancestors of the Revolution, maintaining the spiritual homeland of the Communists, building solid spiritual foundations for the advancement of great causes and the realization of great dreams, and giving new light to the times.
He studied history, and learned the history of the Party and the history of the New China.
For party cadres, there has never been a history that can bring a more profound warning, inspiration and lesson than the history of the party, the history of the New China.
In the history of the Party, the history of the New China, we can see the great deeds of the old Revolutionaryists who have dedicated themselves to their faith and struggle to achieve the goals set, as well as the profound lessons of certain people who, because of their idealistic beliefs, have moved to the opposite side of the Revolution. We have been inspired and warned that with firm determination and will we will never stand, never ceaseless, and that we always have a strong spirit of struggle and constant purity of party nature and physical discipline.
To truly be a strong believer and faithful practitioner of the great ideals of communism, it is necessary to remove the idea of “dust” and to prevent the “spoiling” of the body, and the history of the party, the history of the new China, should be the basis for every cadre of party members to examine and warn themselves.
Known of history and inspired by history, the time has come to challenge the history of the Party, the history of the New China.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping has stated that “the history of the Party, the history of the nation, is a compulsory subject for the adherence to and development of the socialism of the Chinese character and for the advancement of the Party and the country's causes”.
Looking back at history and prostrating for the first time, it is for the sake of renewed glory and for the future.
Each party official should use the history of the Party, the history of the New China as a lifelong quest, constantly setting the course of his or her life, taking up his or her historic mission, taking responsibility and acting proactively in his or her work.
Relying on the historical advances of the old revolutionary family, constantly polishing the political identity of the Communists, keeping up the vagaries, the struggle gestures and the more difficult it is to move forward, and writing its own illustrious piece in the course of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
"Chang Nam" in pursuit of the poetic "Yellow Dream" - the new Chinese net
♪ The Yellow River Dream ♪
On July 26, Sino-City's Sino-Congregation (Yandi) called "The Nine Yellow Rivers in Mandarin."
The Yellow River, which has inspired so many human beings, has given birth to a beautiful and rich plain of Ningxia, a beautifully known as the “Seong Gang south” who now adheres to the concept of “eco-priority, green development” and pursues the poetic “Yellow River Dream”.
"Bippo Dreams" by the Qing Shui Show.
The Yellow River, Funing Summer, which runs 397 kilometres through Ningxia, is the “Mother's River” that feeds one side.
However, with rapid industrialization and urbanization, river and lake exploitation and management have been uneven in protecting and protecting, and the disruptions, such as overstretched discharges, cropping around lakes, misappropriation of waters, have led to black odour, excessive water quality, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is pushing for the restoration of the diversity of water and is trying to return the Yellow River to the Qing River.
The water has to be treated from the source.
In Xinxia, the local approach of “pointing + remediation + squeezing” led to the complete centralization of sewage from industrial parks, the full realization of standard level A discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants, the virtual elimination of black and stinky water bodies from urban built-up areas, and the successful declaration of the third batch of Chinese black and stinky water demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia, with its full implementation in 2017, has now achieved full coverage of the system of five-tier river and lake liability in the districts and districts, and has become the norm.
He lived in a village by the Yellow River, 64 years old, and witnessed the change of the Yellow River: “The previous water stenched and the odor ran out after the clean-up”.
Gu said that the environment was better and his life easier, and now he goes for a walk by the Yellow River with his family and feels the blue sky.
"Wetland Dreams" by Sand gulls.
The beauty of the flying birds, green trees, storks, bouquets and bouquets ... The beauty of the swarm of sand gulls under Fan has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Ningxia and Shinchuan.
Through Ningxia, yellow rivers form a variety of wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, etc., which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, as well as serving as an important international migration route for birds.
Since 2009, the Ningxia sector has invested cumulatively in the wetland conservation project in the order of RMB 3450 million. Currently, the area of the Sinakawa wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, the wetland conservation rate is 78.5 per cent, there are nearly 200 natural lakes, marsh wetlands, five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
The Deputy Director of the Humidland Conservation Centre of the City of Silvan, Lu Jinhu, told journalists that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, particularly in birds, “the gull is a endangered bird, with more than 20,000 birds in the world, of which more than 2,000 are sheltered in the Swain River wetlands”.
At the same time, Ningxia, in accordance with the law, has drawn a red line between 500 metres of wetland protection in the Yellow and Galaxy sector, stipulating that no unit or individual may engage in development and operation within the scope of the protection, except for projects of public interest.
The Deputy Director of the Water Service Centre of Silver River City, Zhao Shao Yong, introduced the development of Class IV water quality through pollution source management, integrated management of river lake ecology and end-of-end wetland construction in Ningxia, which is now 100 per cent of the main yellow drain, “now the water is clean, fish is swimming, and flowers are blooming.”
The "drinking water dream" for all people.
Ningxia used to have an “indulgent” title: the only city along the yellow city, “drinking with water from the Yellow River”.
From 2010 onwards, the city began to face persistent water shortages at the peak of the summer, and the “water shortage pain” of nearly a decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents, but the water shortage has become a problem for the city in the face of over-exploitation limits in the major water sources, where large areas of groundwater over-crowded areas have been built under urban areas.
As a result of improved yellow river water quality, the drinking of purified yellow river water has become the solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director-General of the Water Authority of Silver River City, explained that, in order to improve the production of water for rural and urban residents of Silvergawa, Ningxia had, in due course, launched a water supply project along the rural and urban west lines of the Silvergawa Metropolitan Circle, replacing the original groundwater sources with high-quality yellow water.
“On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially brought water to the third district of the city of Shinchuan, and in 2020 the residents of Guanning and Herland districts also drank yellow river water.”
Ding Ming said that the Galaxy water sector would take an integrated approach to regional rural water and urban water supply integration, “the next step will be to integrate rural and decentralized water points and fully connect to the West Line water supply, which is expected to be largely integrated in rural and urban areas by the end of this year”.
Strengthening disaster prevention and response in all sectors - the new Chinese network
Increased preparedness of departments to respond to disasters
On-line news (News): Information from the Ministry of Water, today (25 July), at 1200 hours, the river under the Wang Huai River dam is at 0.64-3.31 metres, the river under the middle and lower Yangtze River is at 0.05-2.02 metres, and the lake is at 0.05-2.02 metres.
Tai Lai has been in existence for 28 days since 28 June.
Today, at 1200 hours, the average water level of the Lake is 4.67 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.02 metres.
Today, the General Conference of National Defence agreed to continue to maintain the Yangtze, Huai River II level response, demanding local accountability and further implementation of disaster prevention and response efforts.
Today, the National Defence Office, the Ministry of Emergency Management and Emergency Management are urgently deploying specialized flood trucks from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as the urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States undervalued China's countervailing survey with the renminbi.
In response to a recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation into strap (beam belt) products originating in China, as well as an investigation into the “undervalued currency exchange rate” project.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that this was the first time that the United States had investigated the so-called “underestimation of the renminbi exchange rate” project in the case of anti-subsidization neutrality, which China firmly opposes.
In particular, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a press release in this regard on the evening of 23 March, in which it stated that China had adopted a system of managed floating exchange rates based on market supply and demand, regulated by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market played a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the RMB exchange rate was at a reasonably balanced level and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of more than 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the effective renminbi exchange rate appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49 per cent, the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies globally.
The Department of Commerce noted that the issue of exchange rates went beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February of this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations into foreign exchange rates, which are suspected of violating WTO rules and have been subject to multiple objections.
The press release stated that, even under United States regulations, the applicant ' s claims were subject to numerous errors and lacked the necessary countervailing elements of financial support, grant of benefits and exclusivity.
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called “undervalued currency exchange rate”.
As a result of the further escalation of tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and offshore RMB against the United States dollar for a period of 22 days has been devalued, with a double drop of US$ 1 against RMB 7.0.
It is a matter of concern whether the United States Department of Commerce intends to push the renminbi.
The renminbi went up to 7.0 on the 23rd day of the current exchange price against the United States dollar and was collected at 6.9961.
The officially regulated median exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar was reduced by 17 basis points on 24 days, at 6.9938.
As the epidemic gradually improves, the film industry, which has been silent for almost six months, is returning to normal.
The day before, the 26th Shanghai Television Festival Convening Committee published the short-listed list of candidates for the Award.

The “Best Man and Woman” award has always been one of the main focuses of the outside world, and this year's competition has also been intense, with both male and female performers in the ranks of the elite, and the “Best Man” contest between Chen, Huang, Le Gian, Sun Hong Lei and Zhang.
Chen Po Guo, Huang and Sun Hong Lei are highly qualified middle-aged actors, as well as 37-year-old Le Chia-yung, and 32-year-old Zhang Joo-yung is the youngest entryist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Xiao Xiao won the best male actor in the White Jade Lane Award with the " Xingg " , and this year Zhang would refresh the record if he were to win over the other seniors.
The struggle of the best female protagonists also ended with a small wave of traffic among female actors in the film industry of Hai Qing, Mai Xing, Qin Haigu, Sun Xiao, and Xin Ni.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Xing came into the house on the basis of "At home" — her sixth nomination for the award — and in 2014 and 2016 she was “the best actress” on the basis of the "Mother of the Year" and the "Mother of the Moon" respectively.

The Venezuelan Foreign Minister accused the United States of fabricating an unprovoked attack on China - Xinhuanet.
Aréyassa said that the Government of the United States had recently exerted constant political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion pressure on China, which was an unwarranted attack on a sovereign State.
Aréaza transmitted the tweets and comments of the Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela, Li Baoyong, published on his personal account earlier that day.
In his tweet, Li Bao Yung said that China strongly condemned the forcible entry of the United States into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which constituted a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Chinese-American Treaty on Consular Relations, to which China will respond in a legitimate and necessary manner.
Government officials such as Rodríguez, Vice-President of Venezuela, Carlos Long, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of North America, prominent social figures and mainstream media journalists also transmitted the tweets of Li Bao-Wung, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
26, the day before the fifth State of the Nation address (SONA) by President Duarte of the Philippines, the cumulative number of new coronary pneumonia cases diagnosed in the Philippines amounted to 80,000, with an increase in the number of cases among staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its immediate agencies to 25.
To this end, PCOO has prepared a working group that has not been contacted by the accredited staff, in coordination with President Duarte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal gave an interview with DZBB Radio on 26th, indicating that two packages of the SONA formula have been prepared for President Duarte.
According to Plan A, during the afternoon of 27 Durt will publish SONA in the building of the Congress of the Philippines (Batasang Pambansa) in Quezon City.
As a result of the epidemic, only 50 seats have been set aside for some members of the Government Cabinet and legislators, and a separate video conference room has been set up for other Cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants in the conference were able to enter the National Assembly building on the same day through rapid testing.
Once one of the participants tested positive, plan B was launched, whereby President Duarte published SONA at the Presidential Palace in Malakal, with fewer listening seats on the scene.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the country in real time.
At the time of the submission, the Presidential Office of Fé had not confirmed whether the family of Durt would be present at SONA.
Andal said that President Duarte ' s SONA would focus on how the Government would lead the Philippines in its response to the neo-crowd pneumonia epidemic and in its socio-economic recovery; it would also mention his commitment to anti-government corruption, the fight against illegal drugs and poverty reduction.
Durert will also describe other plans of the current administration, including the creation of more jobs, the revitalization of the economy, the promotion of education, and assistance to overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.

Xinhua Society's Sino-Wankawa electricity on 26 July (journalist Alfome) was affected by the epidemic, and Ningxia's city kindergarten has not yet been reopened, particularly with increased pressure on private kindergarten funding, which has had an impact on the stability and future continued development of the kindergarten teaching staff.
In response to this, the City of Sinakawa has supported the stabilization of the teaching staff of non-inclusive private kindergartens through a number of measures, such as the provision of subsidies for them, the provision of job stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and the reduction of rents for private kindergartens.
In accordance with the relevant policies of the City of Sinakawa, during the period of the epidemic, the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been converted into inclusive after the administration of the municipal districts) pay the teaching staff a monthly subsistence allowance of not less than US$ 1660 per person per month, in line with the three district minimum wage rates, and the municipal budget allocates a six-month subsidy to cover the salaries of teachers and social insurance costs, in accordance with the standard of US$ 1,000 per child per child per year for inclusive private kindergartens.
In the case of non-inclusive private kindergartens, which are also provided to the teaching staff for a monthly payment of not less than $1.660 basic living costs per person, the City of Sinakawa will arrange a six-month subsidy for the maintenance of the post allowance for early childhood teachers at the rate of 500 yuan per child per year.
At the same time, in the case of privately run kindergartens with State-owned assets, the City of Sinakawa will reduce the rent of three months of housing during the period of control of the epidemic and encourage other categories of renters, such as developers, to assume social responsibility, as well as the rent of the kindergarten, which will be reduced by more than three months, and the related tax fees, as stipulated in the policy.
The Yangjiang flood No. 3 of 2020 formed the water department's detailed physical response - the China-New Network.
On 26 July, Xinhua, Xinhua, Xinhua, Xinhua, called on Xinhua, the 26th of July (journalist Hu Xuan), flood No. 3 of 2020 formed the Yangtze.
During the 26th meeting, the Minister of Water requested that the three gorge reservoirs be carefully deployed, that the water from the upper Yangtze and the Toyako lake be considered in an integrated manner, that the wrong peaks be carried out, that the reservoir be left to prepare for a possible major flood, and that the flood protection of the central and downstream dry currents and the important embankment of the Toyako be ensured.
Heavy rains are forecast for the next three days in the south-west, south-south-west, north-south-south-east and parts of the south-east of the river, south-east of the lake, central Guangxi, etc., with heavy rains in the north-east of the lake, south-west of the river, and in the centre-west of the north of the country, with heavy rains in the centre of the river.
The Ministry of Water expects, as a result of its influence, that the flow of inflow into the three canyon reservoirs in the upper river may reach about 60,000 cubic metres per second by 28 days, and that the water level of the mid-dry-flowing Lotus ponds and the Toyako lake will rise again and be overprotected by about 0.20 metres; that the dry-flowing water level in the river will generally slow down and that the water level in the lake will continue to rise; and that rivers such as the Great elixir system of the river, the River Yongding, etc., will undergo a water booming process.
Aohei suggested that the Huai River basin should further increase the discharge of the flood, reduce the level of the lake as soon as possible, in preparation for a possible major flood.
There is a need to respond adequately to the floods in the water system.
He said that the e-Lake Basin should continue to increase its out-of-dwelling capacity, reduce the water levels of the e-Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible and reduce the risks to the e-Lake ' s high water levels and typhoons.
In addition, he stressed that flooding in northern areas, such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei, had surged and fallen, with short warning times and high vulnerability to landslides, which made it difficult to defend against them, and that there were a large number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams and security risks.
58 APPs against users have been exposed to more than a dozen listed companies - the China-New Network.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications informed that, in accordance with such laws and regulations as the Cybersecurity Act, the Telecommunications Regulations, the Regulations on the Protection of the Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet Users, and others, a third-party testing agency had recently been organized to inspect mobile phone applications and to supervise the restructuring of enterprises with problems.
The problems of this 58 APP include the private collection of personal information, over-extensive collection of personal information, frequent requests for authority, over-require of authority, difficulties with account write-offs, private sharing with third parties, denial of authority, etc.
The Ministry of Information and Communications requested that the implementation of 58 APP be completed by 30 July and that, if it is overdue, the Ministry organize the relevant disposals in accordance with the law.
New and mid-latitude journalists combed it out and found that the 58 APPs behind the circulars involved more than a dozen United States, port and A share listing companies.
For example, “many houses” are products of companies listed on the United States stock market, with five major problems of private collection of personal information, over-extensive collection of personal information, private sharing to third parties, mandatory use of targeted push functions by users, and frequent requests for privileges.
According to public sources, more houses than landed on NASDAQ in November 2019, “the real estate intermediary of the country's first industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model”, providing online solutions to a large number of intermediaries.
In response to the “Where to” APP account write-off difficulties noted in the circular, the New Kyoto newspaper reported where the network responded that to prevent black production from using frequent registrations, write-offs for profit, where registrations were made on an autonomous write-off basis, and where write-offs required a one-month interval.
The combined consideration of write-off convenience and account security has been changed to immediate effect and is pending review.
An unnamed cyber-security expert has indicated to new and medium-latitude clients that APP circulars like this, which violate user rights, have been issued three times this year by the Ministry of Information and Communications.
Three of these issues, the private collection of personal information, over-requirement of authority, and the difficulty of account write-offs, have been “managing”.
It can also be observed from the circulars that there is an increasing focus on violations of privacy by APPs.
On 24 July, on the day of notification of 58 violations of user rights, the Ministry of Labour and Communications indicated that a circular had been issued and that it had been deployed to carry out an advanced anti-user rights campaign.
Specialized corrections will strengthen monitoring and inspection in accordance with the rules, urge relevant enterprises to enhance the protection of APP personal information, correct in a timely manner outstanding issues such as the collection of irregularities, the use of user personal information and the harassment of users, the deception of users and the lack of implementation of managerial responsibilities for the application distribution platform, as well as the clean-up of AP applications.
The Lewis family: John Lewis is a warrior who fights for the weakest.
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter at a memorial service for him on Saturday, July 25.
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at an open memorial service at the University of Troy, Alabama, five brothers and sisters and a grandson of Lewis spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry “Grand” Lewis, the youngest brother of Lewis, said at the meeting, “He's dedicated his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John “Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble”.
He added that John had not listened to the mother's warning, and he said, “We all know that John always gets in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's a good trouble.”
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create “good trouble”, that is, not to shy away from provoking things for the sake of justice.
John applied for the University of Troy University, the city of Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the University of Troy, which was a white school, refused his application for admission.
As a child, John Lewis, a evangelical man on his farm, was awarded a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis an honorary degree.
Congressional Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters were “peaceful and non-violently protesting”, as Lewis had done in the civil rights movement.
According to Jones, “President Trump was wrong even when he knocked over a ship and described all the protesters as thugs.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation.”
A six-day series of events in honour of Lewis will culminate this week at the funeral in Georgia.
The casket of Lewis was parked on Saturday at a public memorial at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the leader of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, the remains of Lewis will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge of Selma.
In 1965, he and the black protesters who demanded the right to vote were beaten in front of the bridge by the Alabama police, who also fired tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
The day after that was called a bloody Sunday.
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require public participation in the event to wear masks and to maintain social distance.
The Governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered a half-flag to be lowered on Saturdays and Sundays in honour of Lewis.
During the almost week of commemoration, Lewis' remains will be divided into the Alabama State Council Building in Montgomery, the Georgia State Congress Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington, D.C., for public tributes.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Majority Party, announced last week that people could come to the House of the United States Congress on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, the public event to pay tribute to Lewis will take place outdoors.
Shenzhen's public consultation on the introduction of health regulations - Xinhuanet
On 26 July, Shenzhen Xinhua (a journalist, Maussing, White Yo) encouraged residents to perform medical examinations on a regular basis and to detect problems at an early stage; prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; set up a health screening system for online games; and had to be staffed with part-time health managers ... The Health Regulations of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (Consultation Draft) had been officially published, and the Shenzhen residents would have their own “health laws”.
In order to encourage residents to undergo medical check-ups and to identify problems at an early stage, it was suggested that the health services should develop a basic catalogue of health check-ups based on age, occupation, etc.
The cost of the health check-up, which falls within the basic catalogue of the health check-up project, is covered by the Consolidated Fund for Social Health Insurance at the rate of one per person per year.
The consultation draft made it clear that employers should allocate human resources, arrange staff time, introduce a rotation system for workers with higher mental and physical workloads, avoid excessive loss of human capacity or physical and mental health damage to their health, and enforce the system of paid employee leave.
In addition, employers are required to have dedicated part-time health managers and to organize regular staff health check-ups.
With regard to the physical and mental health of minors, the consultation draft proposed that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors should be prohibited, and that the location of the sale of alcoholic beverages should be restricted. In the event of a violation of the regulations, a fine of 30,000 yuan would be imposed on the management of the market.
In addition to the Prohibition of Liquor, minors also have to be “multi-opportunity”.
According to the consultation draft, schools are required to arrange for physical activity for more than one hour per day.
In the case of cyber games, the public security, cultural wide-tour sports, cyber-control, health and other sectors should improve the system of health supervision of Internet Internet service establishments, establish a system of health censorship of cyber games, and create a good space for interaction and a culture of interaction for the healthy development of young people.
In addition, the consultation notes that flu patients must wear masks when entering or leaving public places, and that health institutions are fined $20,000, etc. for leaking patients ' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of the population, the consultation draft also requires the Shenzhen sector to assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before planning and building urban spatial planning, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and ecological conservation, regulatory documents and approval of major construction projects and implementation of major public service projects.
No adoption or approval may be made for implementation without an assessment or assessment that would have a more severe adverse effect on urban public health or the health of the population.

In recent days, the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping, during his visit to Jilin province, stressed the need to strengthen party leadership, promote the extension of party organization to the lowest levels, improve the system of grass-roots party organization and provide strong guarantees of governance in urban and rural communities.
The insistence on party-led leadership and the integration of party leadership into all spheres of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for good governance at the grass-roots level.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level and to insist on party leadership, to promote the party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance by strengthening political leadership, building the bastions of battle, rallying red forces, and transferring the party's strength and ideas to the “last kilometre of the nerve”.
Focus on the calcium cast, and strengthen political leadership.
Political leadership for the strengthening of grass-roots governance requires the implementation of the calcium-repair project.
It is important to learn from the socialist ideas of the Chinese character of the Xi Jinping new era as a priority, to adopt the theme of “Don't forget the original, remember the mission” as the party's permanent theme and as the life-long subject of the party's members and cadres, to strengthen the philosophy of the original book, and to promote the party's innovative theory through thematic training, block training, discussion and exchange, the organization of lecture halls, etc., and to further strengthen the “four consciousnesss”, the “four self-confidences” and the “two preservations” of the party's cadres and better discharge of their responsibilities.
Through a combination of online and under-line learning, access to learning education is expanded, and grass-roots party organizations and party cadres are guided to incorporate learning education into the day-to-day and regular processes.
Focusing on practical exercise, in addressing the difficult issues of focus in the field of grass-roots governance, the concerns of the population, the issues of concern, the resolution of the problems, and the determination of party nature and capacity.
Get the rules up, build the fort of battle.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the system of governance at the grass-roots level and an important vehicle of governance capacity.
To promote the normative development of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the regulation of the operation of the Party's branches, the weakening of party leadership, the collapse of the party's leadership and the promotion of development through the establishment of mechanisms for networking, the creation of branches of innovation, the normal consolidation of weakness, the establishment of sound decision-making mechanisms, and the provision of services to the population.
In the countryside, the standardization of the organization of the village party is being strengthened, the construction standards of the party's branches are being standardized, the forms of organization, learning activities and management mechanisms are being regulated, and the system of “three sessions” and thematic party days are being promoted.
In cities, focusing on street communities, exploring the form of innovative branches, focusing on weak areas, “crowds” and “pain spots”, actively building a coalition of city parties to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, the institutional mechanisms for governance at the grass-roots level have been put in place, as well as the mechanisms for consultation, practical work, decision-making, urgent business, trouble-solving, decision-making under the leadership of grass-roots party organizations, and the mechanisms for connecting party cadres to serve the people, bringing together the people in the service of the people, enhancing the sense of access, happiness, honour and pride of the party population and making governance at the grass-roots level more warmer.
Play the vanguard, rally the red force.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Strengthening grass-roots governance, focusing on the governance of grass-roots party cadres, and on the role of the “red cell” as a model leader in grass-roots governance, bringing red forces together at the forefront of reaching out to the public.
The promotion of governance as a compulsory subject for members of the party at the grass-roots level, and the continuous strengthening of intellectual and professional training and practical exercise, as well as the promotion of a spirit of responsibility in their posts and in their urgent and demanding tasks, contribute to the development of the foundations for the modernization of the State's system of governance and its capacity to govern.
The campaign “Community whistle-blowing, Party membership reporting” involves participation in community building, management and services by participating in thematic party days, reaching out to people in need, defining service lines, accepting modest wishes, making sound recommendations, etc., and allowing members to play a role in community governance.
The full exercise of the role of non-members of the rural party, including through the creation of a pioneer post for non-members and the formation of a task force for non-members, should lead to the active participation of members of the grass-roots community in the fight against poverty, the construction of ecology, the maintenance of letters and visits, and the suppression of burns, in order to better integrate the red force in the service of the people.
Ground-based solidity building.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling edifice.
It is only by maintaining a strong focus on party cohesion and enhancing the well-being of the people, and by using party leadership as a fundamental means of promoting innovative development in governance at the grass-roots level, that the foundations of grass-roots party organizations can be established, and the cadres of the grass-roots parties can get up and run, and the grass-roots governance can be `hero', orderly, robust and effective.

Coco Sicily's antelope is back in the season-Xinhua net.
Xinning, Xining, Xining, Xinhua, on 25 July, a journalist (journalist Wang Kim) was informed by the Sanjiang National Parks Administration's five-way beam protection station at the Coco Sili Administration, Yangjiang Park District, that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope who had previously travelled to the suburb of Coco Sicily was ending their labour and began to return to their homes with their cubs.
Surveillance of the five beams near the protection station showed that on 25 July, about 40 female herds, led by three herds, continued to move back through the 3002 km of the Qingdang road, the five Qingdun railways, the Liangbei bridge, and the Tibetan herds began to move back.
Experts analysed that, in recent years, the number of puppies in removements has accounted for between one quarter and one fifth of the total.
The Deputy Researcher of the North-West Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences added: “In the early stages of the relocation, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being arrested for food, so that the number of puppies in the flock is relatively small and may even be without puppies.”
According to the Coco Siri Administration of the Yangtze National Parks Administration, the overall number of re-locations of Tibetan antelopes has increased year by year, from 4860 in 2019 to 338 in 2018.
Even the new statement: “It is expected that this year's reoccupation of Tibetan antelopes will be completed by the beginning of September, and the number of reoccupying antelopes is expected to continue to increase”.
Tibetan antelopes are protected at the national level.
At the end of May of each year, Tibetan antelopes from the Qinghai trijiang, Tibet Pond, Xinjiang Algin Hills, among others, go to the heart of Coco Sicily to produce lambs.
Our Tibetan antelope protection expert, Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Institute of Animals of the Province of Shaanxi (Northwestern Institute of Endangered Animals), said, “The return of Tibetan antelopes is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the female herds have finished giving birth. The first group of returns from the land of origin is larger, but then the herds will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different routes.”
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herds, the journalists were informed that the former Ministry of the Yangtze National Parks Administration has arranged for staff to conduct continuous video monitoring and district patrols in the main area of the relocation.
In the event that a hidden herd is found attempting to cross the road, the rangers will exercise temporary traffic control for the first time, allowing the herd to pass safely through the wildlife passage and ensuring that it will be subjected to as little human interference as possible on the return journey.
So, what do we do in everyday life?
The experts recommended that summer days should be taken as far as possible to avoid high-temperature periods and that it would be better not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, as the sun is the strongest and the heat is more likely to occur.
If it is necessary to go out during this period, protection must be done, such as setting an umbrella, wearing a suncap, wearing sunglasses, with conditions that are best used to wear sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
To the extent possible, clothing is selected in light, gas-friendly cotton, pine, silk, and less penetrating fibre-based clothing, in order to avoid a high rate of sweating that does not release the heat in a timely manner, which causes heat to catch heat.
When the heat and the heat of the weather are hot, sufficient water must be prepared, used in a timely manner, and water must not wait until it is thirsty, because once the thirst indicates that the body is already water-scarce, the drinking of water is controlled at 150 to 200 milliliters, the drinking of warm and open water, and the drinking of ice water.
Based on the high and low temperatures, the general population drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, while the high-temperature operators drink 3 to 5 litres per day.
When sweating is greater, some salt water can be properly replenished to compensate for the loss of salt from sweating.
In addition, the vulnerability of the human body to potassium shortages during the summer causes fatigue and fatigue, with potassium tea as an excellent summer drink.
During the summer, more vegetables and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc., can be used to supplement water with fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80 to 90 per cent; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be appropriately supplemented with drinking products containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
In summer, short nights, high temperatures, high levels of metabolism and high consumption, wearyness are easy.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and the entire body system, both for the benefit of work and learning, as well as for the prevention of heat and heat.
According to the experts, the best bedtime was between 2200 and 2300 hours, and the best time to get up was between 5.30 and 6.30 p.m.
Sleep with care not to lie under air conditioners, wind vents and electric fans, in order to avoid air conditioners and hot wind.
The experts recommend that people who operate outdoors or perform high-temperature operations may carry with them 10 drops of water, humans, hysteric or hysteric drugs, such as hysteria or hyphenols, or be placed in a nearby workplace and used at any time in order to prevent the outbreak of heat and heat.
And I want you to take some time to think about the very simple fact that, so far, much of what we know about the universe comes from the light.
We stand on Earth and look up at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The strong sunlight so piercing the eyes,
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
Ever since Galileo aimed his poor astronomical telescope at the celestial bodies of the universe, to this day, the universe that we know, through light, is before our eyes.
And with the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we've been able to gather a dazzling, silent image of the universe -- a series of images that can go back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent play, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own choreography, and the universe itself is playing, because space can be as vibrating as a drum.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of noises to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this great visual work about the universe a voice.
Although we've never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume over the next few years and hear what's going on there.
And for the big goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we're focusing on the black hole and the prospects it shows, because the black hole is capable of impacting time and space, making a very special sound like the drumming drum, and I'm very happy to play you some of the sound that we predicted.
One day in the future, we might see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but not yet seen.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they hit time and space like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like drums comes from Albert Einstein, and in fact many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the help lines that were painted on it.
But if we're free to fall in the universe, and if we don't, we're going to draw these lines, because we're going to find us moving along a straight line, along a straight line that doesn't bend, through the universe.
Einstein also realized that -- this is really the most critical part -- that if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will bend, and objects of the free fall will be turned around as they pass through objects like the Sun, along the path that is bent in space.
That's Einstein's great general relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When the bend reaches a certain level, it turns around the orbit of the solar motion, like the Earth around the sun, the moon around the Earth.
This is the natural curve of the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compress the sun into a six-km diameter ball -- that is, you compress a million times the mass of the Earth into a six-km diameter ball -- you're going to create a black hole in which the density of the object is so great that if the light is too close to it, it will not be able to escape -- leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were just a mathematical singularity.
He didn't believe in the existence of a black hole.
He believed that nature would stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades to begin to use the term "black holes" and to realize that black holes are real objects -- in fact, they are very high-mass stars that die after catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun does not collapse into a black hole.
Its quality is not really large enough.
But if we do some thought experiments -- Einstein very much likes to do this -- we can imagine crushing the sun into a six-km radius, and then putting a little Earth around it, like a 30-km orbit from the black hole sun.
The Earth will glow itself, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other sources of light -- so our little planet has to glow itself.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 km from the black hole and make it go around the orbit happy.
This black hole is actually about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could swell into Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object half as big as Manhattan.
So we move this planet to a place close to the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we see it orbiting the black hole along the perfect orbit.
There are rumours that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to actually fall into it.
But impressively, from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Light from the Earth, part of it falls into a black hole, but there's still part of it that we see when it bends.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
And if this is the story of Galactica at the Fortress, and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun does not collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them devours the galaxy, it'll look like this.
We'll see the shadow of a black hole cast into the galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars and the dust belts of stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we see the light being refractured around the black hole, and we don't even feel that some huge changes are happening at all, even as we begin to enter this shadow.
If we tried to start the rocket and get out of there, it wouldn't be good, because we couldn't escape, not even the light could.
The black hole looks dark from the outside, but it doesn't, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, because of the time-inflated effect of relativity, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the galaxy, and it looks like the galaxy outside is accelerating, just before we ourselves were destroyed by a black hole.
It's like experiencing near death, and you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone that you saw light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen the shadow of such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomeric landscape -- imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they used to be stars, and then they collapsed into two black holes -- 10 times the mass of the sun for each.
Now we're compressing them down to 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In a matter of seconds, they can travel thousands of kilometres, and in the process, they not only bend space, but also create a vibration of space in the tail flow behind it, a real wave of time and space.
The black hole, when it hits the universe, forces space to squeeze and stretch.
These vibrations spread at the speed of light in space.
This computer simulation was done by a relativist group from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to resolve the problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see -- it may be a little blurry -- you can see the red waves being fired out, and these are the gravitational waves.
They're the sound of the real universe, and these sound will spread out of these black holes at the speed of light, as the black holes merge into a quiet, spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will interact with the squeeze and stretch of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices.
Of course, you'll find, helplessly, that your head is squeezed and stretched, so you may not understand what's going on.
But I'd like to play the sound of our predictions for you.
This is the research of my team -- a relatively brief calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you hear comes from a small mass black hole colliding with space as it approaches a large mass black hole.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumming hammer knocking on space, making space vibrating like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the fall, small-mass black holes get faster and louder.
In the end, we'll hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I've never felt the sound so loud-- here it's actually magnified.
When I'm at home, I feel a little weak.
Sounds like, ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound that our team simulated.
I'm not here to show you images, because black holes don't leave any useful trails, real spaces don't show you the virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from this sound.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all shaking violently.
Then they will be integrated.
That sharp sound is a sign of the black hole's integration -- it's a sharp sound when it's over.
That's what we predict about what we're going to see.
Fortunately, we're very safe on Governor's Beach.
There is no doubt that, somewhere in the universe, two black holes have merged.
And it's also unquestionable that the space around us can feel these vibrations that pass over a million light years, or a million years ago, and they spread at the speed of light and finally meet with us.
But these voices are so small that we can't hear them at all.
There are experiments in the world that take a lot of effort to build -- one of which is called LIGO -- and it detects space vibrations that are smaller than one atomic nuclear range at every four kilometers.
It's a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be overtaken in the next few years -- it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start in the next 10 years, called LISA.
LISA will see super-mass black holes -- those millions, even billions, of black holes of the sun.
From the images from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
It looks like they're still hugging together.
Each of them may have a huge black hole of mass.
But they're not static, they're actually merging.
These two black holes will collide, and their integration will go through billions of years.
So collecting their voices has gone beyond the limits of our human perception.
But the LISA can see that two of the super-mass black holes that began to merge a long time ago, that's 15 minutes before they merged.
This detection is not limited to black holes, but it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe, the biggest of which is the Big Bang of the Universe.
When the word was created, some people mocked -- "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
And this is an animated short film made by my friend Proton Studios, which shows an external view of the Big Bang.
We would never really like to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is ubiquitous, and everything is surrounded by you, and space is swaying in a disorderly manner.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still haunts us.
Galaxies have evolved, and a group of stars have formed in galaxies, and on one planet, at least one of these planets is suitable for living.
Here, we're crazy about building experiments, doing calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
It's been sounding all the time in the air.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer -- 40,000 years ago, we were painting on the stone wall of the cave.
If we're going to get a sound from the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's a noise.
It's a white noise, a confused bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it's like music in our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe that we look up.
So in the years to come, we're going to be able to turn the music up a little bit, so that the universe can present itself to us in the form of audio.
But if we can detect the earliest moments, it will take us even further from understanding the Big Bang, and allow us to ask some of the most difficult, but also the most remote, questions.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear that loud noise, but is our big explosion the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we can't help but ask, has there been a similar big explosion before then?
Will it ever happen again?
I'd like to say that if the significance of this issue rises to the level that TED advocated as a trigger for people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never answer.
But we can't help but ask: will our universe just be an episode in a bigger history?
Or are we just one of the branches of the diverse universe -- each of which has experienced its own big explosion -- and maybe some of the black holes that buzz, maybe some of them, some of them, maybe some of the conscious lives, some of the non-existent -- that are not part of our past, or our future, but rather linked to us in some way?
So, we can't help but guess, if there's a multi-polar universe, in the other branches of this multipolar universe, is there life?
This is the life of our diverse universe.
Is there any other life in the multiplicity of universes, and will they not also be guessing about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
And if that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, developing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds that came from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Graduate art exhibition to market public goods exhibition - Xinhuanet
During the “Yun graduation” season in various universities, a rare underline graduate art exhibition began with the warmth of the weekend.
However, it was not in the galleries, nor in the campus, but in the public space of the City of Yoo-yang, and was open to the public free of charge until 23 August.
The journalist learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Fair gathered 50 pieces/groups of work from 57 young artists from the Central School of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin School of Fine Arts, and that the exhibition space was extended from 2nd to 6th floor, making full use of the building ' s light box for the presentation of the flat works, with the greatest possible degree of artistic atmosphere during the graduation season.
This exhibition is particularly relevant in the context of the epidemic.
“We have chosen to bring back below-line space to the graduation show, which will lead to the `cloud end', and we want more people to see young people understand their own exploration and the world, and to magnify the healing power of art for society and the mind.”
She revealed that the exhibit, which was collected from graduates of several art institutions and selected from among others suitable for commercial space displays, ranged from drawings on traditional racks, sculptures, to new media devices, interactive drawings, VR panoramas, and was the largest in size and abundance in the years.
Among them, Li Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual creative language in the first battle of 2020; Liu Ka-young explored the themes of “encrypted currency”, “credit creation”, “trade”, and so forth, through the work created by the Tai's block chain; Zhang's Catwood and Qui-dao's Platoon are animals often associated with human beings, from which the young artists' understanding of human-animal relations can be seen; and the Quetta's work, Winter of Faith — A Gift, is a reminder to growing young people that “when one day's career comes to fruition, remember the pure and sincere”.
Of the small number of graduates who personally present the exhibition, there are Lee Ying-chung from the sculpture department of the Tianjin School of Fine Arts.
“I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, with alcohol cotton and test reports.”
His work, Yesterday's The Enigma, was more complex in structure and had to be personal.
At the same time, he has the task of helping his fellow students to repair damaged works.
"The show goes to 4:30 a.m., then it's patched up, it's tight, forgets to take a picture of the work, and it's a bit of a shame."
He hoped that when the epidemic stabilized, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work show.

That morning, 65-year-old Bossonaro sent a photo on Twitter, in which he was wearing sneakers, no masks, sitting in front of a table with breakfast with a smile on his face, one hand with a thumb, and the other hand with a box of hydrazine medicine.
He wrote on the tweet: "Good morning, everyone. New coronary virus results: negative."
However, Bossonaro did not indicate when the new coronary virus was tested.
On 5 July, there was a new coronary pneumonia in Bossonaro, who was tested positive for the virus on 6 July, and on 7 July he declared on television that he had diagnosed a new coronary pneumonia.
On 14 and 21 October, Bosonaro conducted two additional tests for the new coronary virus, the results of which remain positive.

The open-end fans buy tickets in the diamond stadium of the Qingdao National Sports Centre (the Qingshan stadium), and the sale of tickets is based on a system of on-line and off-line ticketing, with all fans having a 12-year-old nucleic acid test within 48 hours.
Incented by $50,000, Hubei Eun-hyun for the landslide of the sand dam, the "Alarm First" - the new Chinese net.
On 26 July, the Hubei daily newspaper (journalist Lin Jing), Eunshi City reported that Chen Xiang, a geohazard site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of the sand dam landslide, had sent him $50,000 in prizes.
At the same time, the entire cadre of the municipal party was called upon to learn from his dedication, commitment, initiative and dedication.
On 21 July, a landslide in the sand dam in the village of Tumburg, Nsh city, led to the formation of a Qingjiang Riverway, where Chen Xian, age 58, was the first to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Xiang was informed of the breaking of the walls of the villagers ' homes and immediately visited the site.
Just five or six hundred metres out of his home, he saw a group of village roads split by four or five centimetres, stretching along the road to the cornfield, about 50 metres in length.
Chen Qun was alert to sending photographs of the first break-up of the road to the “Geological Disaster Monitor Contact Group” in the countryside.
Following on-site inspection and judgement by the relevant officials of the Tumburg Regional Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of a landslide was high and a decision was taken to evacuate the crowd.

Australasia developed a new drug that is expected to be used to treat the new crown-induced vascular congestion - the Xinhua Net.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, Xinhua Society, Sydney, on 26 July (journalist Chen Woo), are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and it is hoped that it will be used for the treatment of vascular congestion caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in a blood plate accelerates blood plate condensation before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they develop a drug that temporarily inhibits plaque condensation, thus avoiding vascular congestion and preventing heart disease and stroke.
According to researchers, the drug only inhibits the condensation effect of blood platelets in the event of a heart attack or a stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular congestion is one of the leading causes of death among new coronary patients, researchers hope that the drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had good results in animal modelling experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research have been published in the United States magazine Science Conversion Medicine.
He became the first audience to come after the CBA rematch allowed the audience to watch the game live.
On that day, during the second round of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) resumed in Qingdong Island, Shandong, from 2019 to 2020, medical personnel, teachers, public security fighters, through the official ticket-buying platform, completed the related process, including nucleotide testing, and went to the scene to watch the Shanghai Jianjin team's battle against the Mount East and West Kings.
During the competition, the participants were required to wear masks throughout the journey, to take seats at a strict distance of one metre.
When leaving, the audience is required to maintain an orderly exit from the social distance of the “one metre” in the order of the rear, front and back.
Xinjiang Deep Farming to Sunflower with Clean Energy - Middle New Network
2020-07-26 15:43:42 Source: China News Network.
Xinjiang Hami 26 July, Chinese News Agency, called Xinjiang's Deep Farming to Sunflower with Clean Energy.
More than 6000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 m2 of each piece, rounded and neat, like a silver “Sunflower” to the sun, reflect the sun and generate electricity at a thermal tower more than 200 metres high in the centre.
This scene was seen by journalists at the Harmi Molotov cocktail-type light-thropic power plant at the Central Electric Project in the town of Lake Frou, Igu, Xinjiang Hami.
“The so-called molten salt tower luminescent power generation is the reflection of the sun's light through mirrors into the soaking towers to generate heat, and the conversion of thermal energy into electricity through traditional power generation techniques.”
Zhang Yong, Deputy General Manager of China-Home Solar Thermal Power Co. Ltd., described its design principles as similar to those of the solar stoves used in rural areas of the north-west of China, and the need to gather solar light.
Construction of the plant began in October 2017 and was completed at the end of last year with a net-connected area of 6,600 acres, with a total planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
“The greatest advantage of the traditional solar power generation technology is that the concentrated thermal energy can be stored and generated at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour storage system deployed by the project would allow the generator team to operate in a continuous and stable manner, free from light changes; it could also participate rapidly in the power grid tweaks, in accordance with the needs of the grid load valley.
When fully completed, the project will achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of coal per year, reduce the emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous source of clean energy locally.
In addition to this, there is another silver “Sunshine Sunflower” in the Shizuku industrial park in the city of Hammi.
The Hamifor Photovoltaic Photovoltaic Station occupies over 2,300 acres of land, and the 714 installed power generation units also follow the sun and maintain a 90-degree straight angle between the solar light and the photoplate.
“We use two-axis tracking concentrated light power generation technology, which, through integrated integrated control, will maintain the efficiency of all power generation equipment in accordance with the adjusted angle of the Sun's altitude.”
Mnuki, the station's head, said that, in light weather conditions, the power generation technology could increase by about 20 per cent in comparison with the conventional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of the year, the station has already generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Ishigami Photovoltaic Industrial Park is the largest single site in Xinjiang today and the most complete type of photovoltaic component is a demonstration park in the photovoltaic industry, with a total of 38 photovoltaic projects with a total of 820,000 kW installed.
In the first half of the year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity generation were completed, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best-served regions of China with solar energy resources.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megacalories per square metre, which is around 3,200 hours per day throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has been vigorously developing the photovoltaic industry, which has grown “Sun-Aunata”.
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation have been built and the city ' s photovoltaic capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14 per cent in the same year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic power stations with a installed capacity of over 10 million kW.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees throughout the year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of the “disconnection of female college students to the Qinghai Sea” search and rescue continues - Xinhuanet.
Xinning Xining, Xining, Xinhua, on July 26, recently, “a female university student lost contact after travelling to Qinghai Gaewood” was a matter of concern to the Internet.
On 26 June, the Public Security Bureau of the Tibetan Tibetan Autonomous Oblast, Haixi, Qinghai Province, informed that a student from a university in Nanjing, Huang Xiao, is still in disarray and that the police are actively engaged in search work along a lost land in Qinghai Province.
On 10 July 2020, the security unit of the Ghorgi City Public Security Department in Heisy County was informed by its superiors that a student from a university in Nanjing, who was travelling from Nanjing to Ghorgi in a Z164 train on 5 July, and that on 9 July, in the south-west part of the river, at the Sonam Daj Protection Station in the Tamaleh Autonomous State of Tamale, Qinghai Province, had lost hand-held capability and requested assistance in the search.
According to the investigation conducted by the Ghorgi City Public Security Bureau, Huang Xiao entered the territory of Qinghai province at 1954 hours on 6 July and arrived in the city of Ghormu at 0400 hours on 7 July.
At 0800 hours on the same day, the missing person, a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in the city of Ghorgi, headed towards G109, arrived at 1200 hours at the Coco Sicily Sonam Daje protection station, and the taxi driver returned alone. At 1500 hours on one of the seven days, the taxi driver arrived at the riverine area near the Sonandaje protection station, which was closed until 1800 hours on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police discovered that Huang had passed through the Nagui Gou checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
In view of the lack of video surveillance and the inability to establish information on the person and the vehicle on which he was travelling, the Nagui Gou checkpoint, a checkpoint established by the city of Naque in the Tibet Autonomous Region at the south entrance of the city of Ghorm, was able to search the road by car, coordinating the discovery of the yellow at various checkpoints along the Tibetan route and immediately contacting the public security bureau of the city of Ghorm.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on 26 July, the Ghorgi City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces with rescue equipment to search for the Infested Spring Protection Station and Sonandaje Protection Station along the Qingzhou Road, and actively contacted the Sichuan Police, the Tibetan Police and the Nanjing Police to work together, and search and rescue efforts are continuing.
The local police would like to have relevant leads from a wide range of online and social sources made available to the Ghorgi police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, with a view to the early identification of the missing persons.
At the same time, experts advised tourists to regulate, rational, civilized their outdoor activities, keep an eye on roadside warning signs, not risk entering unmanned areas, in case of an emergency, and to report to the police in a timely manner.
The American media revealed the truth about the unprovoked American demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Imaging Network
The American media revealed the unprovoked demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 November, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the sudden request by the United States to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 December.
This act of the United States Government is a source of concern, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
According to many foreign agents, it is not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media has made a forthright statement: for the sake of the general election.
CNN 23 reported that the demand by the United States to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the catastrophic response of the United States Government to the new crown epidemic caused President Trump to have a lower rate of popular support in the run-up to the elections.
White House officials privately claimed that the hard-line strategy with China was to save Trump's support, but also to shift responsibility for the failure of the White House epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a “politically driven, very cautious” target chosen by the United States, which the United States Government chose “in order to create a strong attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict”.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that, at a time when the United States is on the threshold of the general election season and the United States economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that “the playing of the `China card' has a political advantage”.
The current situation is “a spiral-up, inverse struggle”, driven in part by domestic considerations by the United States Administration, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
The Colombian Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that Trump's prospects for re-election had been strained by the outbreak, and that he had repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
In the United States, there are almost daily new actions against the absurd rhetoric of the so-called “China exploits the United States” by Trump.
“The Houston Consulate General is of great importance in establishing the ties between the two countries.”
Associated Press commented that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
In the event of the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston deplored the request of the United States to China to close its Consulate General in Houston, stating that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The American Foreign Policy magazine website argues that this move by the United States “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that only worsen relations between the United States and China”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia from the Brookings Institution of the United States think tank, as saying that, since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he had no idea what could be compared with the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
According to analysts, such a move could result in persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which was established in 1979, was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China maintains an embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

In 1696, the tsar Peter the Great began to form a naval fleet, beginning with the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July of each year is the Russian Naval Festival.
In response to new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since 17 July Xinjiang trade unions at all levels have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, as called for by the General Union of Autonomous Communities.
The Tianshan-North trade union cadres, workers, labour models, etc., enter the street community, the general population, and carry out activities such as the delivery of food, the decontamination of bacteria and the dissemination of information on the prevention of the disease. They serve the workers and show the union's “hard nuclear forces” with practical actions.
In recent days, the Tianshan General Trade Union in Urumqi, a team of condolences, delivered a much-needed outbreak prevention and control package to staff in 12 isolation points.
In the wake of the epidemic, more than 1.05 million yuan was spent for the first time in the Tianshan region and, on an emergency basis, 23 direct trade unions were allocated.
Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang, Deputy Secretary of the Xinjiang I Party Committee, and President of the trade union, Zhao Sang-guk, after being notified of the company ' s prevention and control of the epidemic, offered to remain on duty in order to protect the workers.
He delivers cookers, food and day-care items for workers living in the unit dormitories and new entrants, and arranges for them to be provided with essential supplies every two days.
“As of 21 July, a survey was carried out of the cadres on the front line of the war `epidemic' and, by means of the down-to-the-road and commercial delivery, the 704 first-line workers in the Urumqi region were supplemented with anti-epidemic supplies and living materials.”
The Xinjiang trade union officials told journalists that, in the face of the outbreak, they were fully committed to ensuring the security of services for the prevention and control of the epidemic, steadily promoting the development of transport, and creating a strong climate for the fight against the pandemic.
At a time of high summer temperatures, trade unions at all levels are focusing on front-line workers in priority areas of epidemic prevention and control, giving practical attention to “cooling out” concerns.
On 19 July, the General Union of Urumqi Districts launched a condolence mission to “secute” frontline workers in order to combat the epidemic, and the entire county police station, card points and health system received condolence items such as beverages, fruit, etc.
“Commonwealth officials need to further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, care for the warmth of the people and inspire action.
The role of trade union organizations in uniting and uniting workers, ensuring the protection of the prevention and control of the epidemic, actively defending the health rights and interests of workers in general, and bringing care to front-line workers is to be fully realized.”
The head of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Communities stated that:
Immediate recruitment of cadets was fully launched in 2020 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society, Beijing, 26 July, the Ministry of Political Work of the Xinhua Military Committee (journalist Jaqonglong) and the Ministry of Defence Mobilization of the Xinhua Military Committee issued a joint circular in recent days on the deployment of a direct recruitment of cadets from general higher education graduates by 2020.

Speaker at the British Embassy: The Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on 25 July, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom asked journalists about false statements about the cyber attack.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cybersecurity, had always firmly opposed and combated all forms of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
Questions were asked by journalists: according to the media, hacker groups associated with China had interfered with a British network of companies, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded the European Union national government network.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cybersecurity, had always firmly opposed and combated all forms of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
The virtual nature of cyberspace, the difficulties of traceability, the diversity of actors and the need to produce sufficient evidence to justify speculation when investigating and characterizing cyber-events.
The past series of events, such as the prism door, had proved that the United States had been conducting the largest cyber-tapping operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
China ' s achievements in science, technology and innovation had not been stolen, but had been achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted some 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major country of innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans from Xinjiang-based farmers and micro-enterprises were increased by more than the full year of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank, using a variety of monetary policy tools, led the banking sector to step up its lending efforts, providing sufficient financial guarantees for the prevention of the epidemic and the resumption of work.
Most of Urumqi's free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
In a briefing on the latest outbreak and test of nucleic acid in the city of Urumqi, the Director of the Urumqi Health Commission, Zhang Wei, on 26 July, Urumqi, a journalist in Sun Tinwen Yamin, said that most of the free testing of nucleic acid in the city of Urumqi was now almost complete.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by a team of State Council experts and experts from the autonomous regions and the municipality of Urumqi on the basis of the results of the nucleic acid detection and epidemiology survey.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference to inform about the Xinjiang epidemic and its prevention and control.
According to him, between 000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the city of Urumqi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infections) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, there were 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqi and 147 cases of unsymptomatic infections.
The 25-day asymptomatic infections were also largely screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
On 26 June, Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in the city of Urumqi had been largely completed.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there were a number of factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and discharge of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time the sample was taken, which could lead to the absence of the specimen, and the environment of testing, the operational proficiency of the tester.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid testing also produces pseudo-negative results.
Pseudo-negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, two tests of nucleic acid are usually required to exclude persons who have been in close contact with diagnosed and suspected cases.
For those who have travelled to high-risk areas of the epidemic, two nucleic acid tests are required to exclude the possibility of a pseudo-negative presence of a nucleic acid test in the event of fever and respiratory symptoms.
In the light of the above, he states that, for the sake of the physical health of the entire city's population, the city of Urumqi will, from today's date, conduct a second free test of nucleic acid in priority areas such as Tianshan, Shaibak district, and conduct a “recovery” exercise.
The Tianshan and Shaibak districts are known to be high-risk areas.
On the other hand, the U.S. World Film Festival brought out an extraordinary sense of industrial confidence - a new net.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Reporter, Wang Si-seok
The “on-the-clouds” was intensely streamlined under the line, and the Shanghai International Film Festival brought out a great deal of industrial confidence.
Yesterday, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival of 2020, organized in the context of strict quarantine measures, was inaugurated by this newspaper, the Chief Reporter Wang Ying, as an industrial summit forum on “A comprehensive journey towards a new era of dreams” and the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival.
This year ' s Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance as the first international film festival since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of our epidemic prevention and control.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, based on the normalization of the epidemic, is both a sign of confidence and a sign of determination – the determination to fight the epidemic, the determination to hold people’s festivals, the determination to build a global centre for film creation, and the calling of the “Shanghai culture” brand.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its innovative and progressive posture, is a fresh start and a fresh start.
Therefore, every step needs to be taken to serve the spiritual life of the population and the high-quality development of the visual industry.
This year more than ever.
In an effort to value the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, has scrupulously adhered to the requirements of the epidemic and implemented measures to prevent and control the epidemic, and, on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for the creation of Chinese films and meeting the needs of the fans, has opened a multi-section of activities on the line and under the line.
On the first day of the opening, from underline viewing to industry forums, film festival-related activities strictly implemented the relevant vaccination policy.
The activities of the Forum are controlled by up to 50 persons, with each sighting being isolated and with a tight seating rate of up to 30 per cent.
As the Film Festival Committee holds, in any event, it is a major premise that “the safety and physical well-being of the population should be placed first”.

White House epidemiologist Foggy: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021.
Fuch 25 made the above statement at a web-based videoconference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He cautioned that it was not yet clear how the new coronary epidemic would develop in autumn and winter, or what its ultimate impact would be, “and that the only way to put an end to it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution”.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States reached 4,176,000 and 146,000 deaths as at 2100 hours on 25 February.
Foggy said that some parts of the United States were currently struggling to combat the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic varies from one region to another and requires tailored responses, a diversified response does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect other regions.
“This is no time for complacency”, Foggy said, “Our work has not been completed, we must intensify our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future”.
The United States Chinese medical expert and founder of the “Littletail Therapy” for AIDS pointed out at the conference that the new United States crown epidemic has not yet reached its peak.
“Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus.”
What is the big call for the public to use its own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new coronary treatment drugs and vaccines?
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, working to raise the profile of Asia-Pacific Americans and to nurture international youth leaders.

In particular, they paid tribute to the first-line anti-epidemic Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to preventive norms such as “social distance” to curb the spread of the epidemic.

On 25th, the Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival 2020 and the first Red Cultural Industry Expo will be inaugurated in Tianshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the dilemma of a small number of young people, homogenization of tourist projects, and a single channel for commercialization.
In particular, this year's outbreak struck, the country's cultural and tourist industry suffered a severe setback and red tourist attractions faced serious challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experiences can satisfy tourist “unattended and unattended” tours; the introduction of live webcasts to promote red-viewed eugenics, which can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of cloud-based technologies to create thematic, focused, rich displays of red-viewed fines, and to give full expression to and enhance the pedagogic function of red-viewed areas; and the innovative dissemination of red culture to “live” revolutionary cultural objects, to popularize red-tour tourism, to allow red-genetic transmission and to increase the attractiveness of red-scene attractions.
The cultural festival, which used the popular “District (District) Chiefs + Vocational Masters” to promote red-language features, the 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstrations, and the promotion of red-language attractions, are all attempts to insert intelligent wings for red-tourism, with the expectation that Hunan-Red-Red tourism will become more and more popular.
A representative of the US-China Trade Conference. A meeting in August.
On 25 August, the Hong Kong South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous source who reported that the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Xuan, and the co-leader of the United States team, Trade Representative Lai Hae-chul, were expected to hold a formal meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States.
It has been reported that, while China has significantly increased its procurement of United States agricultural products over the past few months, there is still some distance from the volume promised in the trade agreements due to, among other things, the new coronary virus epidemic.
According to analysts, the recent closure of each other ' s consulates in the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Central American trade agreement, which entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, provided for a high-level trade framework team from both sides to meet biannually.
Informed sources revealed that the meeting would be an “important turning point” to allow the parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, the same source also said that if the tension between the United States and China led to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, both sides might agree that the telephone conference of 8 May between Rae Hae-chul and Crane had met the provisions of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origins of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology as a whole.
President Trump, while boasting at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
At a White House press conference, he said that, although China had recently purchased a record number of United States corn on a single day, and had bought a lot of soybeans, “this trade deal is now more relevant to me than it was at the time of its conclusion”.
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also argued that a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely to take place because of poor US-China relations, and that “trade issues have lost weight in US-China relations.”
But he revealed that China’s trade-related unit still met on 23th to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States, “we have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
The Vice-President of the US-China Trade Commission, Peng Jianning, said that it was “more important than ever” to maintain the initial phase of the agreement, and that China had made progress this year in further opening financial markets to US companies.
An independent research firm, Plenum's analyst, said, “It's better to talk than not, though it may be treated as a routine.”
On 26 July, Xinhua, Xinhua, a journalist in Beijing (journalist Wei Yu Gon), was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the National Preventive and Emergency Management Departments, in conjunction with the National Food and Material Reserve, were once again urgently transferring 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square metres of woven cloth, 130,000 square metres of earthwork cloth, six categories of central stocks of anti-pill materials to Anguan, in support of flood preparedness and rescue efforts.
According to the Officer-in-Charge of the Department of Emergency Management, at present, high water levels are maintained in the middle and lower of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin, where the “Gang River flood No. 3 of 2020” was formed in the upper part of the Yangtze and local risks increased.
The meteorological sector anticipates heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the lower and middle areas of the Yangtze River over the next three days, and the situation with regard to anti-horse protection remains serious and complex.
It has been reported that, since its entry, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national integrated fire rescue team to pre-position specialized rescue units in priority areas, participating in a total of 10364 flood rescue operations involving more than 130,000 fighters, 17778 fire trucks, 11887 boats, 37,777 people in distress and the evacuation and transfer of more than 107,000 people in distress.
Nazdak's Chief Representative for China: The best time node for Chinese companies to go to the US IPO — Economic Watch — professional financial news site
The economic watch network, journalist Zhang Bin, imposed stricter regulation on the Chinese capital in the United States market due to the counterfeiting of Ruyin's coffee, coupled with a long period of valuation pressure, pressure on the Chinese stock market in the United States, and the recent return journeys to Hong Kong of the Chinese and Chinese capital stock, among others, to Hong Kong.
And in the recent past, shell, ideal automobiles, etc., have become more popular in the United States.
In the midst of the epidemic and the Chinese crisis, is it the best time for Chinese businesses to go to the United States?
“In the case of recent IPOs, and in the case of companies that are going to go to the United States, IPOs are inherently unaffected. Instead, the market is now very good, and even now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to IPOs in the last 10 years.”
The chief representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, China District, Xuan Sheng, stated at the “Sharing of shares at the 2020 summit of listed company leaders” hosted by snowball.
In April of this year, the US SEC and the US Public Corporation Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a Statement on the Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – Discussion of the Challenges of Access to Current Information for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement indicated that, while international cooperation and coordination had increased significantly in recent years, problems in access to information persisted in the United States regulatory sector, and that SEC and PCAOB continued to face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to that document, the PCAOB website provided a detailed list of listed companies facing audit barriers and their audit institutions, with a large number of central stock companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Bill, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
The crisis did not affect the appetite of investors, as seen in the glorification of China.
“When the news first came out, everyone was horrifying about whether the future could still be marketed in the United States, but then we found out that the issues were not on the investors' side, and that the investors might ask them, or even become, standardization when they were on their way to the United States IPO, but that was not treated by the investors as an important factor in the investment and the non-investment of a Chinese company.
It is recommended that the current situation be viewed with as little common sense as possible.
This, of course, may appear to be the worst situation in the past two years, but the appetite of investors has not been affected in any way.
So the tide of IPOs in the United States will continue from now until the end of this year or before the United States general elections.”
On 9 May this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in Nasdak, the United States, as the first Chinese company to go to IPO in the aftermath of the epidemic.
“The listing of Jin Shanyun gives a great deal of confidence to the Chinese company that prepared the IPO.”
The Xiang Seong sign.
In the first half of the year 2020, snowball released a report of mid-year stock estimates showing that in the first half of the year there were 20 IPO-China enterprises going to the United States, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; In terms of total initial funding, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, a recovery from the same period last year, an increase of over 52.4 per cent; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health-care sector was remarkable in the first half of the year, an increase of 100 per cent over the same period last year.
According to Chen Sheng, Chinese companies that went to the United States to IPO in the first half of the year were of high quality, with strong fundamentals and growth-oriented quality companies, and would be more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Chen Sheng continues to be optimistic about Ming Chinese companies going to the U.S. IPO.
“In the short term, the tide of IPOs to the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A, Port, and United States shares, with the US general elections and Sino-American relations as a factor in market choices and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normal, with market fluctuations occurring in cycles, both political and economic, and eventually return to the normal phase, with the stock market traditionally moving ahead.”
At the same time, he said, “There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are strong and grow as investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies.”
On the evening of July 25th, the “Dance of Life” of the series of National Theatre “Speaks like Summer Flowers” was staged in parallel on-line, on the night of July 25, China's new network Beijing (journalist Gaukay), with the co-director Yang Yang, the pianist Zhang Qing Qing, and the national great theatre orchestra, singing Rahmaninov's Second Piano Concert and the Symphony.

That evening, the music will be opened in the bells of the popularly expected "Ra II" piano, which was the first time that the concert of the National Theatre "Speaks like Summer Flowers" was dedicated to the audience.
With his deep and condensed understanding, Zhang Xing Xing made the first theme of his work, filled with sorrow and entanglement, and under Yang's command, the orchestra and the piano created constant hearing and enjoyment in the vagaries of competition and compromise.
In the wake of the second glimmer of “silence” and the third cynic of “massive festivities”, more than a hundred viewers gave a warm round of applause during the re-entry of the scene, as well as a heartfelt praising by the online audience in the form of a screen and commentary.
Then Zhang Xuan Qing played back to the scene with a replay of Chopin's "Live C Nights" to the audience.
After a brief reprogramming of the stage, the Yang Command of the National Theatre Orchestra played the last great Orchestra by Rahmaninov, the symphony of the orchestra, in which the composers displayed a more internal sentiment and incorporated his new inspiration and memory of his past creation and his homeland.
In the calm and silent handling of the Yang Yang, the melancholy and healing atmosphere of the work was revealed, and the band also watched Rahmaninov's “final spark” as well.
The concert's pre-enactment was once again a surprise to the audience.
In the backstage dressing room of the National Theatre, the main anchor of NewsFoundation just came to reveal the “constituency” of the musical masters Jedjeev, Langlang and others before the stage. He then went to the public space on the first floor of the National Theatre, where he had a quick dialogue with Yang, Zhang Jing and the National Theatre organist in front of three nine-foot pianos with a view of a senior piano fan and discussed with them the topics of the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, Rakhmaninov's music, the life of musicians and the preparation of the stage, and, at the end of the tour, the Shumann Dreams, in cooperation with Zhang Xuan Xing's “composure”, gave the view of an audience.

People's Daily Commentator: Focusing on what's best for you, building new advantages for future development — the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, July 25th, Beijing, July 26th, commenter, People's Daily: Focus on what's best for you, building new advantages for future development.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grave and complex, and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic stamina, increasing the confidence to win and concentrating our efforts on our own is key to addressing the various risks we face.
At the recent Entrepreneurs Symposium, Secretary-General Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of rising protectionism, a low world economy and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate on our own tasks, taking full advantage of the country ' s mega-market advantages, gradually developing new patterns of development that are dominated by a large domestic cycle and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles, raising the level of modernization of the supply chain of industrial chains, vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the entry of key core technologies and building new advantages for future development.
The man with the power, the man with the power, wins.
In an external environment of deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country, “two sides outside”.
Now, the world under the shock of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, with more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization with a backwind and a back wave.
Preparing our economy for a long period of time to cope with the changes in the external environment and to take advantage of the tide and the distance of our economy is of the utmost importance, namely, to use the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its strengths and to give impetus to the economic recovery of the world through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening of the domestic cycle.
We want to be deeply aware of the fact that the long-term development and long-term security of our country are linked to the construction of a complete system of domestic demand.
The Party's central review of the state of affairs clearly sets out a firm strategy for the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term healthy development of the country's economy and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
Our country, with its most complete and largest industrial system, strong productive capacity, well-developed accompanied capacity, with more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million people with higher education or specialized skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, is in the process of rapid development of new forms of industrialization, information, urbanization and modernization of agriculture, with enormous investment needs.
The socialist basic economic system, such as the system of the socialist market economy, which is the main subject, the co-development of a multi-owned economy, the distribution of labour as the main subject, the coexistence of multiple forms of distribution, and the system of socialist market economies, stimulates the dynamism of the various types of market subjects, liberates and develops social productivity, and promotes efficiency and equity, organic unity and common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand so that production, distribution and circulation links are more dependent on domestic markets for a virtuous circle, with clear strategic direction for structural supply-side reforms and a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
There is a need to accelerate the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, to vigorously promote science, technology and innovation and all other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the development of new and strategic industries, such as the digital economy, smart manufacturing, health of life and new materials, to create new and additional growth points and poles, and to evolve into new patterns of development that are dominated by a large domestic cycle and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles.
Openness brings progress and closure inevitably lags behind.
Secretary-General Xi has repeatedly stressed that the door open in China will not be closed, but will only be wider.
The domestic cycle is by no means a closed-door operation, but rather a stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to better connect domestic and international markets and to make better use of both international and domestic markets, as well as two resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between the expansion of domestic demand and openness, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to the construction of new patterns of openness and the more conducive it is to the emergence of new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While there is now a rise in international protectionist thinking, we must stand on the right side of history and insist on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and fostering the creation of a community of human destinies.
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more frustrated, growing and rising from it.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party ' s central centre, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system of China ' s character, the strong mobilization power and strong combined strength, and the unity of the nation ' s entire army, we will be able to overcome all the difficult and dangerous obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development in our country, complete the construction of a small and prosperous society, and successfully embark on a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
The rest of the proceeds are “after 90” instead of “retaliatory” savings.
As the balance money went down, not only did `after '90' not escape the balance, but instead began to save money in `retribution'?
In the first half of the year, the “after-90” savings report, published by the China Institute of New Economic Research in the run-up to the joint payment of the treasure, showed that the amount of money saved per capita increased by almost 40 per cent over 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more likely to start with a small amount of money, with an average of 60% of the savings below $20...
Saving money with the balance is also a “after-90” practice.
The data show that of the 700 million surplus treasure users, 134 million are “after 90”.
China has 174 million “after 90”, which means that about three out of every four “after 90” countries are saving their savings.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return for monetary funds, such as the balance, has fallen from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to around 1.5 per cent.
Even so, the pace of “after 90” savings has not been affected.
In the context of the “saving effect” of surplus treasures, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance treasures are also directly transformed into “fundamentals”.
Data on payment treasures show that, as of 13 July, the number of new “base people” on payment treasures had increased more than one-fold over the past month, and that an increasing number of young people were making progress on payment treasures.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from the balance sheet to the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that “after 90” girls are more likely to save more, on average 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of the users of funds on payment platforms are men, and women tend to choose a more prudent financial approach than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for “after 90”?
Payment Treasure data show that “after 90” is used to save money, with the largest number of users targeting travel.
As a result of the epidemic, many “after-90s” have saved money to prepare for post-epidemiological travel; the reopening of cinemas has also provided new avenues for moving from savings to consumption.

French Defence Minister Florence Palley said on 24th that France would add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defence budget to develop a military force in space in order to guard against “unfriendly acts” that other countries might undertake in outer space.
Pali told the newspaper Provence on the same day that, between 2019 and 2025, the budget for spending on French space military projects would increase from €3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) previously proposed to €4.3 billion (US$5 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
The President of France, Emmanuel Markron, announced last July that a military space command and an “aeronautical and space force” would be established within the French air force.
Pali said that she would officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence region, at a later date.
Pali said that the space force, which belonged to the air force, had reached 500 by 2025.
She said, "The idea that space used to be thought to serve the common good of science is gone. Space is now the arena for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated what Markron had said before, saying that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are not in any way engaged in an arms race, but it is my duty to fully identify the threats we may face.”
Pali retraced the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Sneeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this assertion.
Pali said that France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting “the dark hands behind those unfriendly moves”.
According to the French media, the reason for France ' s search for a space force was the request made last February by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to the United States Department of Defense to draft a bill for the establishment of the Tai Air Force.
Trump signed the Defence Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth largest United States military force, the Pacific Air Force.
Some experts were concerned that those United States initiatives had accelerated the militarization of United States space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

The shared accommodation market was reported to have been warming since March - the new Chinese network
The recently released China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as " the Report " ), published by the National Information Centre for Sharing Economic Research in this newspaper, journalist Yang Hak-kwe, shows that, in the first five months of 2020, the volume of trade in the shared accommodation market fell by 72.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
However, the shared accommodation market has been warming since March, and market turnover, orders and reception numbers have been gradually restored.
The Report shows that the volume of trade in the shared accommodation market has declined significantly, on the one hand, as a result of a sharp drop in demand for travelling accommodation under the control of the epidemic, a sharp decline in the number of orders, a 65 per cent decline in the total number of orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of recipients over the same period, and, on the other hand, the weakness of demand, which has led to a more marked decline in overnight prices, with a 16 per cent decline in the average overnight price over the previous five months.
However, market turnover in March, April and May grew by 78 per cent, 199 per cent, 35 per cent, order number by 141 per cent, 152 per cent, 50 per cent, and receiving by-call by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.
The Report notes that the development of the shared accommodation industry has long been promising, but many uncertainties remain in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research of the National Information Centre in Phongxia stated to the Journal of Workers that the development of shared accommodation required stronger policy support, on the one hand, through better implementation of pre-existing policies, further strengthening of policy coherence, with a focus on creating a better business environment, and, on the other hand, further increased policy orientation and support in a wide range of areas, such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovative service delivery and strengthening cooperation between government and platform enterprises.

Solorio said that 21 people had died at the factory since April, 9 of whom were trade unionists.
As a result of strict sanitary measures in the factory, workers are at risk of contracting the virus outside the factory.
According to the trade union, the factory had more than 7,000 employees.
As at 25 July, Mexico had accumulated more than 385,000 confirmed cases, with over 40,000 deaths, and Mexico was the fourth country with the highest number of new deaths worldwide.
China's famous vascular Surgery Centre, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, signed a contract with the Xiamen University-affiliated Xiaoshan Hospital for vascular Surgery to set up a collaboration centre to promote communication and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, particularly in the field of aortic acute diseases, on 26 July.
As a result of the formal collaboration between the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, Chinasan Hospital, which is affiliated with China, will conduct remote consultations, develop treatment programmes with the real-time on-line consultations of the Yanghai hospital, select people for refresher training, conduct weekly joint surgical exchanges, study rooms, etc., and, in the case of complex cases, invite the Changhai specialists to operate in the hospital, depending on the patient ' s needs, so that the south-west patients can enjoy the best medical resources in the country without going to the provinces.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative surgical research, aorta disease and early screening, among others.
A workshop on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Nakayama Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
During the same period, the two recognized hospitals held a signing ceremony for the collaboration centre for angiology, at which they announced that they would work together to raise the level of treatment for angio-surgery-related diseases in the south-west of Guan.
The vascular Surgery of Shanghai Hospital is the only vascular Surgery Institute of the Army and the only clinical centre for vascular system diseases in Shanghai City, as well as the first major national vascular Surgery programme, leading the establishment of the Specialized Committee on Aerovasculars of the Chinese Medical Doctors ' Association, which is the top team with deep in-house insinuation.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Avascular Surgery, Nakayama Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, gave an interview with the media.
The Angio Surgery of the Nakayama Hospital, a subsidiary hospital, was the first independent discipline in Fujian province, with a long-term commitment to the treatment of aorta and peri-vascular diseases, and in 2018 was approved for the construction of a provincial clinical priority specialist.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of mesosphere aneurysm and aorta, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysm in emergency cases.
“From the history of development, the breadth, difficulty, complexity of the operation, etc., of the Xiamen Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, is so remarkable in the region that we have set up a collaboration centre which, in addition to the aorta, has the potential to carry out medical, pedagogical and scientific in-depth cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower limb arteries, the carotid arteries, etc.”.
Professor Feng Wei, Deputy Director of Avascular Surgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Chinashan Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 for the establishment of the “Li Moxen Hospital” for digestive internal medicine.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, the head of the institution ' s vascular surgery, in an interview with a Chinese-new network journalist, said that the institution ' s vascular surgery had also had a long history of exchanges with the Changhai hospital, and that the two hospitals had formally formed a collaboration unit to bring the two partners back to the new steps.
He said that the Institute would regularly invite Shanghai experts to exchange surgical techniques, study rooms, discuss difficult cases, etc., and further remote consultations, which were currently planned once a week; in addition, the Unit would also select personnel for further exchanges to enhance the development and development of the academic workforce.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China and that the aorta, as the main artery of the human body ' s organs, had an important role to play in the flow from the heart to the whole body.
The incidence of aorta diseases is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the roughest aorta having a diameter of up to 4 cm, and the risk of haemorrhaging is high once an vascular tumor is formed, there is a breakdown, or a membrane rupture produces a membrane.
In recent years, as the lifestyle of people has changed and the rhythm of life has accelerated, China has become the world ' s largest high blood pressure, with the attendant increase in aortic diseases, and the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a small, rapid and efficient manner, along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials.
Doctors can “variate” the blood flow appropriately by punctuating from the thigh and putting the rack in the aorta so as to avoid the impact of an aneurysm or a ruptured lacuna, with good therapeutic effects, some of which require even a local anesthesia.
More than a dozen national experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aorta diseases and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and challenge case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, journalists were informed that, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is continuing to develop in a small, rapid and efficient manner.

This is also the second big film that was chosen to be webcast after "Mom" .
The expedition, adapted from an online game of the same name, described the death of Dong Yilong and Chu's samurai from the village of Qinggen, who embarked on a journey for the selection of Chief Marshal Ma of the army of Nan Zhao, on the way to meet Kim Gung Xiao's sister and three of them to carry out their mission together.
This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the game's “Travel” IP, and the launch of the same-name film is undoubtedly also a tribute to the classic game.

The map shows the construction site of the tri-channel tunnel.
The Sino-Chang Dynasty Group's supply chart.
On 26 July, a journalist (journalist Han Yong) in Chongqing, China, was informed by the Chinese Railways Chengdu Group Ltd., that the entire length of the JUNH-HUNT-HUN III JUNG tunnel, about 18.9 km long, was fully operational on that day.
It is understood that the tri-gorge tunnel is not only the longest high-iron tunnel within the three-thmus reservoir, but is also the longest single-hole two-hour high-iron tunnel under construction in the country, designed to reach 350 km per hour.
On the territory of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, which are located in the city of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, Xu, Xu, Xu, Xu, Xiao, Xiang, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Xiang, Xiang, Xiang, Xiang, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Xiang, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, Qing, is an important part of our “eight, eight, and eight” high-speed railway network.
The entire 26-day line of the San Gorge tunnel was opened.
The figure is field-connected.
The new line was built about 818 km long, designed at a speed of 350 km/hour, and approximately 184 km in Chongqing, in Henan Province, in the city of Chengzhou, in the south-west, in the city of Ping Pyeongshan, in the city of Namyang, in the province of Xiaoyang, in the province of Hubei, and in the city of Wanzhou.
Of these, the Chonzhou-Xiangyang Sector became operational as early as 1 December 2019, and the Chongqing Sector is stepping up its construction.
The 26-day-long, all-round, tri-gorge tunnel is a line-wide control project for Jung Mangau, which is located on the border between Chongqing and Sooshan counties and is approximately 18.9 km long and buried at a maximum depth of 890 metres.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and became fully operational on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, the chief of the design of the Chinese Iron II School Engineering Group of China, the company limited in responsibility, Zheng Wan, the Royal Army, the site of the San Gorge Tunnel is in very complex geological conditions, exposed to the risks of rock solubility, mud pouring water, large-scale osmosis of soft rock, and high-risk tunnels of level I, the design and construction of which are extremely difficult.
“In the course of the construction of the project, we adopted special designs for more than 30 types of solution holes, using expansive geological predictions such as geological survey methods, object-searching methods, and super-drive drilling methods. For example, a 24-metre-long bridge was designed to cross a large solution hole with a vertical length of more than 10 metres and a depth of more than 55 metres in the tunnel to avoid the fall of the tunnel.” The Army of the Kingdom said.
According to the construction side ' s Central Iron Tunnel Authority, the tunnel was constructed by means of a combination of decomposition, the construction of cross-choles, slurry, reinforced tunnel structure support and sewage treatment stations, both to ensure orderly engineering progress and to avoid damage to the water bodies of the three canyons, while successfully overcoming the construction difficulties of poor geological conditions, such as a 7-kilometre soft rock deformation, the maximum daily influx of water amounting to 157,000 cubic metres, etc.
With the completion of the entire railway line, Cheng Wan, it will become the country ' s new accessible and rapid passenger main road to the south-west, north-east and central regions. It will be important to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east to the railway, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote the development of regional coordination and promote the implementation of the Western Great Development Strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the United States census for the allocation of seats in the House.
A number of civil rights organizations and several United States cities and counties have prosecuted the United States federal Government, claiming that attempts by the Trump Presidency to exclude undocumented migrants from the United States census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sara Brannon, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union's executive lawyer, said to the American Voice, “This cannot be done”.
She went on to say that Trump called for the determination of the citizenship of the persons to be surveyed in the census to be difficult and “not very reliable”.
The administrative order of Trump was challenged on Thursday by another civil liberties organization, the Joint Careers Organization.
A number of cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the proceedings.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the proceedings on Friday.
The Chairman of the Governing Board of Arlington County, Garvey, said, “The United States Constitution requires an accurate census of our population every 10 years. We must take an accurate inventory of everyone living in Arlington County and not let this illegal attempt to scare people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive decree.
According to the Minister of Justice of Alabama, Marshall, the executive order was a “win” for the state.
He said that “the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly and the electoral college of the Länder must be based on the number of inhabitants residing in the Länder and the number of legal residents”.
Last year, the United States Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to regulate the submission of unlicensed census data by the United States Census Bureau's Secretary of Commerce, Ross, in order to allow the Administration to exclude these undocumented populations from state census figures and to determine whether each state has increased or reduced or maintained the number of members of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years, depending on demographic changes.
In Chongqing, 33 districts and districts are hit by heavy rains, and local emergency level IV response is activated.
On 26 July, Xinhua Xinqing (journalist Ko Goyang, Li Song), a journalist from Chongqing City's drought control command, learned that Chongqing City began a new wave of heavy rains on 25 July, with heavy rains in 33 districts, four small and medium-sized rivers with over-alert water level flooding, and an emergency response level IV has been launched on the ground.
According to the General Hydrological Monitoring Station in Chongqing City, between 0800 hours on 25 and 0800 hours on 26 June, the main area of Chongqing reached heavy rains, with heavy rains in 33 districts, including Jiangjin, Jiang and Wulong, among which heavy rains in 16 districts, including Huanzhou, Yunyang and Nankawa.
The largest amount of daily rainfall occurred in the village of Ryushan in the town of Jinshan in Nanchon, at 197.5 mm.
As a result of the heavy rainfall, the river of donkeys in the Jiangjin region, the river of oil in the Yangtze region, the river of the Kaizhou region, and the four small and medium-sized rivers in the Yunyang district have been flooded, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rains also led to a landslide in the village of six wells in the territory of the Vulon district, disrupting road traffic on the village road, slipping into the tributary of the river, blocking the riverway to form a lake of dysentery, and urgently organizing a downstream mass transfer on the ground.
In response to the storm, at 1300 hours on 26 June, the Chongqing City Anti-Drough Drought Command issued an early warning message on river flood level III and launched an emergency response on level IV, calling on the relevant districts and units to reinforce their patrols, mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely manner, and evacuate the population of the threatened areas.
Responding, promoting industrial projects -- looking at the headlines -- Hunan Daily News -- on-line
Summer's Hunan, hot waves over the face.
On the other hand, the enthusiasm unleashed by the Provincial Industry Project Building and Promotion of the Field Watch, built over a three-volt of heat, inspired by the clear orientation of “Industry vs. Project Heroes”.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the training industry.
In the first half of the year, under the strong central leadership of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the province insisted on a single game of chess, dedicated to the fight against the disease, the fight against the disease, and the industrial project as a “battle of first hand” for the implementation of the S6S.
From a 1.9 per cent decline in GDP in the quarter to a 1.3 per cent increase in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period and the magnitude of the effort is self-evident.
On this highly valuable report card, industrial project construction is the key underpinning for accelerated economic recovery and stable development in Hunan.
It's good, it's unreversible.
The construction of industrial projects has to be carried out in a way that is both dynamic, aggressive, resourceful and resilient to change.
In the context of the current complex and serious international situation, in addition to the enormous effort to attract resources, it is necessary to study the new features of the current situation, to be more regular, to be more scientifically precise and to be better integrated into the new development landscape, which is dominated by the domestic and international cycles, which are mutually reinforcing.
Increased focus on the upgrading of industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavy-level investment projects in new and emerging industries begin to develop, but also created hope, and more traditionally advantaged industries accelerated their deployment in digitalization, intelligence, greening and industrial transformation.
The Yooyang Oscon III Science Park project has adapted the existing production lines, leading to the acquisition of intelligent production lines for high-end printed circuit boards; the new plant area of the Changde tobacco factory in Hunan is dedicated to the intellectual transformation, the construction of a modern plant, and a living picture of the “old tree's new bud” . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Increased focus on fostering new paradigms for the development of the new economy.
The sudden emergence of the new crown epidemic, which brought a “clouds economy” to the fore, inspired the potential of the digital economy and offered new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the manufacturing of computer and office equipment, electronic and telecommunications equipment in our province grew by 12.6 per cent, the retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit grew by 32.2 per cent, and the online food bill in catering businesses by 35.6 per cent.
The emergence of new mechanisms in the crisis, the creation of new players in the change board, the active promotion of digital industrialization, the digitization of the industry, and the development of the digital economy and the integration of the real economy are the main trends.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the supporting enterprises are out of the province and there is still room and potential on the chain.
The strengthening of the industry chain thinking capture project involves not only continuous accumulation of head enterprises and technological breakthroughs at key points in the industry chain; it also requires local subliminal nurturing to stimulate chain chain reaction with a strong chain-refilling chain extension, and the promotion of ancillary industry co-arrangement to accelerate the building of autonomous, secure and secure chain supply chains.
Dramatic and business-oriented, Hunan continues to be a hot, ecstatic land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
“Acceleration” of high-quality development as a result of the “deficit” of the enterprise's relief, has been a frequent, new and practical move throughout the province; “shareholder-type” services have been introduced in Xuanyang, where business has not been pushed, policy has not failed, problems have not been resolved overnight ... In the process of recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, there are various “many ways” to find short-term pains, and live stories of what has become a crisis.
A focus on industrial research, the nurturing of industry, the development of industry and the solid optimization of the business environment must win the favor of more investors.
While the wind is still on the front, the state of the storm has become the norm of building industrial projects and promoting high-quality development throughout the province.
During this critical period, it is important to learn and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions of Xi Jinping's Secretary-General, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with certainty in his own work, to sustain the construction of industrial projects, to share passion and sweat, and to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the full realization of a small and prosperous society.

To foster a new business, open a new space for employment - a new network in the middle.
New forms of employment have emerged, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced, contributing to the growth of new forms of employment.
According to the latest data of the National Statistical Office, the rate of unemployment in the National Urban Survey in June was 5.7 per cent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the result of the national urban survey, since April, of the two consecutive drops in unemployment rates, which have been followed by a monthly decline in unemployment data, as well as the emergence of new and emerging employment opportunities.
The more than 5,000 wages a month, coupled with the new sense of embrace of information technology, have given Guo Mei increasing energy.
At the innovative incubation base in the transition and transformation demonstration area in Shanxi, there were more than 2,300 data labelers.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a “temperature” - a new net.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows a “temperature” of the economy.
Journalist, Economic Daily, China Economic Network, Lin Fing Chan.
During the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, our country has made concerted efforts to prevent and control the epidemic and to promote economic and social development. The situation has continued to improve. The steady recovery of the economy is evident. Employment and price performance, which are closely related to human life, have generally stabilized, and the Chinese economy has handed over a temperature-based economic performance report.
During the first two months of the year, there was an increase in the survey unemployment rate.
In particular, in February, production operations in many enterprises were largely halted, demand for labour in enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and unemployment in urban surveys increased.
With the gradual improvement in the situation with regard to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the entire social fabric of productive life has been restored.
In keeping with the general thrust of the Party ' s efforts to secure a stable and medium-sized job, the Party ' s central government has further intensified the macroeconomic policy and has strengthened its employment priorities in a comprehensive manner, as well as actively promoting the promotion of job security and employment expansion.
We have stepped up our policies to stabilize jobs, set up a policy combination of “reduced and remedial” policies, phased out the contributions of the three social insurance units, allowed for a delay in the payment of social insurance contributions, expanded the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefited from the policy of job replacement, and provided subsidies for the inclusion of priority groups in the employment of enterprises, internship subsidies, etc.
With the poor implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for employment in enterprises has risen steadily, the employment situation has gradually improved, the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined and the survey unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent in June.
The Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Statistical Office, Zhang Yi, stated that employment policies continued to work in the second quarter, with the gradual return of the labour force that had withdrawn from the previous period due to the effects of the epidemic, and that the urban labour force participation rate increased by about 10 percentage points from February in June, close to the same level last year.
The data show that total urban employment grew by more than 19 per cent in June compared to February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemiological levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises amounted to 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours more than in February and 0.1 hours more than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January of this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching its highest level in many years.
In February, the year-on-year increase of CPI, though slightly reversed, remained in “5 Zones”.
CPI's year-on-year increase is high, with both pre-spring consumer demand pull factors and spring staggered and same-year base factors.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
As a result of the epidemic, logistical delays, the untimely supply of supplies and the increased cost of transporting goods were experienced throughout the country in January and February, as well as a number of citizens hoarding and buying, which led to a marked increase in the price of some of the necessities of life.
In response to the disturbance of the price situation caused by the epidemic, the authorities have included vital goods in emergency transport guarantees and ensured their smooth movement.
The market supply of vegetable melon fruit is strongly secured through a range of policy initiatives.
In response to the rapid rise in the prices of pork at the beginning of this year, the Central Government introduced a policy of price stabilization, which led to rapid implementation in all regions and sectors, a marked improvement in the supply of stocks of pork, an orderly restoration of the productive capacity of pigs, and a gradual normalization of the order of production and distribution.
Since March, prices of pork have been declining continuously, with the year-on-year rise in food prices falling back to 10.6 per cent in May and a slight increase in the price of pork ring in June, influenced by factors such as a slowdown in the birth of pigs, a decrease in imports and a rebound in demand for group consumption.
Seasonal variations in the prices of fresh food were marked, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the higher comparison base over the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to fall year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transport logistics, local supply security has increased and market supply and demand have improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring declined for four months in a row, from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and price levels generally recovered flat.
In the second half of the year, prices will continue to remain moderate and overall inflationary pressures will remain low, but the return to productive life will still have to be promoted in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters, such as floods, droughts and other natural disasters in the main agricultural areas, such as food, fruit and vegetables, and strengthen market regulation in a determined manner to combat the destabilizing market order, such as the hoarding of quirks and the uplifting of prices.

Heilongjiang launched a campaign to clean up the new Chinese network with the name of a well-known hospital.
In recent years, irregularities and inappropriateness in the names of some health-care institutions have led to misleading attempts on the part of the population to seek medical treatment by using the name of a well-known health-care institution without legal authorization.
Upon enquiry into the National Corporate Credit Information System, the names of registered medical institutions in Heilongjiang province included the names of well-known medical institutions, such as “association” and the use of well-known hospitals, such as “consortium”, to operate abroad, disrupting the normal medical order and causing adverse social effects.
At the same time, it will be used as an opportunity to carry out a variety of legal literacy campaigns to raise awareness of the responsibilities of market subjects, of the protection of rights under the law and of the conduct of business in compliance with the law.
A number of typical cases of adverse effects are brought to the attention of society through the open access to complaint channels, with a deterrent effect.
30 competing electric projects have been registered, Shanghai Pudong to expand the new economic "New Race" - Xinhua Net
On July 24, Xinhua, Xinhua City electricity (journalist Tengjani), on the ground in the East New District of Shanghai, 30 priority electric competition projects, ranging from pavilion, competition to business, cover the whole category of electric competitive industry development, and are expected to generate an additional $10 billion in the regional electric game industry.
The digital culture industry, represented by electric games, will become a new growth point for the new online economy in Pudong, helping to build a global electricity capital in Shanghai.
In the case of electric competitions, on the basis of existing high-level arenas, such as the Mae Ben Cultural Centre, the Orient Sports Centre and others, new ones, such as the Puradong football stadium, the Specialized Electronic Space Senlan Electric Pavilion and the East Chang Gaming Space, have been identified as landing sites in Pudong.
Wang Hyeon, General Manager of the Senlan Landing of the Upper Overseas High Bridges Group, told journalists that an indoor complex of about 1,500 square metres could accommodate 1,000 people, and that construction was under way, with the introduction of the competition expected next March, with 120,000 square metres of green park next to the competition, and the introduction of recreational elements, such as a moving double dollar, in conjunction with the electric general entertainment industry.
With regard to the electric accoutrements industry, Pudong has focused on improving the industrial chain layout.
The world’s champions, such as the team of Uber Dragons, have opened their doors at the signing event, and the country’s only video game digitized channel – the game – has moved to Pudong.
On the side of the race, Pudong actively sought to bring the top international and domestic races to the ground and to create an undefeated electric season.
A series of electric competitions, such as the International Cup of Peace Excellence 2020, and the Xi'ar electric competition, were announced in Pudong.
On the business side, Pudong focuses on promoting the landing of head enterprises.
For example, Naohara's plan to launch dozens of game products in Pudong will also actively launch new projects aimed at generating 10 billion yuan in revenue, as will the blizzard, perfect world, fun games, and so on.
Statistics show that the current electric game industry in Pudong accounts for one third of Shanghai.
A number of top players, such as tungsten, web-lave, head games, have landed in the field, and a group of top players, such as the TI9, the King's Glory Winter Games, are taking place in Pudong, which is becoming a “strong heart” for the development of the Shanghai electric competitive industry.
The concentration of high-quality competitive industries in Pudong is also dependent on the support of relevant policies.
In the recent past, the Chinese Academy of Game Industries has landed in Pudong, setting high standards for industry.
Pudong's group-star vocational school was awarded the “Shanghai Pilot School for Vocational Education and Electronic Competing”, which lays the foundation for the development of talent in the electronics industry.
The registration of electric athletes took the lead in Puradong, further increasing the level of professionalization of electric campaigners.
The Director of the Humanist Tourism Bureau of Pudong District, Huang Xing, said that, around the goal of building a “global electricity capital” in Shanghai, Pudong had proposed the construction of “a core functional area for the development of the electricity industry in Shanghai”.
The next step, Pudong, will continue to focus on the main events, priority enterprises, and accelerate development and the formation of industrial chains.
Using the policy of the Shanghai free-trade pilot zone to pre-test and explore innovations for upgrading the overall development of the electricity-competing industry, developing replicable and replicable experiences.

Today, the opening of the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the opening of the first Red Cultural Industry Expo is held in Sasayama.
The Festival of Red Tourism Culture was opened by the Minister of Communication of the Provincial Council and the Provincial Council, Zhang Hongsen, and was addressed by Vice-Governor U Kwai Ying.
The Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival, which was successfully held, is a well-known brand of red tourism throughout the country.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Communication of the Provincial Council, the Department of Culture and Tourism of the Province and the Municipality of the Central Committee of the Lao People ' s Democratic Republic.
He said that it was important to follow up on the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to “use red resources well, build red traditions well, transmit red genes well” and further pursue our development of red tourism, promote the revival of the Brunei market, and bring the “red forces” together into a broad convergence of efforts to build a rich, beautiful, happy new lake south.
The promotion of the red culture, the transmission of the red spirit, the stimulation of tourism consumption and the promotion of the quality development of the Hunan Brigade will certainly play a more active role.

As an artist, communication is very important to me.
And through my work of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature, but that everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago for the first time, and I saw the iceberg for the first time.
I feel God-fearing.
My heart was beating fast, dizzy, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The icebergs around me surface almost 200 feet above me, and I can only find it strange that this is a snowflake that covers another snowflake, formed year after year.
The icebergs are formed when they break apart from the glaciers or from the ice racks.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surrounding environment and their situation in a clear way.
Some of the icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, and some of the icebergs can't stand a flash of passion and avalanche.
And when you look at the icebergs, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're independent, they're all single, more like how we humans feel about ourselves sometimes.
But the reality is far beyond that.
With the melting of the iceberg, I breathed into its ancient scent.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh mineral-rich water that feeds everything.
I started filming these icebergs as if I were filming the portraits of my ancestors, and I realized at these individual moments that the icebergs existed in that way, but never again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some of which are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg that I filmed on Kekertsuatsiak, Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity for you to actually be able to witness an iceberg roll.
So that's what the figure says.
On the left you can see a boat.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg and its deformation on the water.
Here you see it starts to roll, the boat moves to the other side, a man standing there.
It's an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaces about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
The video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of your personality.
Thank you.

Qinghai Lakeside's Flower Room: 'Sweet' with the help of farmers - China's new net

Mardi Gras.
On July 26th, China's new network Qinghai Hainan called "The Flower Room" on Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" with goods to help farmers increase their harvest.
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yuji.
“On the shores of the summer Qinghai lake, with golden flowers, bees flying, high altitude, great day and night temperatures, low air pollution, strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bees, creating the characteristics of the Qing Sea Hornet magma with high activity, high protein, rich in nutrients, low sugar and low lipid.”
On 26 June, the Deputy Director-General of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous State Industrial and Information Authority of Qinghai Province, Zhang Jian-hoon, stated that
On that day, a live delivery of the products of the “Synchronous War Pulmonary for Agriculture” was held on the shores of Lake Qinghai, where the Chinese Bee Products Association, together with representatives of entrepreneurs and bee farmers, came together to promote Qinghai-specific bee products, selling a total of almost 10,000 bottles of the Qinghai Plateau bee magma under the line line, with a total cargo of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The map shows bee products at the bee farmer's site.
According to the information received, the live feed campaign, with the help of a network of well-known domestic bee businesses, such as Beijing's Khydrome business chains, fast-hands, poaching and others, live and electric platforms, has led to exchanges and cooperation between “business + bee farmers + growers” and to the continued distribution of “Chamber magma coupons” to consumers, both online and through offline channels, with a total expected annual return of nearly $5.28 million.
In this regard, the President of Beijing's Khydrome Beehives Corporation, Inc., Xuana, said that it was “very worthwhile”: “This could increase the visibility of the Qinghai Bee product, attract more consumers to know, prefer and add nothing to the pure natural bee product, and lead to an increase in the bee farmer's harvest.”
At present, the company has entered into a production cooperation strategic agreement with the Qinghai Cloud Bee Industries Ltd. and the Qinghai Pau Bees Co-operatives Company to jointly promote the development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.

In the spring, the passage of roads around the country, which necessitated the prevention and control of the epidemic, was blocked by the way the bee farmers “go after the nectar”, and many of the bees died as a result of missed flowers and lack of food, with a severe impact on the income of the bee farmers.
“As a year goes by, the bee farmers travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan to the north to the north and to the north-west, and they have a hard time living in open and unsettled accommodation.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Guna called it.
“Bees are `environmental scouts', and highly contaminated regional bees cannot survive.” Zhao Xiaochuan, Managing Director of the Chinese Bee Products Association, explained that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in preserving plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the quality of crops, especially in widely grown and poorly managed areas.
Research data show that pollination increases the production of oilseeds by about 15 - 30 per cent.
The figure shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right) as the Managing Vice-President of the Chinese Bee Products Association.
“The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are much greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential for human health, crop production, vegetation, and ecological protection, which has always been poorly known.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said so.
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and there are many poor households that are unable to move, in addition to year-rounding bee farmers, to opt for beeboxing as stock cooperatives.
“The State has financial support, we have contacts with technical staff to help guide, the lack of knowledge and judgment of the market environment among bee farmers, and the need for the help and coordination of Governments, enterprises and industry associations to open the market.
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
“I hope that in the future more attention will be paid to and assistance will be given to the bee-keeping community,” Guna said, “Our bee products are also screened and regulated in strict accordance with national standards, ensuring quality and protecting consumer rights while helping bee farmers”.
As a result of the continuing rains, since 22 July, the mosaic following the landslide in the mid-level group of the camp of six wells in Chongqing Wulong district has broken apart, resulting in large-scale slide-shifting deformations and a complete break-off of the last river, resulting in the formation of 13 metres of water in front of the dam, with an estimated reservoir capacity of about 550,000 cubic metres.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the soybean beach.
According to the Meteorological and Hydrological Department of Chongqing, from 25 to 25, heavy rains have been prevalent in the mid-western and north-eastern areas of Chongqing, as well as heavy rains in some parts of the country.
On the evening of 26 December, the small river dam station will appear at the highest water level, with the highest level approaching the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the Soyuz Beach.
Following an emergency meeting between the Chongqing City Office and the meteorological, hydro, hydrological and other departments and units, the Chongqing City Command for Drought Control decided to release early warning information on river flood level III and to initiate emergency response on level IV.
The Chongqing City Anti-Drough Control Command demanded that the Chongqing, Qingbei, Shaping Dam, Xuannan, Vulong districts and the Chongqing municipality pay high attention to rainwater conditions, in particular, the Yangtze, Kayang, Ugang, the changes in water, the early analysis, the issuance of early warning, the strengthening of patrol duties, the resolute evacuation of people in threatened areas, the timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and supplies, the rapid and efficient management of disaster situations and the avoidance of mass casualties.
The Minister-Counsellor Chung of the Embassy of Viet Nam in Laos, representatives of the Lao Buddhist Association of Viet Nam, the General Lao Vietnamese People ' s Congress, representatives of Vientiane Province, the Lao Veterans ' Association, etc. participated in the ceremony.
The ceremonial ceremony was held in a solemn and solemn atmosphere, and representatives continued to fragrant the British, remembering their great service and their special ties of solidarity with the elderly.
In his address, the Minister Counsellor, Chung, expressed the view that this was an opportunity to remember, together with the Laos, the greatness of the two revolutions and to express our gratitude for the sacrifices made for their independence and freedom, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked together to fight the common enemy, for national independence, for national unity, for the common building of national development and for the consolidation of relations between the two countries.
Seventy-four years ago, on 23 January 1946, 28 fighters of the old Viet Nam fighting coalition were bravely killed in the attack on the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of the offensive became a historic victory for both countries in the early stages of the struggle for a national liberation revolution.
Ms. Chung stressed that the peoples of the two countries would always bear in mind the sacrifices made in the cause of the struggle for national liberation, while stressing that the young regions of the two countries would continue to build on the heroic and strong traditions of their predecessors and make their due contribution to the continued fruits of the old relations and to the prosperous development of the two countries.

Greenfield opens a new round of mix-up, and Shanghai State funds are to transfer 17.5% of the shares.
On July 26, the Green Land Holdings (600606.SH) issued an indicative notice of a State-owned shareholder's intention to agree on the transfer of a part of the company's shares and a relic by means of a public call on the transferees.
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of State-owned investments, and improve the structure of green land equity, Upper Haiti (Governance) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Upper Haiti”) and Shanghai (Governance) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanghai Capital”) Ltd. intend to transfer part of the company's shares held by public call to the grantor by agreement, with a total share to be transferred not exceeding 17.5 per cent of the total stock of the Greenland.
The price of this proposed transfer of shares is not less than the average arithmetical average of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days (27 July 2020) of the indicative announcement day; and the audited net asset value of each of the companies in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in the greenfield remain open and, according to the announcement, it is estimated that the 17.5 per cent of the equity transferred in this mix of greenfields will need to be disbursed in the order of $14 billion.
It is noteworthy that, after the transfer of the shares has been completed, it is expected that the green land will remain free of controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but that the control structure may change significantly.
Since its creation, green land holdings have undergone a number of institutional reforms: 1992-1997, operating under a purely State-owned system in accordance with market-based rules; 1997-2013, establishing and continuously improving State-owned, worker-owned shares; 2013-2015, introducing strategic investors to form a mixed and integrated system of State-owned and non-public capital holding; and 2015-present, as a whole, as a public company.
The current mix-up programme in the Greenlands is similar to that of Girón, which, in December 2019, took over 15 per cent of the shares of the Glycerine Electric (000651.SZ) at $41,662 million with the title of High Cap Capital, which, after completing the mix-up, implemented modern business management practices such as the High Management Incentive Scheme, the Uncontrolled People ' s Structure, etc.
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Greenlands Consort, Zhang Yu Liang, who was the owner of the Shanghai National Investment Commission, stated that the green land initiative was an important step towards comprehensive reform of State-owned enterprises in Shanghai and the acceleration of a new phase of reform of State-owned enterprises, in accordance with the central requirements of the party, and was a full demonstration of the new and tailored approach to reform, through the introduction of new high-quality strategic shareholders to listed companies, and support to enterprises in further enhancing marketization, increasing the freedom of business management and accelerating the overall release of the dynamic of reform.

The products “Shanghai to Lang Creek” and “Sunday's Two Day Tours” were carefully introduced and sold out less than a week after their launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that because of the epidemic, she has not been out this year.
“As soon as we saw a group tour, we shared the news with our friends and signed up, never came to Lang Creek before, and looked forward to the trip.” Aunt Sun said.
It is understood that in September last year the city of Lang Creek signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (GATT) Ltd. for the “Ride by High Iron River Creek” project, which plans to launch 12 trips of high iron tourism from Jiang Quan to Lang Creek within one year.

It's too early for the White House advisors to come back to work in the "anti-bite" states.
On 23 July, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, United States President Trump has repeatedly called for the resumption of work in all the states of the country until recently, when he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear a mask in public, while his advisers “retreat” that some state governments were premature.
On 22 December, at a press conference, the White House presidential adviser, Kyliean Conway, stated that some state governments had failed to comply with the criteria for re-entry and had prematurely reopened places such as bars.
Conway also referred to earlier rumours that the President had “absolute power” to decide on the resumption of work in the states.
“The President is a federalist who believes in state autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the rumours in Conway were made by Trump himself at a White House outbreak briefing on 13 April.
This self-punishment of self-punishment has been mocked by the Internet as a “rew history”.
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Gretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan, a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a stoppage of work.
Trump wants to press back to work so he can hold a rally.
It's not the first time Karen Conway's been controversial.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, said, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to have understood the word "19" as a version number, with the Internet raving: reading newspapers without common sense!
Recently, we've seen the impact of cyberattacks on the commercial world.
The data leaks from companies like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Jiabao, and Tajik department stores have led to hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars in losses.
A few more of these attacks, and the world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management experienced a very serious data leak.
Security clearances and fingerprints were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers, trying to use stolen data to influence election results in some countries.
The most recent two are the large-scale theft of data by the German Bundestag, and the e-mail theft by the National Democratic Council of the United States.
Cyberthreats have affected our democratic process.
And there is a growing trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect the data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, uses natural microparticles to significantly increase computer computing capabilities.
It's so powerful that it can decipher many of the encryption systems that we're using today.
So are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing electronic survival equipment to meet the coming end of data?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers just exist in the lab, and it's gonna take years before they actually work.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that did not exist in nature, and I was very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology is exciting to me.
Today, some of the selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the practical application stage.
Exactly.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How do you do that?
First, let's get a quick look at the encrypted world.
You need a briefcase, you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It has a special password lock, and once it's locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you send this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase hasn't arrived, you call him and tell him the code.
Once he's got the briefcase, entered the password, and the document was deciphered, it was perfect, and you managed to deliver an encrypted message to James Bond.
A funny example, but it shows the three priorities of encryption.
Password -- what we call encryption keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the code that call.
We call it the key transfer.
This guarantees us the safe delivery of the key to the designated location.
And the locks used to encrypt and decipher files.
We call it the encryption algorithm.
By the key, it converts the contents of the document to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it's hard to crack a password without a secret key.
The significance of algorithms is that if someone gets the briefcase, opens it, doesn't have the key, doesn't know the encryption algorithm, they can't read what's in the document.
Got just some random numbers.
Most of the security systems rely on secure key transmission, which transmits the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power jeopardizes many of the key transmissions that we are currently using.
By way of example, we are now applying a very extensive system -- RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 billion years to crack a 426-digit RSA key.
And in 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computers get stronger, so do the passwords we need.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the cryptographers and the dispensers is ongoing, and they all want to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will quickly decipher complex mathematical algorithms, which are the basis of the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, the quantum computer will turn our safe castle into a touch-down card house.
We're going to try to protect our castle.
A number of research institutions have emerged in recent years to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three priorities of encryption, high-quality key, secure key transfer, and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first thing to hit is the key.
Random numbers are the basis on which the key is formed.
But by today, they're not really random anymore.
Now, we're generating the key, based on random digital frequencies, generated by software, which we call false random numbers.
Programmatic or mathematically generated numbers, there's always some, maybe not so obvious patterns in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or, in terms of terminology, the lower the cylindrical content, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos were attacked in a very creative way.
They shot the tiger machine for a while, then analyzed it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a fake random digital generator behind the wheel.
So they have a great chance of predicting the turn of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for generating a secure password.
For years, researchers have been trying to make a real random digital generator.
But most of the design, it's either not random enough, it's not fast enough, it's hard to reuse.
But the quantum world is really random.
It is very important to take advantage of this genuine randomity.
A device capable of measuring the quantum effect can produce a very fast sequence of random digital streams.
There's no possibility of the casino crime we're talking about.
A number of universities and companies from around the world are concentrating on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born in a 2 metre wide optical table.
And then we narrow it down to a box size.
Today, we can put it on a PCI card, stick it on a normal computer.
This is the fastest speed in the world, the real random digital generator.
By measuring the quantum effect, it produces a billion random numbers per second.
Today has been widely used around the world to enhance the safety of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we still face the second major cyber security threat: the safe transmission of the key.
The current key transfer technology is unable to counter quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem, called Quantum Key Distribution, QKD, uses a basic quantum mechanics counterintuitive properties.
Observing the behavior of microparticles will change the particle.
Let me give you an example.
Let's think about it again, and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him, and we use the quantum effect, and we carry this code with a bunch of lasers, and we pass it to James through the normal fiber optics.
Let's assume Dr. Nobbs wants the code.
Fortunately, in trying to intercept this quantum secret key, Dr. Nobb will leave an electronic fingerprint, which James and you can see.
That way the intercepted key will be destroyed.
And the key left behind can provide a powerful protection of the data.
Because this safety mechanism is based on physics fundamentals, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, it's impossible to crack it.
My team and I are working with a number of top universities and the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
Physical networking heralds the advent of a highly interconnected era, where 25-30 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
And if our societies are to function properly in the networked world, then trust in these interconnected systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these amazing innovations, the innovations that make our lives rich and diverse.
Thank you.

The 3-year-old boy's playground was wrecked, so he'll sue the school for damages?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Rule of Law Journal by Wang Si-seok
The playground was wrecked, and the kids got paid, and then they sued the school.
□ Correspondent, Zhao Yifan
During a 3-year-old play in a university playground, Chan was accidentally hit in the head by the softball team when he pitched the ball.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Man's father, as his legal representative, brought the school before the court, asking for an apology for the school's funeral in the place where the incident took place, and paid medical expenses, moral damages, etc., for a total of $20,000.
Recently, the People ' s Court of the Haidian District of Beijing, after hearing the case, decided to dismiss the plaintiff ' s claim on the basis of its finding that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its due security obligations and that Chen had made reparation.
Mr. Wen complains that during his summer vacation in 2019, he brought Man to play in the school playground, where he was trained by the softball team.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen, Mr. Man and many other small friends and parents operate in the safe areas designated by the softball team.
However, Chen, a softball team player, then left during the pitch, causing the softball to fly across the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Man's brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took him to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head wound.
In Mr. Man ' s view, the school court facilities did not meet the relevant safety requirements and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities.
The school ' s fault, which led to the above-mentioned incidents, caused great physical and psychological suffering and caused greater suffering to its family, is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a safety net on the playground and posted regulations, training notices, informing it of the need to be safe from the playground and to be mindful of its own safety, and that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the school “had failed in its duty of safety”.
The court considered that the university involved in the incident was open to the public free of charge and that, while the school had a safety and security obligation in relation to the management of the playground, it was sufficient to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a safety net on the playground, had fulfilled its due security obligations, and Chen Peng also compensated Siu Man for various losses, such as medical expenses and transportation costs, in accordance with an earlier compensation agreement, and the parties agreed to resolve the dispute once and for all.
Later, the parents again claimed the school ' s compensation, and the court ruled against the plaintiff ' s application in its entirety.
Neither of the parties appealed the sentence, which is now in force.
Under article 37 of our Tort Liability Act, schools, as administrators of public places, have an obligation to ensure their safety and security; in the event of damage to others resulting from the actions of a third person, the third person bears responsibility for the tort, while the public places administrator, who fails to meet the obligation of safety and security, bears the corresponding additional responsibility.
The judge stated that since it was most likely, as the administrator of a public place, to have an understanding of the actual situation in the place, to foresee possible dangers and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage at the lowest cost, the law provided for a corresponding duty of protection for the performance of social activities.
In the present case, the duty to ensure the safety and security of the school should be compatible with the social activities it engages in, in particular, the adoption of basic security measures and the duty to inform of hidden risks, for those who enter unspecific areas of the playground that are open to the public free of charge.
Nor is it appropriate in judicial practice to impose excessive safety and security obligations on administrators of public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and the obligation to inform is fulfilled, it may be held that the school is free of fault and is not legally liable.
In addition, in the case of third-party torts, even if the administrator of a public place, such as a school, fails to fulfil his duty of security, his liability is supplemented by damages, which, under the recently promulgated Civil Code, may be recovered from a third person after the administrator has assumed additional responsibility.
Therefore, in such an incident, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after he or she has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then we're going to compare it to some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with three billion bases in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves to live a long life.
There's something super interesting about natural systems.
If we can convert it into our built environment, then the way we build things has great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of our building operations.
And then we need programmed parts that can accept this sequence and that can be folded or reconstructed.
We need some energy to activate, so that we can fold these parts in accordance with the procedure.
We need some kind of error redundancy to make sure that what we're building successfully is what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to realize this self-assembled future.
The first two projects were MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconstructable robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet of protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold, and decode it into a series of angles -- minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 0 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees -- that kind of thing; a series of angles, or a shift, that can be transferred by wire.
Each unit gets its own message -- for example, negative 120 -- it rotates, checks if it rotates in and passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars a lot of people spent making this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passiveness, or passively try to make reorganization programmable.
But it went one step further, and it tried to actually calculate.
Basically embedded in the basic building module of most calculations, the digital logic door, directly into the various parts.
It's with the non-doors.
Each door to be used for calculation has a quadruple, two input quadruple.
One of them is input from the user, just like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that was placed before coming.
And then it gives a three-dimensional output.
This means that users build bricks the way they want to.
It's calculated on the basis of what you've done and your instructions.
Now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
On the left, the input [1,1] equals 0 output, meaning down.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is one output, which is up.
So the real implication is that our structures now contain the blueprints that we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
That means we have some form of self-replicating.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If there's an error, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have a climbable thing that can read it out and an output of one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external command input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, and it's probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing right now.
It's reconstructable and programmed to make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is identical, and they're biased.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you're going to assemble the chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up and programming any structure that you code for -- so in this case, a spiral, a fire situation, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What future does this portend for us?
I think it tells us about these possibilities of self-assembling, self-replicating and self-repair in our physical structures, our buildings and our machines.
There are new programmable features in these parts.
From there you get a new possibility of calculating.
We'll have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can actually be calculated.
What amazing parallel computing and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects that I've shown you are just a small step forward, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you.

In the normal state of epidemic prevention and control, the enthusiasm of people for exercise and fitness rises.
With the gradual liberalization of trans-provincial tourism operations, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed its trans-provincial tourism business from 21 July, and the first weekend after opening, the Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, reached its peak.
The city of destination, which is a popular tourist destination, has a large number of visitors arriving at Xiamen on weekends.
The Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport traffic is dominated by student, tourist and family visits.
The tourist market was gradually warming, with an average of 440 flights per day at Xiamen airport in July, and domestic flights returning to 80 per cent of pre-occupation flights.
Airlines have encrypted air speed lines from Xiamen to the main cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xian, taking over the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of Xiamen ' s travel agencies are on-line with a series of national, inter-provincial and inter-provincial products during the summer season, with team trips dominated by outdoor spots.
In response to summer passenger traffic peaks at railway stations and airports, additional personnel were deployed in areas where people could easily gather, such as the duty counter, security access, etc. Fujian also optimized the “eight-line health code” by sharing and sharing health data with 31 provinces and promoting an orderly revival of the tourism market.
Can Liu Qingyun “dismant” a new spark - Xinhuanet?
The Bomb Specialist 2 announced recently that it would be shown on 24 December as the first-slated film in his life.
The second is still the director of Qureteau, the producer and star of Liu Dewar, and is based on a new story.
The inclusion of the second “nuclear bomb” element has also, it is known, made even more difficult by the challenges faced by the bomb-dismantling experts, as a result of the fact that the predictions, with a few glimpses, have been heart-rending, hugely explosive mushroom clouds, and have been engulfed by fire at airports.
Three years ago, the bomb demolition expert, who was made by the original teamman, won the five-and-one-barrel champion of the year and seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film and Image Award, and Qiuli Ox Liu Dwar became the golden partner of the audience.
This bomb disposal specialist 2 is also another source of hope for new sparks in the ace combination.
The Bomb Specialist 2 tells a whole new story: the former bomb-dismantling expert, Pan Jae-Wu, fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to turn to his fellow bomb-dismantling expert, Joo-Won (Yo Qing Yun-hyun).
The female inspector, who was anxious to solve the case, was also involved, along with Pan's ex-girlfriend, Pon-Ling.
The new role of Liu DeWu is still an expert in bomb demolition, but the complexity of this new role can be seen in the slotting prognosis: a broken leg, a prosthesis, being pursued by Liu Qingyun, who is also an expert in bomb demolition, and being directed by Nini, a former girlfriend.
What was the relationship between the three, what did Liu do at the Shan Island Hotel, what cases were involved in, and what were the turns of his career as a bomb cracker?
It is understood that the main feature of the film is the field viewing of the world landmark architecture in Hong Kong, coupled with the cutting edge of the special effects production team, with the shock of the real visual impact.

On July 26, China-News Network integrated Russian satellite network reports that July 26 is the day of the Russian Navy, and the main parade to celebrate the day of the Navy took place in St. Petersburg and Karangstad.
The Russian President, Putin, the Supreme Commander of the Russian armed forces, arrived in Kalashta to participate in the celebrations, where 15 vessels and submarines were inspected.
On 28 July 2019, local time, a great military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, to celebrate the naval festival.
It was reported that Putin congratulated the Navy officers and the Navy on the day and sailed by boat from the Gulf of Finland next to the ships that were about to take part in the naval parade, and then inspected the troops at the subjective altar.
Putin stated that the Russian naval fleet was equipped with state-of-the-art vessels and special equipment and that the level of equipment was constantly increasing.
Putin, on the parade of the Russian Navy Day, said: “Russian naval fleets possess high-precision-armed warships, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as state-of-the-art aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment”.
On 24 June, local time, a red field parade was held in Russia to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War.
He also indicated that the Russian naval fleet would gain unique advantages by digitizing it and using effective means of defence.
According to reports, the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Naval Day took place in St. Petersburg and Karangstad, with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigate “Captain Kassatov”, the large anti-submarine vessel “Little Admiral Kurakov”, as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Of these, a series of ships performed a static display near the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most striking of which was the cloned Russian first battleship, the Boltava, at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests were able to enter Karangstad during the Navy parade this year.
The last Sunday of July of each year is Russian Naval Day.
The founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, Yang Hong, passed away. He was 86 years old.
On 26 July, the Xinjing newspaper (journalist Liu Xing) issued an obituary by the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, the founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a prominent Chinese commander, a music educator, and a lifetime academic member of the Central Academy of Music, professor Yang Hong, who died on 26 July 2020 at 13.55 p.m. in Beijing, at the age of 86.
Photo from the Beijing Pleasant Choir Network.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, a man from Jiang Sunanjing, who has loved music since childhood.
In 1951, under the command of the Nanjing People's Radio Choir, and in the autumn of 1951, he joined the Shanghai East Division's music department, where he studied from Professor Ja'in Yang and the German commander, Shizmann, and studied the trajectories and reprogramming with the former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he was taught at the Faculty of Music of the Beijing School of Arts Teachers, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Department of Composing and Command of the Central School of Music.
Young Hong founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, with the purpose of “love and devotion”, he led the choir to sing all over the world and won dozens of prizes in important competitions at home and abroad.
The performances of over 30 groups, including the Central Orchestra Choir, the Central National Song and Dance Group, the Orient Song and the Shanghai Choir, were directed, and numerous symphony and choir concerts were held.
Authors include Band Training, Choir Training, Two Songs Writing, Children ' s Songs (up and down) and thesis " Argumental questions of choirs " , " Audio-level layout of orchestras " , as well as the translation of the Cholera Act and the " Debosi ' s Voice " .
Do you know how many blooming plants there are?
There are 250,000 -- at least we know so much -- of the 250,000 blooming plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard to make plants grow.
A great deal of experience and many resources are required.
Why are you so troubled?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what's in your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be in the form of branches; it can breed in the same sex; it can pollinate in the same strain.
But they do need to transmit their genes and mix them with other genes, so that they can eco-environment.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way the plant conveys this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see this.
How many blooming plants have many different kinds of pollen.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get pollen fever comes from the plants that use the wind to spread pollen, which is a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen always comes into our nose.
Because most of them are abandoned, hoping that the reproductive cells that are contained in pollen, the male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grain, and most of the trees spread pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this, and in a way, it's smarter, because it doesn't take too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, divert pollen directly to where it needs to be.
Obviously, we've noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether it's a bird or a bee, and they get a reward, usually for nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship leads to amazing adaptive change -- the red skirt moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also have harvests, and Tsai spread pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolve, create landing runways everywhere, bees may be lost in it.
A lot of plants have some that look like other insect markers.
These are lilies' pollen capsules, very clever, so when the unknowing insect falls on them, the pollen capsule turns over, with a lot of pollen on the back of the insect, so that it can follow the insects to the other plants.
There's an orchid that looks like having a jaw, and in a way, it does; it forces insects to climb, to get pollen, and to bring pollen somewhere else.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 orchids -- a variety of amazing things.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them complete the process.
And this orchid, called Darwin's orchid, because it's been studied by Darwin and given an amazing prediction when he sees this orchid, and you can see that there's a long nectar coming down from the orchid.
Basically what an insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it punctures the mouthpiece into the middle of the middle and knows the nectar all the way down to get the nectar to get the nectar.
Darwin said, "Look at this flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
There's no doubt, it's an insect.
I mean, usually it's all rolled up, but it's straight after, and it looks like that.
Now, imagine, if nectar is so valuable that it's expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may start to cheat on each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Do you want to get some?"
It's a plant.
This plant, which is loved by insects in South Africa, evolved a long mouthpiece to get the nectar at the bottom.
It's an imitator.
This plant mimics the former.
There's a fly with a mouthpiece, and it doesn't get any nectar from the imposter, because the impostor doesn't give it any nectar. It thinks it can get it.
So, not only did the fly not get nectar from a bogus plant, but -- if you look very closely at the top of your head, you'll see that there's some pollen that's going to spread to other plants, if there's no botanist to come and stick it to a blue card.
And that lies spread all over the plant kingdom.
These flowers with black spots: they may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the right species, they look like two very, very sexy females.
When the insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself in pollen, which, of course, will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the image that every family should have of scanning the electron microscope, you can see actually there are patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may sense very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to imitate the surfaces of the metallic light that some beetles see in their beetles.
Under the scanning electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
That's what it's smart about. It's called a black rock.
I think it's sometimes tricky.
For the kind of bees that fit, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it'll fly over and hit it many, many times with its head, try to drive it away, of course, and it'll put pollen on it.
The other thing it does is this plant imitates as another orchid rich in insects' favorite food.
But there's nothing at all.
So it's cheating on two levels -- I can't believe it.
And what we see is Elan, the fragrant part.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't actually have to be so gorgeous.
They spread a wonderful fragrance that attracts any interested insect.
This flower doesn't smell so good.
This flower actually smells very bad again, and it's evolved, and it looks like rotting meat.
So flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
It's white star taro, also known as dead horse taro.
I don't know what the dead horse smells like, but this flower probably smells very much like it.
It's horrible.
The green fly can't help it.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
They lay eggs on them, and they think it's a nice piece of rotting meat, and they don't realize that there's no eggs here, that these eggs will die here, but this plant will benefit, because the hard hair is loose, the flies are gone, pollinating to another flower -- it's amazing.
Here's the taro, the omelet, the zebra's mother, in this country called the long-term grass.
I shot this last week at Dosset.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
And if you look inside it, the back of the veal is something a little like a dam, and the flies are attracted to heat -- it's a boiling, volatile chemical substance, bugs -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
In the night, they're covered with pollen, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hair we see up there is gone so that the little worms with pollen can escape -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one's my favorite.
It's spring velvet green velvet.
Those who came from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's wild to have about a foot long.
And it has, as far as I know, a capacity that no other plant has, and when it blooms -- this is the boar in the middle -- for about two days, it produces a degree of metabolic change, some of which is similar to that of mammals.
And there's no starch, it's plant food, it's very brown fat stuff that burns at the speed of the fat, and it's metabolic, and it's going at the speed of a kitten.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of the hummingbird -- absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Fahrenheit, two days, but it will keep the temperature constant.
One of these is a temperature-regulating mechanism used to keep the temperature constant.
Why are you doing this? I heard you asking.
Now you don't know that some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They drill in, they're covered in pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them leave and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing to do.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think, very well see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, the birds and us, we see red, green and blue, see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and UV, and they see all kinds of dark UV.
There's some color behind this.
"If we can see those colors aren't good," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lilies, half a day, in Dosset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the place.
It looks like this in the visible light.
If the red would look like that.
Most bees don't feel red.
And then I put an UV filter in front of my camera, and at a certain UV frequency, I was exposed for a long time, and I got this picture.
It's like a real amazing target.
Now we don't know what the bees actually see, when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on here, whether it's insects, or in the minds of other humans.
But the contrast seems to be so, from the background.
This is another small flower -- in different UV frequency zones, different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like that.
In order to avoid you thinking that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- there's no damage to the flowers during the shoot; just stick it on the tripod, not take it off -- under the ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can be the basis of sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Therefore, chemical substances may be of some use.
And finally, it's the smell of a night that was sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway -- an amazing hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
And I think it's poetic, and these pictures are taken with ultraviolet filters, the main use of which is astronomers to film Venus -- actually, the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and procreation, which is the word of flowers.
And just as the flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract pollinators to their invitations, and somehow, they have managed to convince us that there's so much in them that when we're born and when we die, we send flowers to each other, especially at weddings, when you think about it, at this moment, the genetic material moves from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, Chungqing, a journalist, Liu Xian, released a message from the Chongqing City Development and Reform Committee on 26 July, according to which 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen, had been retired from the city to date.
The 53-year-old Li Dynasty, in an interview with a Chinese news reporter, said that his grandfather was fishing in the Dragon Creek, and he had been fishing with his father since the age of 11, shaking small boats, walking along the Dragon Creek, going up to Chongqing Ping, and down to Longevity, leaving home for 10 and a half days each time to support his family.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population has gradually moved towards the towns, the population of the towns has grown and environmental pollution has increased.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms have been built along the Dragon Creek River, which also pollutes river water.
By 2007 and 2008, the River Dragon Creek was turned into a stench.
"The catches of the scales are black, and the cuts are black."
Li Dynasty said it was becoming more and more difficult to fish after the water was polluted.
Local efforts have begun to combat the pollution of dragon streams, including drifting, river cruises, water resource management, etc.
Li also moved from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol to protect aquatic resources.
With effect from 1 January 2020, a complete ban on fishing has been in place in the Aquatic Biological Reserve of Chongqing City, as well as in the associated waters of the main city.
According to data from the Chongqing Municipal Development Reform Commission, as of now, the city of Chongqing has a cumulative total of 34.03 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have entered into catch-back agreements, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the total three-year task, respectively.
A total of 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen, have been re-arrested.
Of the 4404 persons who returned, 4267 were employed, representing 96.89 per cent of those who retired.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the retired fishermen.
As a next step, the city of Chongqing will carry out intensive and specialized clean-up operations, speed up the clean-up and rehabilitation of the Yangtze River River Water Line, complete a new survey of river-to-river sewers and conduct corresponding remediation operations, complete the rehabilitation of “triphosphorous” (for phosphorous mines, phosphorists and phosphorus quarries) and the clean-up of mini-hydropower, promote the reforestation of both banks of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the illegal marinas of the Yangtze River River Current and the illegal harvesting of sand and sand, and further promote the prevention and capture of retreats in the Yangtze River Basin.
Increased Israeli surveillance of repeated outbreaks of disease - new and emerging networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Light Daily, by Wang Si-seok, Responsible Editor, Wang Si-seok
Increased Israeli prevention and control of recurrent outbreaks of disease
Early in the outbreak of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, Israel's anti-control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on anti-control measures and the recent marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia cases in Israel, the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures on a number of occasions to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed in Israel itself, prompting the closure of all ports of entry and exit, the suspension of non-essential trades, the conversion of schools to online instruction, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of municipalities with severe epidemics, and joint military and police defence and control initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, with new cases of coronary pneumonia confirmed in Israel falling to a single digit by mid-May.
As the epidemic was brought under control, Israel ' s anti-control measures were completely lifted, and since June the number of new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
The spread of the epidemic is accelerating, especially after July.
In recent days, more than 1,500 new cases have been reported daily in Israel for eight days, with 916 new cases as at 25 July.
As at 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid resurgence of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after more than 30,000 confirmed cases, the Government of Israel closed public entertainment facilities, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport by requiring a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On 17 September, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the “enclosed city” on weekends, which provided for the implementation of the “enclosed city” between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m., on Fridays a week.
During this period, the population may go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. will remain open.
At the same time, over 10 assemblies are prohibited on all dates and periods, gymnasiums, studios, etc. are closed, canteens are prohibited in restaurants and cafés, and take-out services are permitted only.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and has not been able to join forces with the Government in the fight against it.
In the wake of repeated Israeli epidemics, many people went to the streets to protest against the impact of the Government's preventive measures on their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
In the evening of 21, thousands of more protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem, protesting against the imposition by Prime Minister Netanyahu of preventive measures, such as the ban on restaurants, cafés and canteens, without commensurate compensation.
In addition, in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing the mask, many people are not complying with the requirements of wearing masks and maintaining a two-metre safe social distance in their outdoor activities. Many people wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, schools were the worst affected by the spread of the new coronary virus, and a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists found that kindergarten teachers and students were not wearing masks as required by the Government, nor were they able to maintain a two-metre safe social distance from each other, burying a large number of teachers and students with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory mission to counter the epidemic, argued that Israel was moving towards a “dangerous situation”, noting that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic were insufficient and that all recreational and recreational places and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that Parliament and government departments should move away from their respective interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, with clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
The newspaper Tel Aviv, on the 25th of July, is a reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Xing.
The farmers of Ningxia Siuhara, Wu Feng Fong, were no more than their old companion, Tianfu, and two people were in a car, from their homes 20 miles away, to the Liang Yun cultural compound.
Despite these two years of inconsequential legs, the 77-year-old Dai Tinfu looks forward to “a detour and detour” in the middle of the year.
This is an invisible yard in the former part of the town, where, unlike the general farmyard, the Qin cavity is often heard, as well as a variety of films, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, browsing theatres, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the building of a cultural compound, as he loved the shadow and the opera.
With the cultural compound of Liang Yun, the cultural life of the villagers has been enriched.
The journalist has not yet entered the Liang Yun cultural compound, and the tune of the Qin cavity has been spread.
The Qin cavity band is being played for the villagers and is being played by the villagers of the neighbouring village, Qin Li Xiang.
She has been in love with the Qin accent since childhood and is now well known on the ground, and as long as she has had free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Priscilla played live on the Internet.
"It's a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see their own performances."
On the stage, the singers, one at a glance, the musicians, one at a tone, but with no loss of enthusiasm, despite being amateurs.
Like the pristine style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the “root” art and the non-relict culture of the Qin cultural compound came to the surface.
The compound also contains over 300 items of agricultural tools, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper clipping, embroidery, leather shadow, etc., from different ages.
Leung Yun led journalists into the courtyard displaying his collection of old objects, old kettles, trichords, swirling cars, etc.
Why would a common farmer build a cultural compound?
"Skin movies are my family art, and I've studied it since I was 15 years old."
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural “Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum” in Ningxia and as a model compound for the protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage in sequestered cities.
In addition to the Liang Yun cultural compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the former canton of the sequestered city, including over 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiang River cultural compound, the Wang Yonghong cultural compound, the Yangro cultural compound, etc., covering the towns and streets of the former district, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life grows better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind.”

On July 16th, the 40-monster war show Winner will land on the Beijing Watch.
The Winning was adapted from real history and drawn from the Soviet military archives, which had been in the dust for many years and had been in existence for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to his audience for the “fiction of war plays”, broke the image of the play and challenged a popular “stutter agent”.
In recent years, the proliferation of dramas such as " Mask " , " kite " , and so on, has proved the vitality of quizzes.
Unlike previous quirks, Winning looks at the world and extends the story beyond its background to the Soviet battlefields of the Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 Japanese War, it tells the story of Tang Fei, a Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence worker (Liu Yunlong), who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Committee for Lin River Province and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the “Mudanura” plot of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In a number of charades, the male lead, as a high-level spy, appeared to be a handsome, high-intellectual, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not fit to spy, “The spy is the kind of man who can't find anything in the crowd, and if he's out there, he's the kind of person who looks so handsome, that everyone can't look at you, he can't hide.” There's a line in the kite, “If you don't come after me, I forget that I'm a nationalist,” and the spy's going to be elitist.
So, in Winning, Liu Yunlong was determined to design his star, Tang Fei, as a “stutter agent” with a sense of joy.
The other side of " Winning " was supported by the co-director of the police department Fukuhara, the Japanese, and Li Li, the cynic.
One north and one south, two powerful theatre bones, added many of the best points of view to the entire play.
Directed by the word "joke" to describe Li Li Li's and Liu Yunlong's rival scenes in the play, "It's absolutely a tremor, they're both particularly entangled, and it's very powerful for me. They're often `tangled up', for example, when we write half a page of paper, and if I don't stop filming, they'll be able to do it all the time."
It is not only from the point of view of the characters, but also from the point of view of the audience that the role can be shaped, but also from the point of view of the audience, when the actors are in the role and their character.
In the play, there are also familiar faces in many of Willow's charades, as well as three in Victory, the famous kite, the famous Mountain F4.
He played Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jane's Ho-Jin and Liu Nam-Yang, and this time he played Tang Fei's right arm.
Directed by Infei, the director said, "These two people have no base, and they just follow the waves in that time, in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We need to be human. This is the feeling that people around me must be good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also develop them, and our teams will grow."
The end of the play for both of them was also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.

Four students of the Inner Mongolia flag were drowned.
On the evening of 26 July, a caller (Journal Lee Aiping) from China's new network, Hulenbel, the journalist learned of the tragic death of four local students by drowning, from the government of the Horonbel city of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Public Security Bureau of the flag State of Aryong was informed of the drowning of six lower secondary school students in the area.
Upon receipt of the police, the local civilian police first arrived at the scene, rescued two students on-the-spot, and then the local emergency and water authorities, among others, arrived at the site and took part in the rescue.
It was reported that more than 80 members of the Public Security Civil Police, the San Police, the Fire and Medical Services had been deployed at the rescue site, and that three rubber boats had been sent to continue to salvage the surrounding waters, and that specialized rescue teams had been hired to arrive at the site to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The reporter learned that the first student was found by local relief workers on 25 July at 0640 hours, the second student was found on 25 July at 11.30 p.m., the third student was found on 25 July at 12.40 p.m., the last student was found on 25 July at 1334 p.m. The four men were found to have gone ashore without vital signs as determined by the local 120 first aid centre.
Officially, the drowning was a wake-up call to society as a whole.
At present, the relevant local government departments are compiling some knowledge on the prevention of drowning, in the hope that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua Society Hong Kong on 25 July, the Director of the Financial and Economic Affairs and Treasury Department of the HKSAR Government, Xu Jung-woo, stated that the financial market in Hong Kong remained active and well-functioning.
He was optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
At an online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Congress Chamber of Commerce (Congregation Canada) on 24 (Toronto time), he said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation as a result of the “repair of windwaves” and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and biased towards the guaranteed level of exchange by the strong.
The banking system showed no clear signs of financial outflows; on the contrary, over $11 billion had been inflow since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, which have been on the rise.
Jung-woo said that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic had put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong ' s fundamental advantages remained unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple low-tax system, which keeps Hong Kong at the forefront of international financial centres.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$ 6 billion from the Immunization Fund to create some 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering persons with different skills and qualifications.
In order to support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the “One Thousand People's Scheme” to finance local financial science and technology companies, start-ups and other businesses with financial science and technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's pool of financial science and technology talent.
Looking ahead, Jung-woo Xu is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to use the advantages of Hong Kong and its status as an international financial centre, an international centre for asset and wealth management and a global offshore renminbi business hub for development and investment in and around the Australasia Bay region of Hong Kong.
The Lancet published praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences.
According to the Journal 25 of The Lancet, China, a country with 1.4 billion people of similar size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, without further widespread transmission, to a large extent controlling the epidemic in the country.
According to the article, over the past 10 years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, making it much more prepared for the new crown than for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of that year.
The author states that, at the time of the 2002 SARS outbreak, China was initially ill-prepared and, in particular, the pathogens could not be identified.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and, on 11 January 2020, the genome sequencing data were shared with the international community.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had articulated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronary virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research and, in the event of a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, conducted very rapidly and strictly, with the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China announced in May and July, respectively, in the Lancet.
China ' s experience had shown that it was important to invest in national health and research systems and to improve laboratory capacity effectively.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, in particular low- and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of learning and learning.
Moreover, China ' s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, a strong, high-level and decisive scientific basis for sound decision-making is necessary to bring the new crown epidemic under effective control.
The article stressed the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most socially beneficial manner.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's National Guard appointed three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronary virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of the Wuhan “Claude City” on 23 January. When experts raised the need and urgency of building the quadrant hospital, the Government took the decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, broad community and popular participation enabled the epidemic to be brought under control quickly and effectively.
The article concluded by highlighting the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

Former inspector of the Uhai City Council of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, platinum Sea, was expelled from the Party.
According to the Supervisory Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Supervisory Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the approval of the Party Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, conducted a case review of the serious breaches of discipline in the platinum Sea by the former Commissioner of the City Council of Inner Mongolia.

In the afternoon of 25 local time, a small aircraft crashed into the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wessel County, Northern Germany, resulting in three deaths.
A joint statement issued the same evening by the Duisburg prosecution, the Wessel County Police and the Fire Department of the City of Wesser stated that at about 1440 hours on the same day, a small aircraft crashed into a multi-story residential loft on the Penitentiary of Pfirskamp Street in Wessel County, killing three people.
It took off on the same day from the city of Mar, Ruer District, Northern Wei County, and then took off again after a stopover at the airport in Wessel County, and then hit the residential building.
The deceased person was identified or was a female household in the house hit and two passengers on a small aircraft.
A two-year-old child was only slightly injured in the room and was safely rescued.
The rest of the house was not injured in the accident, but the mood remained unsettled.
On-site footage reported by the German News Agency (DZN) showed that, at one point, the homes that had been hit by the accident had been smoked and that firefighters had put out the fire, and that there had been serious damage to the houses.
At present, the cause of the crash is not clear.
The Rhine Post quoted police reports that there were clues indicating that the plane had broken up before it hit the residential building.
According to the police, several parts of the crash aircraft were found in the area of the accident.
The German criminal police, together with the Duisburg prosecution, the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, are investigating the causes of the accident.
On the same day, the journalist learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf that it had contacted the local police station and the fire department and that, according to the judgement of the scene, none of the casualties had been Chinese citizens.
The Singapore Ministry of Health announced on 26th day that, as of 1200 hours on that day, there were 481 new confirmed cases in Singapore, with a cumulative 50369 confirmed cases and 27 cumulative deaths.
The data show that of the new confirmed cases, five were local community cases, four were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.
Singapore ' s Ministry of Health stated that 98 per cent of the new confirmed cases were related to known infections.
There are still 173 new coronary patients in hospital, most of them stable or improved, and no one is in intensive care.
In addition, 4,648 people are segregated in community facilities.
The majority of the newly infected population in Singapore are foreign workers.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 dormitories dedicated to foreign workers in Singapore, as well as some 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Inter-Sectoral Working Group on Disease Control has recently indicated that the Singapore Government is stepping up the testing of the last few dormitories dedicated to foreign workers with high rates of new crown infection.
Upon completion of the testing of all special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo a new crown test on a regular basis.
Da Ping's director, Xinhua Network, is in the Golden Lord's Award.
On 18 July, at the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival, the official list of selected films for the Golden Prize was published.
Da Ping's first real-life film, " Good for Good " , was successfully included in the film festival's Golden Prize, and the film's first poster was officially released.
Posters, table charts.
The film " Happily " was the first real-world work by Da Peng ' s director and a second-degree connection with the Golden Lord ' s Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who came back to his hometown in the north-eastern countryside with an unexpected vision of how a family could be made into a literary film in the course of the year, with the result of a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for the film completed the final party.
In today’s film poster, one of the members of the family, Wang Xiang Xiang, sits in the center of the picture and smokes in the background of the black land of the northeast, in silver, with the prospect of a red light cage that Chinese people must hang for their holidays.
The contrast between the happy, reunified red lamps and the mirage of kings seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this extended family relationship.
According to the information received, apart from the fact that the daughter of Wang Xiang Xiang was played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the film was performed by the real director's family, the experimental audio-visual style of the film broke the boundaries between the theatre and the real, and brought a new immersion experience to the audience.
According to the director Da Peng, the creation of "The Good One" originated from a series of sudden changes in the family during the shoot, which forced the original project to change, and life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but released the power beyond design.
How does the director, Da Peng, deal with this "behavior" and how can he continue to face the changes brought about by it?
There is no doubt that Happiness is an experimental, almost ubiquitous, audio-visual style that transforms life in front of the camera into a film, and that, in a package of real images, the audience will also find its own and its family's shadow from the family that the film presents, and a series of reflections will follow with the end of this family gathering.

Ten degrees below the average temperature of the year, a row of simple barracks standing at the entrance of the mountain, with a flag swarming not far away, soldiers on duty daily in the wind, and regular patrols to higher-altitude locations.
The fighters climbed the steep slopes of the rocks and needed both hands and feet.
At the end of July, at a time when low-altitude areas were full of grass, only the relatively dense greenness of the ravine behind the barracks was found in Baldrukang.
The soldiers at the post, who had been stationed for six years, said that this was their backyard, and that only in July and August of each year could we see the grass slowly growing and, shortly thereafter, all turned yellow and covered by snow.
A foot patrol could take about nine hours.
In the harsh highland environment, the soldiers who are stationed here are often accompanied by snow and glaciers, and they are also required to make regular patrols to the higher ends of the mountain.
Today, a patrol of eight soldiers, led by mentor Yo-Hin Liang, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs around 30 pounds, heading towards the target early in the morning.
On the way, one of the fighters was renegade, and the comrades were urgently rescued.
In addition to the patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Batukon outpost conducted daily tactical and physical training.
The passage of time, the rising altitude, the decreasing oxygen content and the constant overstretching of strength tested the will of the patrol personnel.
They gnawed their teeth, and crossed several landslide points, as well as several flashpoints.
At 1600 hours, during lunch hours, the patrol crews brought their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5700 metres above sea level, accompanied by rain and snow, and supplemented their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Baldrukang post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they play cards together, losers do push-ups, entertain and exercise.
After a brief break from the cold wind, they climbed up to the target point of the patrol and took the flag out at the mountain entrance, solemnly swearing.
Behind them is Mount Marmash, which lies dozens of kilometres of uninhabited land, the safest guardian of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumption Season Restart - Xinhua Network
The Beijing City relaunched its consumer season activities in accordance with the principle of “a comprehensive renewal, focused, well-structured, well-organized and well-organized”.
On 26 July, 1.5 million government coupons were issued, including 1 million off-line food coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers could receive from APP in Tokyo.
The Deputy Director-General of the Beijing City Business Bureau, Liu Mei-in, at a media conference held in Beijing, described the re-opening of the consumer season as a further reduction in business matching, based on the maintenance of the existing bond card package preferential subsidy.
Starting in early August, the current 1:1 government and enterprise portfolio was adjusted to 2:1, for example, once consumers received a card package to the shop, they were granted a 120-dollar discount, of which the Government subsidized $60, the business concession $60, the government subsidy $80, and the business concession $40.
During the consumption season, three major operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new capital and 5G new consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mau Bo, referring to Hong Kong's economy as being hit again by the epidemic, is calling on all sides to share the difficulties - the new Chinese net.
On 26 July, the Director of Finance of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Chen Maobo, said that Hong Kong had been hit by a new wave of neo-crowd pneumonia, as well as by commercial and economic activity, which had seen a slight recovery.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on all large and small owners to reduce their rents and to work with retail traders, food producers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article on the Internet, entitled " The Challenging Road to Recovery " .
He stated that the recent high number of cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosis in Hong Kong and the critical situation had affected the lives of the population and affected the economy.
When the epidemic repeats, the primary priority is to prevent the entry of cases and to process and disrupt the transmission chain of the virus at the highest possible speed; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should be resumed accordingly, in due course.
He noted that, in the face of a new wave of epidemic shocks, commercial exchanges and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
In addition to the contractual spirit, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially those groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he considered that the external situation in Hong Kong remained critical.
According to Chen Maobo, the development history of Hong Kong over the past decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city clouded with fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg is known for its unique and beautiful skyline, but it was almost invisible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was a severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between that beautiful environment, which I've known all my life, and the skyline, which is clouded by the fog, is in my heart.
I'm afraid there's a good chance that the ever-changing sunset view will be swallowed by the dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure that I can't code the problem of atmospheric pollution.
What am I going to do with this?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all keep it in our minds.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may imply a way to solve problems in that area.
Sometimes you have a unique perspective that inspires unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then will you be able to know the results.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research, and I quickly learned that atmospheric pollution is the greatest environmental health risk in the world.
World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution in and around households, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual mortality from atmospheric pollution is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation, or deaths due to malnutrition among children, appear pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, while at the same time causing huge economic costs: according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, spending in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find useful ground and help us make better decisions.
And when I think about the problem of atmospheric pollution, and how to deal with it, and it becomes clear, we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the magnitude of the problem, it's very necessary to work together.
So I decided to go meet some people who work in this field.
I started a conversation with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called people who were completely strangers but involved.
These experiences, which I've been involved in, have helped me to get a deeper understanding of the problem.
And it helped me avoid the trap that people in my line of work sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: before they really know the problem, quickly adopt a technology.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started to ask myself, how effectively the skills of my knowledge in software engineering and artificial intelligence, and the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, make associated predictions to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a realistic solution, but I'm also faced with uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's going to work.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I get from my work. And, of course, for people who have been working in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are new.
I've come to realize that sometimes there's a new perspective, a new skill set, that can give rise to something extraordinary.
Our willpower and imagination is a beacon that tells us to cross the barrier and open a new chapter.
I got a deeper understanding of the problem of atmospheric pollution, looking for data on atmospheric pollution over the past decade or so, as well as for the weather in and around Johannesburg, and then, with my colleagues from South Africa and China, I created the air quality resolution support system and uploaded it to the clouds.
This software can analyse historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine technology to learn a few days in advance to predict future contamination.
That means residents can make better decisions about their daily journey and where their families are settled.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events, define the sources of severe pollution, and allow the authorities to direct them to adjust their operations.
By supporting scenario planning, urban planners can make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure, such as housing in industrial areas.
We've built a pilot of that technology, run for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been validated, and the projections we've shown and the data we've collected in the field show a close correlation.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instrument to predict atmospheric mass, and its resolution and correctness were unprecedented, so that the city I was driving into could benefit from the recent winter morning, when I said to myself, "There's something wrong, and I have to do something."
So the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution in the first place?
What if I don't focus on the state of the country's environment, but rather hope that some place, some other person will be in charge of these things?
What I've learned from this is that it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when we're all committed to a cause that we all believe in.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So wherever you are in the world, next time, when you find out that some kind of innate curiosity of yours is raised, and it's about what you mean, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why don't you try it?
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem, do your best, in your own way?
You might get the surprise.
Thank you.

The biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern sea this year - the new Chinese net.
On July 26, in Taipei, China's news agency, at 2052 hours in the eastern waters of Taiwan, there was an earthquake of the size of the Richter scale, with a maximum seismic level of four, with a full-scale shock, the largest earthquake in the country this year.
The Taiwan Meteorological Department reports that the earthquake struck 86.5 km south-east of the Illan County Government, i.e., the eastern sea of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 km.
China's seismological network measured the earthquake to 5.5 degrees.
The biggest shocks across the entire region are: level 4 in Hua Lian County, level 3 in Ilaan County, Taidong County, Nanzhou County, Yunlin County, and levels 1 to 2 in other counties and municipalities.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake, the largest in the world since the beginning of this year, is a hidden-band earthquake, which is the boundary of the plate, and in which earthquakes have occurred in the past and have been active since the beginning of this year.
In the coming week, the presence of aftershocks of a magnitude above level 4 will not be excluded.
A lot of people think driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car alone and safely, and until now, it's considered an impossible task.
Hi, my name is Dennis Hong, and we made a car for the freedom and independence of the blind for people with visual impairments.
Before I tell you about this car for the blind, let me say a few words about another project that I've done, called the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Program City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button, you don't touch anything, and it's completely automatic to its destination.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won half a million dollars to get third in the race.
About that time, the National Association of the Blind, or the Blind Society, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try, because we thought, "Hey, where's this gonna be?"
We've got an automatic car.
All we have to do is get the blind to drive inside. That's it, isn't it?
But we're wrong.
What the Association wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that blind people can choose and control.
So we had to give up all of our old things from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them a second chance to ride around with this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it can only be designed to drive blind people in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a small road made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step, to make a real car that could travel on the real road.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have the induction phase, the computational phase and the non-visual interface.
The driver was obviously invisible, so the system had to be able to sense the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
Here, we use the initial measurement element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like an ear, inner ear.
I put this information and GPS together to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangers.
Laser scans the environment to detect the barrier -- the front, the rear by the vehicle, along with any obstacle that enters the road, any barrier around the vehicle.
All the big information then aggregates into the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment -- which is the path of the car, which is the barrier -- and to convert that information to the driver.
And the system is also very intelligent enough to figure out the safest path to a car.
We can also give instructions on how to run a vehicle.
But the question is, how can we transmit information and instructions fast enough and accurate enough to the blind to make sure he can drive?
And for that, we designed a lot of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The initial three-dimensional flat system, vibrating vests, acoustic gears, leg belts, even shoe pressurizing feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driver handle.
And this is a pair of gloves, and at the point of the finger, it has a vibrating component, so you can transmit the instructions -- direction and range.
Another device is called the velocity stun.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we reassemble the vibrations of different modes, we let them transmit the information on speed, and we also have instructions on how to use the throttles and brakes.
Here, you can see how computers understand the surroundings, because you can't see the vibrations, and we actually installed red luminous diodes on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensor data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driver's handle and the speed band, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are command hint devices.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
Computers tell you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call it copilot.
So we're avoiding command hint devices, and we're focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Look at this as a monitor for the blind.
It's a small desktop, with a lot of holes on it, where compressed air is removed, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can sense the path and the barrier.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of releases in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multidimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left, on the right, and how the computer interprets and transmits this information to the blank.
So, we're showing a simulation program, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't go unless it's proven to be as safe to drive as today's car, or safer.
I really believe this is going to happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How are we going to deal with insurance?
How are we going to issue a driver's license?
There are many different kinds of obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by a blind person.
But what is potentially more important than that is the huge value inherent in the by-products of this project.
The sensors that can be used to see through the darkness, the rain fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer for visible people.
Or for the blind, home-based devices of daily life -- educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine, in class, teachers write notes on blackboards, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
It's extremely precious.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Marinichev said that the change in value was influenced by the devaluation of the rubles and the epidemic.
He said, “The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet.”
Malinichev did not rule out a significant annual increase in Internet prices, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset the dissatisfaction with price increases.
"The Chinese Doctor" is a tribute to Xinhua Network, an anti-epidemic hero.
In recent days, with the respect of Chinese filmmen in the fight against the hero of the disease, the director of the Bona Film Group, Liu Weiqiang (Tutt), who is the director of the film group, held a talk in Guangzhou with a member of the courtyard of Chongnan, on the production of the anti-epidemic film " Chinese Doctors " .
The Bona Film industry wishes to pay tribute to the Chinese Doctors for all the medical and vaccination workers who fought on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be presented as a national film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, the Bona Film industry is being deployed under the arrangements of the Chinese Ministry and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Bureau and the Hubei Province Film Bureau, to organize a film entitled " Chinese Doctors " , prepared by the original team of the film " China Captain " , a film that reflects the strong leadership of the Party and the unity of the people of the country in the fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan's anti-epidemic front, using the background of Wuhan healers and provincial and city rescue teams, unique narratives, as well as a powerful lens language, from a human point of view, and presents a moving story of Chinese healers with dedication and sacrifice on the front line of the anti-epidemic.
It is known that in the first days of the day when Wuhan was released, Bona was able to overcome all the difficulties by sending a filming team deep into the epidemic, exchanging information and gathering information with hundreds of health-care workers face-to-face, and that a large number of precious first-hand video materials have been taken by white angels on the frontlines of the anti-epidemic front, including the Choon Namsan Monastery, Guangzhou First Mangang, Guangdong-Oo Medical Corps, and the Wuhan Jingu Hospital, Wu Han-San and Hospital, Wuhan University Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital.
During the symposium, Master Chung Nansan also raised expectations and hopes for film production: “I look forward to seeing not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical workers who are the majority.”
He stated that he had previously read " Me and My Fatherland " , " China ' s Captain " , and believed that it would be good to tell the story of the big picture from a common man ' s perspective.
“Some foreign friends still have misunderstandings about China.”
Referring to the distribution of the film, Master Chung Nansan said that some outside the country now prefer to put the virus on a politicized label, and he hoped that the film would impress the audience from a human point of view: “This film, in addition to being shown in China, should also be shown abroad, in a way that is understandable to both domestic and international audiences, with a true human spirit.”
Mr. Chung Nansan also recalled the film Man to Middle Ages of the 1980s, “So many years have passed, and I was most impressed with the post-reform movie, Man to Middle Ages, when my doctors and friends abroad cried, and it would be amazing if the Chinese Doctor could do so.”
Mr. Chung Nanshan said that it would have been very successful if the Chinese Doctor had been resonant with foreign audiences.
During the conversation, Mr. Chung Nansan also shared his opinion and recommendations on the current international epidemic, “I believe that people are always smarter than the virus.”
According to Master Chung, although the virus is difficult to predict, humans have survived so far in the primitive world, where modern societies have developed medical technologies and social management measures, coupled with a basic understanding of science in the face of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, among medical personnel and even among ordinary people around the world, so that people are no longer as passive as they used to be, “the next step is to look at two areas of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to focus on healing people's minds.”

"Hunanan Daily News" - the first Red Book meeting - today's news.
The Hunan Daily News, a client reporter for the new Hunan, Jiang Siun, a correspondent, Shaw Yin.
On July 25, the Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival of 2020 was inaugurated in the mountains.
As one of the main events, the first Red Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory Centre in Sasayama.
The exhibition area is full of red and original literature products, the revolutionary old area earth products, and so forth, which attracts tourists from all over the country to compete for their purchase.
“The Red Games are both a demonstration of the achievements of the red cultural industry throughout the country and an important platform for the sharing of experiences and the exploration of development paths among exhibitors and enterprises.”
The head of the Executive Committee of the first Red Games, introduced by the President, said that the Games, which were devoted to the theme of promoting the warming of the red culture, had a total area of nearly 3,000 square metres, with the creation of an atmosphere-building area, an exhibition area, and a network of Red Man and Red Man.
A total of 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses, red original products, etc., were invited to the exhibition of 137 enterprises and units in eight out-of-country municipalities, including Zhejiang Ka-hing, Guizhou compliance, Xi-Yanan, and my Governor, Sha, Chang, Yang, Qing.
The exhibition area will be on display until 29 July.
As the host of the Red Ribbon, the exhibition area is full of bright spots.
The director of the exhibition area described the division between the red industry and the development of the red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Fair displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Wallithlite, Wallithine cable and thorium power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Fair displays nearly 200 copies of 27 individual products, including the Red Book series, the Red Food series, and the Red Book creation products.
In the Yan'an area, a number of tourists were attracted to displays of flower handicrafts and paper-cutting works of art.
The exhibition, which was presented by the Director of the Yenan City Department of Culture and Tourism, Madong Po, carefully selected the excellent red original products of Yanan over the past two years, 16 of which were excellent works of the 2019 national red original.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project “Anse Scissors”, the Song of the North, and the provincial non-residual project, the Yanchuan Bus, to promote the Yanan Folklore special products, and to take this opportunity to interact with other exhibitors and promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of newly diagnosed cases in Japan is over 30,000 - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on 26 days, and more than 200 new cases per day for six days, bringing the total to 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were reported in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka and 80 in Aichi.
Telecommunication network fraud increased by 70% in the first half of the year.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service prosecuted a total of 58101 persons for fraud, a 35 per cent increase over the previous year.
In particular, the number of fraud-related offences is high, and the number of fraud-related offences prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of fraud-related offences.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been published in 10 typical cases related to the prevention and control of the epidemic.
In the first half of the year, the prosecution's case was characterized by a high profile of fraud-related crimes, up to the country's macro-policies, down to civilian food and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical-care” fraud, “health-care” fraud, “job-seeking” fraud, “routing” fraud, State-subsidized fraud, national asset unfrozen fraud, etc., and continued to be “new” in the areas of education, health, employment, old age, social security, land evictions, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit, etc., causing not only economic damage to the victims, but also serious economic and social development.
In particular, a number of telecommunications network frauds break across borders, geographical and human constraints, with popular, cross-border, remote and electronic payment features, with no specific groups of victims and significant harm.
For example, it is more confusing to set up specialized companies, rent high-end writing buildings, create multiple departments or posts, use legitimate web platforms to promote, recruit, train and test recruiters, manage business models, and wear “legitimate coats”.
It is incumbent upon the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to give prompt warning to the public and the relevant authorities.
In the case of the judiciary, the Public Prosecution Service takes seriously its responsibilities by maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud and by fine-tuning law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance, including through the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office has strictly restricted the factual, evidentiary, procedural and legal application of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases to the facts and to the law.
In particular, in the case of telecommunication network fraud, the focus was on the central role of electronic data in fact-finding, and efforts were made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of disease-related fraud handled by the Ningbo District Prosecutor ' s Office in Zhejiang province, the prosecution service intervened early in the first instance, from the time of the incident to the conclusion of the case, and took only five days, reflecting its attitude and determination to move quickly and to maintain stability in society.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focusing on the prosecution of the cases, correcting the failure of the public security organs to catch 733 persons and correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 co-perpetrators.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in response to the shortcomings identified in the management of the telecommunications network by communications enterprises, banks, intermediaries, etc., the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor ' s Office of Guangdong Province and the Dongjung Municipal Prosecutor ' s Office issued timely inspection recommendations, urging the units concerned to strengthen their supervision and improve their mechanisms in order to contribute to the development of a system of efficiency.
The fourth is to do everything in its power to recover the damage.
The local procuratorial authorities have seized on important points of involvement in the investigation, leading the evidence and examining the prosecution, and have urged the investigating authorities to actively pursue the recovery of the proceeds, to cooperate with the relevant authorities in their efforts to minimize the economic damage inflicted on the population as a result of the crime of fraud.
For example, in the case of a set of loans in Lin, a case involving 22 housing units awaiting seizure, the first of which was the issuance of a stay of execution letter in the event that the property could be pre-empted in other cases, was brought before the relevant court in a timely manner, and it was recommended that the previous seizure court should suspend the property in question, and that it should be dealt with in a unified manner once the facts of the crime had been established, and that maximum efforts should be made to recover the property in question and to recover the damage suffered by the victims.
The Prosecutor reminds that there is a high level of vigilance with regard to fraud, and that there is no expectation of a “poetry falling out of the sky” or of a “money bag” that would be cheap and unconvinced.
Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple trees, wide out of poverty - Middle New Net.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network.
Inflammation of the summer, the daily Economic Journal-China Economic Network journalist walked into the town of China Hai village, Wining County, Guizhou Province.
In the face of the sun, the villagers, Li Yuanzhong, groved grass in the base and, despite the redness of his face, humed a few hymns from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, is not able to sell a good price because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large day and night temperatures, high sugar and good taste, and has a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but because of its small size and its large number of spots, it has not been able to make a good price and form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poor town with a “basket of rice” and a high incidence of local poverty of 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty into a decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional cultivation practices, restructure the industry and increase the incomes of farmers.
After a number of visits, Chen Tai and a group of people from the town considered that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town of Jinan has introduced a flagship enterprise to grow apples in a modern way.
The Deputy General Manager of Winning Beyond Agriculture Ltd., Hu Jianwen, in 2015, came to the town of Tsangxi to study the local conditions of cultivation, starting in 2016 with the local planting of apple trees.
At first, when the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant an apple tree, the couple murmured: "For so many years, no one in the village planted an apple to make a fortune."
"All the apples grown are dwarfed apples, not so tall as an apple tree."
What happened to Lee Won-chung was that the new way of planting the apples was that the irrigation pipes were laid under every apple tree, the water and fertilizer were poured on the roots, and when the harvests took place in the autumn, the tractors drove directly into the orchards and were standing to pick the fruit.
At present, the Apple Base is gradually entering productive life, and the market, as Hu Jianwen had anticipated, is not so sad as to sell apples, which are very popular with urban consumers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought about a new change in Li's life and, while still growing, a new source of income.
Nine acres of land flow from the Li Yuanzheng family to the Apple Base, and each year, in addition to the land transfer fee on the bottom, there is a profit bonus after the hanging fruit, and the couple usually work in the base, “one person gets $80 a day, and every year they work”.
Mr. Li told the press that the profit mark of last year was more than 2,800, plus the land transfer fee and the husband's and wife's wages, and that the family's income was more than 80,000.
"Acre apples produce more than 15,000 yuan per year, about 10 times the value of maize grown."
Chen said to the press that the entire town of Xuan has now planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in the village of China alone, covering 4056 families and 17.2 million people, including 656 families and 2952 poor families, with a salary of more than $6 million a year, and that the base has been built in front of its home, so that it does not have to go out to work.
The increasingly bulge of the waist, Li Yuan Trung, has also begun to realize his own wish.
On the spring of this year, Li wonzheng bought a Land Cruiser, as he drove off from work today, “the family has more than a dozen acres of land, and when the next apple base expands, the flow goes to them, and the income is even greater”.

The membrane separation technology helps crack the "temperature effect" - the new mesh.
The membrane separation technology contributes to the cracking of the “temperature effect”
A map of the new mix of matrix-based membrane preparation techniques
Reporter Swe reported that the atmosphere environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University had recently made significant progress in the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the “membrane separation method”, with the successful development of new hybrid membrane preparation techniques and significant enhancement of the carbon dioxide capture performance of the membrane material.
The results were published as a cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
“The greenhouse effect” is a major environmental problem afflicting human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of the “greenhouse effect”.
The efficient capture and utilization of human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists ' attention.
“Membrane separation” is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials and is efficient, energy-efficient and operationally simple.
How to “breath deep breaths” of membrane material and increase the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific team at Tianjin University innovatively explored the effects of different solvents on the separability of membrane gases through repeated experiments.
The results of the experiment showed that the production of membrane materials using N-methyl ketamine as a pre-positioned solvent resulted in a more even distribution of carbon nanotubes and a “breathing out” of the membrane materials, which effectively increased the efficiency and rate of gas separation of the membrane materials.
With this new technology, mixed matrix membrane, CO2 separability is close to the current theoretical separation cap for this type of membrane material.
“New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation techniques to capture carbon dioxide.”
Li Yun, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University, stated: “We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the handling of flue gas and will play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, among other areas.”
Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what a professional is-- a new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning newspaper
Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what a professional is.
Every year, students or parents report to the NCC, thereby affecting the voluntary filing, as they are not aware of the terminology involved in the voluntary filing.
This year, the Beijing Transport University, the Beijing University of Science and Technology, the Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, the Beijing Forestry University, the Beijing Chemical University and five higher schools jointly launched a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What is the significance of poor professional standards in voluntary filing?
There are three ways of assigning a profession.
Experts cautioned that before volunteering, it was important to have a detailed reading of the Statute of Admission to Heart School, the rules for admission to higher education, including the stratification rate, the rules for professional distribution, etc.
Professional allocation rules refer to the three main forms of professional priority, merit priority and professional differentials for admission to the profession, after a post-secondary grade.
The specific modalities used by higher education institutions will be specified in the Statute of Admissions.
However, there are also some institutions of higher education where the overall priority is given to admission and where there is no hierarchy between the professions.
This means that candidates within the admission range are queued on the basis of the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary entry score line, it depends on whether the second professional voluntary entry score line is reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer, with no difference in rank between the professional volunteers.
The so-called “professional differential” is the value of one or more of the scores published in the admission charters of the institutions when arranging for the candidate's profession, which determines the intake of the candidate for the different specializations, i.e. the “professional gap”.
That is to say, the difference in the scores of the institutions when they enroll candidates for voluntary and non-professional first profession, and the difference in the grades between professional volunteers, e.g., 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Under the assumption that Ming, a student, took a 560-point examination at the A High School, the professional volunteers were: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the admission to the A High School was based on a professional grade differential of two, one, one and zero.
In the case of professional assignments, if the junior professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and has a planned balance of profession, the junior professional is admitted to the “computer” profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by two points, with a 558 score ranking of candidates for the “international trade” examination for the first professional; if it is still not met, the third professional voluntary “automated” entry will be reduced by one point (i.e., 557); if it remains unsatisfied, the next professional will be admitted to the fourth profession by one point (i.e., 556) and the next professional will not be reduced by one point, and so on.
Different university-level differentials.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now eliminated the professional gap, but this method has been retained in some of them this year, with more than 20 universities having established a professional gap, according to the Charter of Admissions published by the respective schools.
For example, the Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Teacher University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Electric University, American University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Technical University, Chinese Institute of Civil Aviation Flight, etc.
In these universities, the professional differentials vary from one university to another.
Some institutions of higher education have a grade difference in each field, as in the case of Ningxia University, where the files have been sent to the candidates, in descending order of one point, according to the order in which the candidates report their professional volunteers.
Some universities, on the other hand, set different levels of specialization between different specializations.
For example, at the University of the United States of America, the total margin for professional volunteer grades is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first-professional volunteers and 3 points for other professional volunteers, no grade differentials between other professional volunteers, which are considered to be parallel volunteers, and 1 point for other professional and transfer professional volunteers.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported schools, see if there are any professional differences, what the form of the grade differential is, and, while taking full account of the scores, make a sound analysis of the schools and professions to be selected, and if the admission rules of the institutions are explicitly based on grade differentials, when selecting the profession, pay attention to the gradient between the specializations and increase the rate of admission.
Chongqing Morning News.
The first Atlantic hurricane this year landed in Texas, where the epidemic hit hard.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States announced in the morning that Hurricane Hanna had reached 145 kilometres per hour and was expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and north-eastern Mexico by Monday, with rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual movement towards land, customs have been weakened and, despite local power outages, no casualty statistics have been reported for the time being.
A number of local officials in Texas are preparing to deal with cyclones that are likely to occur in the coastal zone.
On Twitter, President Trump stated that the Office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on the population to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and to protect families and property.
At the same time, the state of Texas ' s new crown epidemic is rapidly worsening, with a rising number of infections, with a cumulatively more than 390,000 confirmed infections and over 5,000 deaths.
In the wake of this hurricane, the Government will face the twin challenges of sheltering the homeless while preventing a further deterioration of the epidemic.
For the first time, an ad hoc committee was set up, a group signed a “long draft” and a coalition of exhibitors for the third World Expo built the “Breaths” - Xinhua Network.

The Panel will make recommendations for the analysis of sectoral trends to promote sustainable industrial development.
At the same time, the consolidation of industry-wide chain resources, in large and small terms, will lead to the emergence of associated enterprises and will make the Expo a confluence of industry enterprises.
The establishment, for the first time, of the Public Health Commission against Pneumonia was particularly important in the current fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
As Vice-President of the Public Health Commission of the Third Expo, Jianping, General Manager of the Rapid Diagnostic Operations of the Greater Central China District, said that the next step would be to join forces with more industry partners to explore new solutions and cooperation models to help China and the world fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The inauguration of the Specialized Committee on Public Health Prevention was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
It was reported that, for the first time, the Third Expo had established a public health quarantine zone and that, to date, nearly 50 global enterprises had signed up for exhibitions with an area of more than 10,000 square metres.
During the first Expo, in 2018, the Alliance of Expo Participants was established by a voluntary initiative of the exhibitors to serve as a platform for high-quality business exchange and cooperation, a platform for information- and resource-sharing among participants, and a think tank for promoting trade and commerce and development between China and the countries of the world (regions).
To date, 142 enterprises have joined the exhibitors ' alliance, covering 23 countries and regions around the world.
3-year-old Belgian girl died of new coronary virus infection - Xinhuanet
The Belgian health sector stated on 24 that a 3-year-old girl died of a new coronary virus infection, the country ' s youngest new coronary disease.
The Belgian spokesperson for the health sector, Boudwin Caterri, said that the girl had already had other serious diseases before contracting the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died from the new coronary virus.
According to Katri, 85 per cent of the new coronary patients in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He reminds a healthy and younger population not to take it lightly.
“Although it is rare for young people to die of new coronary virus infections, no one is immune now.”
Last week, the number of new coronary confirmed cases in Belgium increased by 89 per cent over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from the new coronary virus, up from 1.7 per day in the previous week.
During the peak of the European epidemic, the Belgian population accounted for “the highest number” of new coronary virus infections in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The most recent data show that, cumulatively, 64,847 people in Belgium are infected with the new coronary virus.
Katri warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowball rolls and eventually results in an avalanche.
In an effort to curb the resurgence of the epidemic, the Prime Minister of Belgium, Sophie Vermes, announced on 23 August that the regulations governing the wearing of masks in public places would be tightened and that the programme for the further lifting of restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

On 25 July, Xinhua, Hong Kong, Xinhua, the Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development of the HKSAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, stated that all APEC member economies should act in concert to combat the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should refrain from creating unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Quintenghua made the above-mentioned statement on the occasion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 25 videoconference of trade ministers to combat the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to respond to the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Quintom said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had unprecedented far-reaching social and economic consequences.
“We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can recover the economy.
We want clear goals, and the virus is our common enemy, and cooperation is the only way to win, and vice versa.”
According to Quintom, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has triggered a series of trade restrictions that help to contain the epidemic.
Trade was the key solution to the current problems and should not be seen as a problem.
He condemned all policy measures that were discriminatory and fragmented, and urged all economies to remain open at this critical time, maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and avoid trade barriers or irrational trade policies.
Four hundred and forty-four thousand new crown cases have been diagnosed in the State of the Middle East, the second most affected country in the United States of America.
Sino-News, 26 July, a comprehensive report, shows on the website of Johns Hopkins University in the United States that, as of around 8.34 p.m. Beijing time, the state of Florida in the United States had reported more than 414,000 newly diagnosed cases, more than 411,000 in New York, the second largest “problem” in the United States since California.
According to the Florida Health Service on 25, 124 deaths were reported in Florida on 24th.
This is the tenth death toll of more than 100 people a day in Florida since the beginning of the new crown pandemic.
According to the information received, the total number of cases in Ded County, Miami, the most affected county in Florida, has exceeded 100,000.
There are currently 8,974 new coronary admissions in Florida, of which 1874 are in Miami Deed.
Since 4 July, the number of new coronary hospitalizations in the state has increased by 79 per cent.
Since the reopening of the first state of the United States on 24 April, 91,000 lives have been lost to the new crown.
According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University, the total number of confirmed consultations reported in the United States has reached 4,176,000, with at least 146,000 deaths.
The people of Chengdu came together and watched the consulate, and the police stopped people from "seeming too happy."
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu this Friday.
On Saturday, the emblem of the United States Consulate was withdrawn, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the Consulate in the noise of passers-by.
On Sunday, a large number of Chengdu people piled up in front of the United States Consulate to take photographs, and people who had never been here came to see them, driven by curiosity.
Agence France-Presse (Agence France-Presse) station journalists also observed a number of times near the Consulate in Chengdu, reporting that curious people were in constant circulation and that many parents were taking their children for walks to the Consulate, taking pictures of buildings, or taking self-ie pictures.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police occasionally “corrected” people's behaviour, which seemed to prevent any appearance: a woman had been stopped just after she had begun to sing red songs, and a guard had confiscated a banner.
But the inhabitants of a nearby residential building succeeded in lifting a huge Chinese flag from their balcony and chanting slogans in support of China.
The Chengdu Consulate opened in 1985 and covers all consular-related matters of the United States in the south-west of China, in particular the Tibet Autonomous Region.
According to the Agence France Presse journalist, the Chinese Government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese online demanded that the United States Consulate in Hong Kong be closed, but the official simply said that “the closure of the Consulate in Chengdu was a necessary and legitimate response to the United States' unreasonable conduct”.
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States is based in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and the Consulate of Hong Kong.
We're on the move for a large-scale integrated media campaign called "River Village Live to see Poverty Out" - and today's highlights - the Hunan Daily News.
On 25 July, two caravans carrying a 5G mobile cloud broadcasting system were delivered to a live guest, from Jiangsu Xu Xu County, under the auspices of the Central Radio and Television Finance and Economics Centre, by the Hunan Daily News, New Hunan client, on 25 July.
“The year 2020 is a landmark year, as stated by Xi Jinping General Secretary, for the full realization of a small and prosperous society and the achievement of the first century's struggle, and the year 2020 as the year of the decisive battle against poverty”.
The large-scale integrated media campaign " Villages live to see out of poverty " is an important initiative of the Central Radio and Television Financial and Economic Centre to complement this major theme in its campaign against poverty.
It will enter the poverty-eradication villages of more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central authority of the country, digging out the story of the living out of poverty, confronting the dramatic changes in the village and showing how the villagers have broken through the path of survival and development and the path to prosperity.
The operation will last for more than three months.
From Xuzhou, the journalist travelled two ways along the south-west line, via Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, etc., and the north-west route, via Henan, Xinxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Neo-Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, etc., for more than 10,000 kilometres.
In the form of the report, the Village Live to see Poverty Out was boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages to which the caravan arrived will be broadcast through the Central Radio and Television Central Radio and Economic Channel, Guo Guang ' s Economic Voice, China ' s Transport Radio, and the new financial media.
Of these, the live television coverage will be completed in the midday news programme, The Economy of the World, which is mainly on the Finance Channel (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 12 noon to 13 p.m.), and the Golden News section, Economic Information Network, of the Finance Channel, which will open a special section on combating poverty (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 20:30 to 21:30).
At the same time, caravans will broadcast live for up to one hour to each of the villages visited by viewing the finance business clients, with viewers downloading the finance business APP, allowing them to watch the live and participate in the drawings.
In technology applications and studio design, Village Live to see Poverty Out, the first of its kind, was a “new out-of-the-field media caravan”.
On board the 5G-new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, using 5G+4K/8K+AI technology, the vehicle brings about an organic combination of online, big screens and television broadcasts.
A three-instance broadcast area is configured, which is converted from containers, 12 metres long, 2.55 metres wide and 3.98 metres high, with a hydraulic self-dismantling structure of the box, with a maximum capacity of 120 degrees up.
The broadcast area can also be automatically opened and extended outside the platform, with an area of more than 50 square metres, to meet most of the programme ' s scenario requirements.
The present district of Dongchuan, Kunming City, is already a summer inflamed, while the weather is more intense than weather in order to relocate the anti-poverty workshop near the settlement site.
“Now, as soon as you leave the house, you go to the factory, make money and pay for it, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade unions.”
Entering the Bronze Street Electronics Processing Anti-Poverty Workshop in the Eastkawa region, a hot, busy picture of the sky was brought into the blinds.
Lew Ling, over 40 years old, is a single mother with children and also takes care of elderly parents.
At her most difficult time, the Dongchuan General Union helped to figure out a way to “steal in the snow” after running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has benefited from housing, schooling, social security, employment, etc., as well as from support provided by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child successfully graduated and became employed, and she herself became employed and earned an income after participating in skills training and was released at the end of April.
According to the information received, the special skills training project of the General Organization of Dongchuan Region to help lift out of poverty is part of the skills training of the General Union of Yunnan Province.
In conjunction with the characteristics of the disadvantaged workers of the relocation centres in the region, an in-depth survey was carried out to identify training needs and types of training, with a total of 450 electricians, welders, pastors, etc. planned to be trained in the near future.
Recently, the agricultural bank, Yunnan Munyan County Branch, Li Yi, wrote a heartfelt letter of thanks to the county trade union.
In her letter, she expressed her sincere gratitude to the trade union for giving her a study grant in Kim Autu between August 2013 and January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi ' s father died as a result of a car accident and the mother was included in the records of workers in difficulty, and has since benefited from the establishment of the card-setting policy.
With the help of local trade unions, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3809 families have been released from detention through institutional safeguards and precision support.
The successful release of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of Yunnan's union's push for the relief of workers in need.
According to the Chief of Staff of the General Union of Yunnan, the Ministry of Law and Defence of Rights Department, the province has been strengthening the dynamic management of files of workers in difficulty, promoting the regularization of the slotting process and the timely integration into the support system of workers in need who meet the requirements for slotting; expanding access to applications from workers in need; and using micro-letters to open online a filing service platform for workers in difficulty to facilitate the timely and voluntary declaration of workers in need.
During the period of the epidemic, the difficulty of going out to work, and in order to help people in difficult circumstances ease the stress of their lives, Yunnan has arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan for the provision of warm funds for the provision of warm condolences to more than 6,000 families in difficult circumstances at the national level and more than 1,000 families in difficult circumstances at the provincial level, in accordance with the standard of 1,500 yuan per household per worker in difficult circumstances at the national level.
At the same time, various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the Department of the General People ' s Society and IUPU recruitment, are connected, sending information on recruitment to workers in need and providing services such as employment counselling, employment guidance, etc.
