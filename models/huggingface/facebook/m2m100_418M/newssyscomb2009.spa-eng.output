Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right party.
A strong and special loss has suffered the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously plunged.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, which loses a 5.5 percent of votes compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse has yet ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic results in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the postwar and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for leaving the government to ship.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party’s president and, until today, vice-cancelarian, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could already be achieved on Monday at the party’s presidential meeting.
Such evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view that the strengthening of both populist right-wing parties – the liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, an eleven percent of the votes – and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unity, but in the year 2005 it disintegrated from the BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution clearly bets Haider who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
Also the Green Party has managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the 4% limit and therefore, it is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool up
If the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting scarabages cannot be solved, it could lead to a cooling of the Czech-India relations, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said.
This is what the minister said in New York after the meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then yes, then yes it would be safe to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized by Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from accusation and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter lies.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, that he would appeal to the highest instances.
He may then request the exemption from the case and wait for the judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
“It advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the indulgence would be possible,” the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is by obtaining the convicted a "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that this kind of support is already achieved by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest inining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, before its colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of the Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve got a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech Arbitration Struggle in the Sea
I approach an electronic wall map, which represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and alongside it also the sea background that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
His head, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and, sometimes, the complete.
Govern this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The sea background hides to date a world unknown, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms so far that in themselves carry the key for the development of cancer drugs.
The ground is greater than the firm ground.
Coastal countries have begun today to struggle for new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
“Simply, by continental border it is understood the part of the sea bottom and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the twenty sea miles, that is, pure economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the continental border’s external boundaries, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
This is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert assistance committee.
The Commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domination.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the surface of sea ground that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e., almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain for their study.
The profits that will be derived from the use of the marine fund will be, as they promise, invalid.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They can do so up to ten years from the moment they ratified the “Montego Bay Treaty”.
Where the continental border ends, the Oceanic bottom region begins, declared by the Treaty as the “common inheritance of mankind.”
Now here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The marine fund, however, is not any gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphasizing adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the marine fund belongs also to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then East Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in the year 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the ability to explore in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is accidentated, it’s something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetal concreation plates that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concreation.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which, according to the legend, revived the Golem.
During the release of the prisoners, the command of the German Special Forces was in the place of action.
To resolve the prison crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, the German Special Forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Therefore at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the aircraft squadron of the federal police, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation as well as the experts in the field of logistics of the technical beneficial institution.
As ministry spokesmen on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escape.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid from Germany to use it as support in the place.
“Unfortunately, that moment has not arrived,” a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian accompanents.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the prisoners were deported from one side to the other in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the detainees were under the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At the beginning in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, five tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States does not approve the rescue package
The first House of Congress of the United States has failed a large $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
Dow Jones has fallen very drastically.
The House of Representatives of the United States rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government’s package for saving the financial markets.
Despite all the calls of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince the critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the MPs to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened,” he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report increased number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened counture the desire to travel by the Germans remains as before.
As on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a volume of sales that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the GfK Market Research Institute, reserves for autumn months had already risen in number.
So the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was 11 percent higher compared to 2007, DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened price of the dollar, travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to a third.
The favorite destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Particularly organized trips are very preferred, says Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices rise, in this case travel expenses are “better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip.”
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose – although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
The first Oktoberfest
The hits of the holidays under the open sky at the endless balneary, the beer in one-litre jarras and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes from designers.
A debut in a campaign store.
Susanne Kronzucker and I have little in common.
She is a blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already used.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in the campaign store, photographers have already precipitated towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos – it’s very lisonero especially because I’m the first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costume seems to meet its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado of Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costume or leather pants; no one seems to be noticed or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my delantal receives rare sights next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention on my delantal that I had dressed in the wrong way: “the left is single, the half is virgin, the right is committed, behind is widow.”
Oh God, now I’m pulling back to the left.
“It’s okay,” he says laughing.
Others don’t worry about many of the subtle methods of flirting and carry hats where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him it looks “gorgeous”, which pronounces with a very long “or”.
I’m telling it after having put his glass of a litre of beer that he just drank.
He put it directly next to the fire mouth, most people think that’s a rubber.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others don’t have much luck and can’t consume so much alcohol.
Around eight in the night, healthcare groups run through the party place and have to worry about the poor drunken.
Healthcare workers appear every time in group – suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered roads from one campaign store to the other.
That works as with the majority of visitors: They arrive sober, they return dirty.
It is not known who suffers from the levels of alcoholemia and is on the edges.
“They’re those who can’t get more,” a health care provider answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
Victim of accident identified by police
It has been identified the 63 year old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the county of Essex.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released under fiance.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers encouraged the desire to penetrate within the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps toward Asia, one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition is found.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to hole the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, seeming to all a typical German municipality.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once overcome the turnover, there is no doubt what was the greatness of the company that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that curates to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low.
British domination and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad too for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has gone down and has remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s will to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of cooperation.
The Turkish governmentins excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a line and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a shock journey, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus.
That has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel – built ad hoc – in a suburb in development, surrounded by middle-built shopping centers and “pastelleries of power” where middle-class managers in business dress – men and women – gather at the first hour of the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Dress, corbata, I’m sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut into relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both things.
“But at some point,” I ask you, “ could Turkey be forced to choose?”
“Turkey,” he replies, “will not endow that election.”
Then he emphasizes a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken so far had recited me almost of memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those rail lines that open the world to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German gentlemen, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they be surprised to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, largely, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is no doubt in what continent this fascinating country should claim.
Review: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (shell, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford and Crown Philharmonic Orchestra.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth chorus, Proteus.
It is supposed to be for the minors under 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were ending the 20 years - we only refused to give up to the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the shapes) represented the will of the chorus and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether not accompanied or full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth chorus was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to “lat the music speak for itself.”
He would say, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in music.
That’s what we just have to sing!”
Its varita was always absolutely clear and accurate, although never impositive, nor too flowerful.
Whatever the musical scarring, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner says:
If any driver should have been a rider, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially over the past 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by no one, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world."
We will miss a lot.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequela of William Woodruff (September 25) stated that "in 1946 he re-started the studies of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, one of master's and one of doctor's."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff’s author in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not completely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overcome this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco y vida’ because his photographs in white and black, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was attracted to the attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second attack on Honda's survivors
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolum presents an even wider interior space.
All of this includes refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is possible to point out an innovative design, a new platform, greater dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model it is to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Approximately a million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would be a growth of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the officials of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly palliate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand officials expect to finish the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Also, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To this quota, Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It’s the Insight, a five-door and compact size hybrid – 4.37 meters long – of which the Japanese company expects to market around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in society in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotes.
Its length rises to the 3.90 meters (five more centimeters), the width to the 1.69 meters (two more centimeters) and the distance between axes to the 2.50 meters, which implies an increase of five centimeters.
The height, in turn, does not vary and isined at the 1,52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the internal habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel deposit in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the suitcase - which has a double-ground system - rises to the 399 liters, 19 liters more of the capacity of the first generation suitcase.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine as the baggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as back LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is a improvement in access to the back places.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees, against the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline propulsors.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves less consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refining and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4 900 rounds.
This propulsor – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – has a spending of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now passes to have 100.
This 1.4 100 horse Jazz achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car to Avoid Collisions
To advance in the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo, in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four areas Security Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of the brand’s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space with oval shape that looks very much like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important is the composite eyes of the bee, able to see with a angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an approach microprocessor that, immediately, translates into collision prevention.
“At the time it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels in a straight or greater angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If not so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike an apple, the robot cannot be turned up or down, nor in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like the apples.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotating function, in addition to acceleration and slowdown, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic of previous maneuver, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we’re not talking about memory gigs, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new technology for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaticina that will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Issue before mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking ingenuity.
In front of the crisis, and to prevent the Americans from embarking on waste mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a gentle and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
This is the “Hotel of the Bad Credits” or “Hotel of the Bad Credits”.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it’s time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It has useful, but little detailed information.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for all the public.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because of buying a better house we don’t talk...
Morgan Stanley to sell to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong decline in its stock exchange.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a 10% yield and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measurement of $29, which is 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley stock lost 6.79% to $23,07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, the U.S. group’s chief executive.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the bigger names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, said in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, "we thought the participation would have been made up of ordinary actions only.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wish to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able within a year to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if these are sold with more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. $47 more or less, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital contributed by MUFG will allow you to capture investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokesman for the group refused, however, to give precisions about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan must have relieved much its balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw its stock exchange rate falling half while the security cost against a risk of defects over its debt dropped.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other only "supervivent" of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced to have raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refunding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote for a new Constitution.
Mission fulfilled since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of suffrages.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of suffrages were zero votes and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the suffrages plus one.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exit of the electoral centers and a part of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory to the "yes", estimating it between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians that head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
So, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies the increase of the power of the State over the economy, reserving the “development planning” of a country that lives essentially thanks to the oil extraction by foreign companies and thanks to currencies that send its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also gives reinforced powers to the head of state, which will be able to make up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and would pretend a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of the free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives under the threshold of poverty.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for the U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault against the raptors of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanyers captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unlikely in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian Special Forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 15h30 on board a special airplane to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to the international airport of Cairo.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be submitted to medical tests, so they couldn’t talk to the press.
“They are well in health” and “no rescue was paid” to the kidnappers, Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these prisoners fell in power by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all-terrenes in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they passed from one bull to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the Special Forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before Dawn.
"A shooting exchange occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the man who kept the anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces of the Lightning Unit were sent to Sudan, where they counted with the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces,” he said.
He also denied the payment of a rescue.
On the eve the Sudanese army said it had intercepted during a patrol a all-terrain on board which were the kidnappers, of whom he killed six, among them the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also said they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an affirmation immediately denied by this group.
Lyrics - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable amounts that are granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or to national historical places that die of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that has neglected its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros to restore it only the Chinon Castle in the Loira Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people aggregated in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching for history, preserving with little money a lot of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the dogs guardians of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemetery.
For when, a monument for history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands – being the first in Europe – will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Netherlands bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the U.S. mortgage crisis: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s economic competition manager.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Eurozone crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis that comes producing in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a certain sense, can be considered precedent.
According to the decision adopted on Sunday morning, the three States will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property that the Bank possesses in its area.
The Bank will safely sell a part of its business, among them especially the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis’ actions started a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week, important signs of crisis were already seen in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too big to allow it to break down.
The company’s shares just on Friday dropped by 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the share value has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Observing the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s headquarters imputed the sharp fall of the Fortis shares to the uncertainty of the U.S. market in connection with the approval of the U.S. package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new chief executive of the bank.
The bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors didn’t have to worry, they won’t lose their money.
Among the customers of the Bank so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
The chicken in the chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies when seeing the data of the purchase of medication, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy Policy experts fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
“There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data from the recipes in all cases connects it with the approval of the person given.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken to the puppy" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the designer of the medical recipes tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and compensation amount depend on the customer’s health status and if they think the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to medical check and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check.
Dick decades ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number it easily gets from the pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself makes the conclusion about the disease and the customer’s health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of blood fat is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risk, so the insurance company in addition to the administration barely has something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medications are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
This latter is a major risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first does not.
Special companies were established to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities have already forced them to do so, although they have not received a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies recently also elaborate the results of laboratory examinations and by combining them with the drug consumption data get more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
It is already before the Congress the draft law that gives the right to authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite all, are exposed to the good will of the dog.
The Global Menu of Marsella
EU doubles trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this topic in addition to the other majority global issues dominated the day order of the ninth summit.
Today will also be held a Franco-Indian summit, to discuss primarily on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit initiated yesterday in Marsella.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU president of turn, Commission president José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, i.e. increase to more than a billion euros, their trade exchange.
Having in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
Thus, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements existing with India have legally harmonised, so air transportation will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade treaty with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is the balance, because while the EU is India’s first trade partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the trade partners of the EU.
The summit focused on global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism – all forms of the latter – and accepted the convocation of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also appreciated, although both sides have great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate program, i.e. it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India is also agreeing to this, just as the next year’s climate conference should reach a global agreement and decrease by 50 percent greenhouse gas production by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convocation of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive charges worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

It will follow a meeting with the stamp at the Room Struktur on the Bookmesse pavilion 5.0: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospectives on the state of the publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors decreases gradually over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Previous articleSteve Fossett’s missing millionaire is found
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire missing on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert have been found.
The ruins have been found on a height of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has dissipated the doubts that remained: "The plane has been localized, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is own of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a press conference.
According to the report, no human remains have been found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been given for dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has that some hours after the remains were noticed, a team of researchers has been sent to identify the apparatus: it is own of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of premiums.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the tour of the world in an aerostatic globe: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the tour of the world by plane and without scales.
Among his record, also that for having flighted at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a copiloto.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A SUV out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terrain "compacts" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper by the content out of the traditional, it will be unexpected and not conventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms from the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car would launch an unpublished communication modality through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central street of the Milan shopping, Avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication would begin with the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Effectively, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, to compone in one image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It’s clear who the Italians are.
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys whose Italy is now shameful? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that so far, to say the truth, has never created too many problems.
They never met with the rival’s fans.
The group extraction is right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (small units, in reality) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so that they are not identified.
It is inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazis fans, the Levsky.
Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 entries for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the Interior Minister had already controlled them all: among what they had gone out for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, no one that had prohibited him from frequenting a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had history of crime at stadiums, were rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Interior Ministry is waiting to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (interdiction of access to sports events) international that prevents frequenting not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans will not put a foot on a stadium.
Fortunately !
But now there is the fear of imitation: to those few fifty, add others.
“We have to immediately shut down this fire and not legitimate who is behaving in this way,” the Interior Ministry said.
That’s why, “goodly open ears” especially in view of the Wednesday’s National Party in Lecce.”
In Apulia there is also a small core of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory, Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce coros and the arm lifted during the Mameli hymn? in Bulgaria it's not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in a unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (ha taken the position that before was of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of the Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It’s true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it’s not a crime to celebrate the Twelve but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist – adds the Observatory’s No. 1 – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the silbids to Mameli’s hymn: they are also not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not of education.
