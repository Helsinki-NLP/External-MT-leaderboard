The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom has been increasing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar patterns across EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although the phases vary from country to country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should step up their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially: intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogenicity were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a new coronavirus as the pathogenic medium, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) because it was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them have recovered.
14% of cases of COVID-19 are of more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% are of severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we evaluated the combined patterns of COVID-19 cases in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with cases in Italy between 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread further geographically and the rest of the world COVID-19 pandemic figures are now tracking the situation in this country.
On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO).
The 5 March publication of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by WHO.
In the EU/EEA, France notified the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had reported cases of COVID-19, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting the combined number of COVID-19 cases and combined incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from every country worldwide, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as the country's Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare them to cases in Italy.
As a sample of the extent of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the combined 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented the aggregate number of reported cases in each country as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am and compared them with the cases in Italy between 31st January and 15th March 2020.
The nature of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The overall pattern of 14-day split combined cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK is similar to Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall in the EU/EEA and UK, the combined cases of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then began to increase rapidly by 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This mainly included the rapidly increasing reported cases in Italy but also all other EU/EEA countries and the UK were also showing a similarly increasing pattern of combined COVID-19 cases (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy between 31 January-15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of 8 am on 15 March, the same number of cases as in Italy had already been reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK in the three weeks prior or less.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed pattern in the combined cases of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing relatively rapidly in all countries.
Further, as different countries are at different stages, the gaps between national public health responses and the possible definition of different cases between countries and different protocols of patient selection need to be examined for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media sources indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or intensive care for COVID-19 patients are currently available for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively at EU/EEA level (data not shown).
However, they need to compile current surveillance data in a consistent systematic manner that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there is a huge disparity in the number of ICU and Medium-Care beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and Medium ICU beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK is a sample situation associated with saturation of healthcare capacity is associated with a > 90% risk of exceeding ICU bed capacity, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are still limited to certain regions of EU/EEA countries and UK and hospitals and intensive care units provide treatment to certain regional populations, case and ICU information should preferably be made available in the definition of regional centres for the statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current pattern in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs need to prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially intensive care, as has been the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment shows, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to eradication is needed rather than delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented early, the rapidly anticipated increase in such cases will not allow decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and assimilate their response.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further scale up their efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA countries' healthcare systems will face a surge of patients who will require intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, and has been a disaster for humanity.
Like its homologous SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS deaths in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted from bats and exhibited similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and deadly than SARS but is more transmissible and is more common in older people than younger people and more common in men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the research topic being developed.
We have covered the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and combat this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese people who were told to stay home for the entire holiday and several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new infectious disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COV Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had affected 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020, which has led to the sequencing of the virus in addition to various patients.
This review attempts to summarise research progress in new and slowly evolving subject areas.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some remaining but pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-life-threatening pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of colds.
However, we have seen two very deadly human CoVs in this century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which first emerged in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to other countries with extremely deadly morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recent human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoVs was released.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
Healthcare providers were reported to have been infected on 20 January, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under full lockdown and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first medical study on the disease indicated that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had come from direct contact with a Wuhan seafood market which was thought to be the initial infection centre from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2.2).
The final status and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain as the situation is changing rapidly.
A multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 presents an updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages but mainly targeted people aged 30-65.
Half of the infected (47.7%) were above 50 years of age, very few were below 20 years of age and only 14 infected were below 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.27/1,00,000) than women (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 mainly spread to Hubei and surrounding urban groups.
The average time from infection to diagnosis of COVID-19 is 5 (2-9) days.
The average retention period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproductive count (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased dramatically before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the large pre-Spring Festival outbreak in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and overlapping subfamily of viruses that include a single strand of sens RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the plasma; after replication of the virus genome, genomic RNA forms a virion-containing vesicle with overlapping glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new variant of beta-CoV that has been identified with 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples taken from the outbreak's origin, the Huannan Seafood Market in Huan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in extremely thin areas of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 more weakly than the S proteins of SARS-CoV, which coincidentally leads to less severe infections due to SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new small proteins, encoded by orf3b and the spliced protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit IFNß expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or target.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported that the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution was miscible with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the structure of the worm, which was open and closed, was combined as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate hosts
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans from eating cats and camels, respectively.
Genetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs suggested that bats were considered local hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to SARS-like CoVs of bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is unknown which intermediate carriers helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggest that snakes must be carriers for the transmission of S proteins from bats to humans, with homologous recombination occurring between S proteins.
A study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggests that long-nosed, ant-eating eaten cats widely used in traditional medicine in China may be potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, for which the CoV found in eaten cats and SARS-CoV-2 have a 99% genetic similarity.
However, the 1% gap between two genomes is still a large gap, so we are waiting for solid evidence for a conclusive conclusion (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive at 20°C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive in ultraviolet radiation and at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other mild solvents other than chlorhexidine can effectively neutralize it.
Generally, the entire human race is not able to cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no extensive studies have been conducted regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, in particular: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, when a virus attacks a host, it is first recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interference (INN), which limits viral spread and accelerates macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus survive the immune response.
Soon, a favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, along with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a key role in defence.
CD4+ T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the rescue cells.
However, COVID T cells can inhibit function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immune system, which includes elements and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from healed patients have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system leads to the production of large local clumps of free cells which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst case can cause organ damage and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection with community-initiated onset is most likely to occur in older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
Individuals who have other diseases or whose immune systems are weakened are more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases lasting 3-7 days, as in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, the most recent study shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days in the population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for healthcare officials to coordinate effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period, which will prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general measure, people who have been in contact with or infected with the virus should be isolated for a maximum of 14 days.
Is it necessary to quarantine for 24 days?
This is the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, fever, muscle stiffness, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of becoming ill.
In severe cases, patients are immediately diagnosed with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even if they have pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98 per cent fever, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent dyspnea and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent patients required ventilation support.
Two recent studies on a group of people infected by a family group and a person without symptoms have also found similar findings.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and MERS was more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of 14 February, when the number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%.
In comparison, the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
Previous studies had suggested that SARS-CoV-2 had an RO as high as 6.47 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV had an RO between 2 and 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO are given in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal of the two.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The group initiation often started in the same family or with the same ceremony or with the same vessel, such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have had contact with infected individuals, or within the last two weeks before the outbreak.
However, it has been suggested that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, prompting warnings to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreasing number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L including < 1×109/L lymphocyte count and advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia were found.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte coatings were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the fibrin degradation product D-dimer in the blood had increased levels and lymphocyte counts had decreased rapidly.
Most COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilateral patch shadows or ground glass obesity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention and progressive dark intensity severely affect air exchange.
Damage to type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes causes a decrease in surface level and increased surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to spread and increases the risk of lung damage.
So, the worst radiographic results are often the same as the most serious illness.
The first diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that the decesqueme of pneumocytes, formation of a germicidal membrane and penetration of central lymphocytes and multicellular syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease were consistent with diagnoses of viral infection and ARDS and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate accelerating the pandemic, the use of medical manifestations for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) started in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation emerged with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of output) within one hour without the need for extensive tools using a dipstick.
It is hoped that if validated in clinical samples, the new technique could dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, clinicians can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and try out various treatment modalities that have been used or proposed previously for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Not only that, but it was also proposed to use cells from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly trying to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys to some extent.
Thus, respiratory failure and malfunction are a major risk factor for patients and a leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock and treatment, protecting vital organ function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that in SARS and MERS patients, an additional immune system response results in a cytokine storm.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is manifested by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies are used to treat cytokine storm to corticosteroids and tocilisumab.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune responses, inhibition of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, Blenetumomab, a suppressor of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, particularly: avascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect diagnosis.
However, short-term use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses is being advised for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment had been confirmed.
However, remdesivir has been shown to be effective when given intravenously to a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Zelid to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir showed potential inhibition for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, GILID supplied the components to China for testing on patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricTNB, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir may lead to diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effects of these treatments on other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies are produced from recovered patients.
The collection of blood from patients recovered from infectious diseases has a long history of being used to treat patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from becoming ill.
It is true that the blood of recovered patients has a higher number of antibodies than the pathogenic ones.
The antibodies to fight pathogens and other foreign substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) produced by B lymphocytes that recognize specific molecules in pathogens and directly destroy them.
Based on this, cells were collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients with severe illness were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, along with reduced inflammation and viral pressure and improved blood oxygenation.
However, until specific treatments are developed, further verification and clarification is required for widespread use.
At the same time, some disadvantages associated with cells need to be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal in form.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells is high to treat critically ill patients.
Specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic are difficult to develop and produce rapidly.
Therefore, it is important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or test for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies at a faster rate.
TCM has been used in China to treat various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula according to the TCM theory of disease diagnosis.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or uncertain because such ingredients or their highest combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
With the current lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become an alternative treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
The highest recovery rates were reported in various provinces of China using TCM to treat COVID-19 at 87% of patients including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this is a comparison of some size because other impact factors such as number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bui Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) alone with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time to body temperature reversal, symptom resolution and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic increase (mild to severe) was much lower in WM+TCM than in WM group alone (7.4% vs 46.2%) and the mortality rate in WM+TCM group was also much lower than in WM group alone (8.8% vs 39%).
However, large scale well-controlled trials in more centres are needed to ensure the effectiveness and safety of TCM.
It would be somewhat strange to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatments or if possible their combinations.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 often experience highly contagious or life-threatening illness and those in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic stimuli, delusional symptoms, delusions and suicidal thoughts were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and isolation as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people even more anxious about infection, isolation and guilt among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and people in their contact as well as to the general population in need.
The mental support includes setting up of multidimensional mental health group, regular and clear dialogue on accurate news and treatment plans regarding SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, use of professional power tools and use of apps to avoid close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are needed to break the chain of transmission from animal to susceptible hosts and can often be used effectively as antiviral therapy to control epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts are being made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-lasting and effective antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, the physiological performance and life-challenge patterns and protective factors against animal-transmitted viral infections in elderly subjects have not yet been identified in the candidates administered the vaccine prior to clinical trials.
This may be because the impact of SARS ended only 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, isolated cases and some mass outbreaks of MERS have emerged in the Far Eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions indicating the presence of animal-transmitted sources in the epidemic region.
A vaccination strategy for MERS was developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the obstacle is challenging as it requires a long time (average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and a dynamic variant of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has now begun to show its full curative sequence in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare institutions to establish diagnostic models to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients aged 50 years and above who had COVID-19 were aged between 30-65.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (51 versus 66 at median age), suggesting age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart failure and arrhythmia.
Heart disease was also a leading cause of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE-2 positive colangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the relationship between age and current illness is important and can influence each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are a potentially chronic diagnostic factor for illness, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with COVID-19 severity and prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and are released in tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional indicators for heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient increase in medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other problems to predict the prognosis and severity of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used as adjunctive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
The widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in severe SARS patients has led to many survivors suffering from chronic osteoporosis, including lifelong disability and decreased life expectancy.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they had to live in isolation for long periods and in very precarious conditions and witnessed the death of family members and loved ones.
Providing psychological counselling and long-term support is essential to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can replicate more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and may be mild or have no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
Thus, infected patients in the early stages or retention period can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities, which can make it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, while SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread when patients are critically ill, most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
China is currently undergoing extensive efforts, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the permanent quarantine of almost the entire population, in order to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing and this is seen to slow the pandemic.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, PhD, predicts that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group has reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in mid-turbinate and throat swabs from a patient who was discharged from hospital 2 weeks after recovering from illness, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be in a flu-like cyclical sequence.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which shows the positive impact of current policies.
Ebola was initially projected to cause one million cases and five million deaths.
However, due to strict quarantine, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken to ineffectiveness and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS pandemics is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing and can also be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, raising the possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases suggested that 41% of cases may have been due to hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and not only, but also third parties who come into contact with sick or infected people.
The first step of protection to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) both help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from potentially infected persons from passing through the air to the surface of the material, thus preventing their transmission to others.
However, only N95 (Series #1860) masks can stop respiration of microviruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can also enter through five surgical masks one on one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series #1860) without using surgical masks.
Besides masks, healthcare providers are also required to wear fitted isolation gowns to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.
On 20 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
The distance of three feet is considered to be the proper distance for people to keep away from the patient.
These actions are considered effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a novel virus, as reported on 7 January 2020, it was homologous to SARS-CoV, so memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak should have sounded a warning bell in China.
However, even on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was telling people that the new virus is less contagious and less reproducible from human to human and that the disease is not difficult to prevent and control at all.
This message greatly reduced the public's sense of caution, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and Wuhan missed a crucial time to contain the disease to a minimum.
The CDC in China can learn from this hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.
For example, these organizations should take the following precautions: (1) be more careful when making public announcements as every word spoken to citizens is important and can therefore change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) impose more restrictions to prevent a potential pandemic at an early stage rather than reassure the public; and (4) issue targeted and effective drills from time to time to increase public awareness of the pandemic and test and improve community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new virus SARS-CoV-2 that started in late December 2019.
Within two months of this writing, it had spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak created a feeling of SARS returning.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older people than younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so only when they are seriously ill, making it much harder to stop the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become positive again due to the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of the virus spreading.
This rapid progress in COVID-19 research has not addressed many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Which animal was the medium species for transmitting the virus from the original host, bats or humans?
Without knowing the answers to # 1 and # 2, we cannot effectively stop infection and the outbreak can come back anytime.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently alter the diagnosis?
Does the virus bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during infection in humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, a SARS-like extinction, or will it continue to come like the flu?
These and many other questions need to be answered, but it may take time.
However, we have no choice but to bring the pandemic under control as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
The animal origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host including humans has been driven by mutations and adaptations.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses like colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have highlighted how devastating and deadly HCoV infections can be.
The coronavirus resurfaced in late 2019 in central China with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and we were surprised by its high transmissibility but its low pathogenicity compared to its homologous SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is in our interest to understand the origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV mediated parasitic hosts are also known.
Identification of animal nutrients can have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of the interaction of the COVID-positive in animals can shed light on important information on the human COVID pathogen.
In this review, we are reviewing the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a primary focus on their history of discovery as well as their animal origin and intercellular transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful nutritional replacement and the impact of viral evolution on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (COV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of embedded, positive-sensing, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The largest of these RNA viruses, with a genome size of 26 to 32 kilobases, are called "COVs" because they look like a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are designated as NSP1 through 16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Numerous gene-specific helper proteins are also encoded by different genes of the COVID.
According to the different protein sequences, COVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation contains the highest number of HCOVs and is divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice serve as genetic sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main hosts for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, COVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
At present, seven human CoVs (ACOVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, producing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high proportion of patients who are at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E variant, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of common cold patients in 1960.
Since then, more knowledge had been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
However, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely believed that HCoV infections were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with an estimated 10% crude case fatality rate.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) outbreak resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread rapidly to the rest of the world.
The novel HCoV-2019 (2019-nCoV-2), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is constantly ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs have animal-borne diseases originating in bats, mice or pets.
Various evidence supports the theory of bat origin, in which viruses have taken over the condition and are not pathogenic but exhibit extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the animal disease of ACOV reveals the natural history, driving forces and constraining factors behind the species leap.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of the host, intermediate and propagator parasite (V) nutrients of SARS-CoV-2, which will play a key role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide an overview of the origins of animal diseases, interspecies infections and pathogenicity of HCOV.
In particular, we highlight the following general topics and discuss how the parent virus of HCoV is not normally pathogenic in its natural parasitic host but becomes pathogenic when it is introduced into a new host by an interspecies infection.
We also looked at the evolutionary art of HCoVs, which is that if you increase infectivity, you decrease pathogenicity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal COVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E pathogen B814 from nasal secretions of cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from various infected animals including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E variant was isolated in 1966 from patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently produced WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have reported cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, tingling and sore throat, along with fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from small mouse organ cultures and subsequently from a serial passage in the brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is not distinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are mainly transmitted during the winter season in low temperature environments.
Generally, the incubation period of infection with these two viruses is less than one week followed by about two weeks of illness.
Studies on human volunteers have shown that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed a mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems develop severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also called "atypical pneumonia", was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases, including 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
Without hyper-spreaders, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a boiling period of 4 to 7 days and a peak of viral effects on day 10 of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, chills and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and then shortness of breath.
Lymphocytic abnormalities, impaired liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities found in SARS laboratories.
Diffuse alveolar damage, enlargement of the abdominal cells and increase in macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also become infected with this serious disease, often resulting in a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, unlimited efforts have been made in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be more common in children, the elderly and patients with respiratory disease with weakened immune systems.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are commonly characterized by colds, eye pain, fever and pneumonia.
In another separate study, the same virus was isolated from the nasal secretion of an eight-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first discovered in the Netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its highest incidence occurs in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive esophagitis also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and pneumonia.
HCoV-HKU1 has been associated with acute asthma disorders including community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia.
HCoV-HKU1, like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, is also found worldwide causing mild respiratory illness.
Although all four community-acquired HCoVs have been well tolerated in humans and are unlikely to develop into serious pathogens, they can still cause accidents for unknown reasons, as in the case of the more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to infect efficiently and persist in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most of the confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases of secondary transmission were reported in various European countries and Tunisia due to close contact.
The second outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have experienced severe renal failure, which is very unusual for MERS in HCoV-borne diseases.
The number of patients with digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting was over 30%.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported with a fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humankind.
Between mid- to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases associated with the previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to emerge in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease as COVID-19.
As on 3rd March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, China's Hubei had a 4.2% case fatality rate, compared to 1.2 percent outside.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and pneumonia.
Some patients also developed diarrhoea.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they are in different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
As it turns out, SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals a large number of similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is showing characteristics that are common during HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms at all.
On the other hand, even though the incidence is low, there is a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by curious patterns of both community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is as transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission rate decreases when transmitted to humans, it remains to be verified whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 decreases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will determine whether fecal-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role as important as SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, as with community-acquired HCoV cases.
However, after transmission to humans, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its infectivity, pathogenicity and persistent transmission between humans, will be influential for the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
HCoVs from all four of the mildly symptomatic communities have been shown to be well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both may have survived an ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoVs that cause serious human disease and the HCoVs that cause serious human disease should be eradicated.
To make this happen, HCoVs must be allowed to replicate in humans to a degree sufficient to accumulate favorable mutations that would counteract the nutrient-inhibiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its spread from humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
Four community-acquired COVID-19 viruses have been transmitted to humans for years, causing colds in people with weakened immune systems.
These viruses do not need animal shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted properly to humans and their human-to-human transmission will not be permanent.
They should be maintained and propagated in their animal habitat and spread to susceptible human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying nutrients if possible.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It's highly contagious, at least for now, like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if they will be fully compatible with humans without any shelter or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, host, mediator and promoter of HCoV.
An animal can become a carrier of HCoV evolution if it has a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
In this strain, the ancestral virus is often adapted and not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasitic feeding provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the host is naturally infectious and the host is naturally infected with HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced into an intermediate host just before or during its introduction into humans, it does not adapt to new nutrients and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can then act as zoonotic hosts of human infection and act as propagating hosts, allowing the virus to replicate momentarily and then infect humans to increase the extent of human infection.
An HCoV infection can be terminated if it cannot maintain its infection in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can absorb intermediate nutrients and not only that, but can establish long-term pathogenicity.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural parasite nutrient.
Epidemiological data has predictively revealed that the first case of SARS has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
Masked Palm Civets (Paguma larvae) and Raccoon Dogs were first identified in live animal markets as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly fuelled by the fact that no more SARS was reported after all the civets in the market were killed.
However, it was also reported that masked palm civets from forests or farms not exposed to live animal markets were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be intermediate promoter nutrients but not natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so it is not excluded that different species of small mammals may also be acting as intermediate promoter nutrients for SARS-CoV.
These are all emerging as the final strains of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research into the natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV discovered a closely related bat COV, called SARS-related rhinolopus bat COV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
And these bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with other SARS-CoVs.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats feed on developing human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVs (SL-CoV) have been identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 has been isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a bat fecal sample that was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bat, civet and human ACE2 na cell entry.
Interestingly, the blood plasma of a recovering SARS patient was able to neutralize WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats that share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high homology between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that WIV1 is not the intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as COVID-HKU4 and Bat COVID-HKU5.
Bats are the recipients of COVID-HKU4 and MERS-CoV nutrients, using diapeptidyl peptidesase 4 (DPP4) to penetrate the virus.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of MERS-CoV is genetically close to the variants found in Bat Beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
Only 87% nucleotide sequence homology is found between MERS-CoV and its closely related bat COVID-HKU25.
Thus, bats may not be immediate parasitic carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have concluded that dromedary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific antibodies, such as camels of Middle Eastern descent found in several African countries.
Living MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from a nasal swab from a dromedary camel, further suggesting that camels act as beneficiary parasitic nourishers of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that a large number of MERS-CoVs, which are usually mildly symptomatic, have been experimentally identified as having taken up residence in infected camels.
It is worth mentioning that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of shelter for the bat virus.
However, the question remains that many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels before symptoms appear, no human-to-human transmission pathway, or no known transmission pathway in which unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV are likely to be the cause.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat-related COVID-RATG13 isolated from rhinolophus bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG-13 is very good for determining parental relationship.
This means that bats are unlikely to be immediate parasitic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, unless a similar bat-CoV is found in the future.
Most likely, the intermediate carrier of SARS-CoV-2 is a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, including several of the early COVID-19 related cases, which are indicative of the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Numerous recent research based on metagenomic sequencing has suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica - eaten cats) may also be home to SARS-CoV-2 related ancestor beta-CVO.
These new pangolins share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology of the C.O.V. genomes with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 by approximately 90% homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
They group SARS-CoV-2-like viruses into two sub-branches in the gene tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, identifying 97.4% of the amino acid sequence.
In a paradoxical truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more different, however, with a higher rate of genome-wide homology sequence.
Recent research on diseased pangolins has also reported the detection of viral layer on lung sample, which was found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The research adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to produce a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 is pangolins.
However, due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 is directly pandemic.
Further, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high degree of similarity between the RBD of the pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and the RBD of the selectively-drugged co-evolved ketella-carried SARS-CoV-2.
An alternative proposal is in the interest of recombination between the pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RATG13 in the tertiary wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the high pathogenicity of HCoVs, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Genetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both originated from bat COVs, while the parent virus of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 was found in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat-borne COV, ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) found in the North American Triangular Bat, has shown close association with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomally related to another bat-borne COV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camels were suspected as its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history has been presented through genetic analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 from domestic livestock crossed species to infect humans around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's interspecies transmission is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been identified.
One of them is alpaca alpha-CoV.
There are several levels of evidence supporting direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it is likely that humans, not alpacas, came into contact with bats in the shared environment.
Instead, humans have a closer relationship with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are isolated and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpacas alpha-CoVs have been linked to outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpacas alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas may have acquired HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it's no surprise that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, while alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediate hosts that can transmit the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of inter-species transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich stock of viral species for the interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
The ideal conditions of longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and flight capability have made bats ideal as 'virus carriers'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the dromedary camel for decades.
These camels have adapted well to them which has made them from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural parasitic nutrient.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their small number of human infections is an accident, and humans are the end-stage carriers of MERS-CoV because their infections are not chronic.
The role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission is different, in contrast to the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the Pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in the Pangolins.
They may be phase-positive for SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or rule out the numerous possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share this environment with bats by slaughtering them or by mining coal.
Second, pangolins, which may be one of the intermediate promoting nutrients for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that has been recently identified.
Human contact with viruses is through slaughterhouses and eating hunted fish.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Animal and wildlife surveys are required for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in third species that are exposed to bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the different types of animal nutrition, three key factors in favour of the COVID virus are also important in facilitating the crossing of the second species barrier.
First, they have relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of the COVID depends on the stage of adoption of the COVID by the new strain, with the average replacement rate considered "mild" to "high" with 2-4 replacements per year per 2 sites.
The COVID has a proof-reading exoribonuclease, which removal results in high levels of mutation survival and degeneration or even viability.
Surprisingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to replicate COV by inhibiting the inhibition of these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
One of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials is remdesivir.
However, the mutation rate of COVID is about a million times higher than their survival rate.
In addition, when COVIDs are not well tolerated by the host, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a higher level of acceptance in humans.
It's probably already been adopted by other closely related organisms.
As an add-on to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well tolerated by dromedary camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will make the effect against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly vaccine-preventable and antiviral.
Second, the large RNA genomes in COVs pull in an extra degree of flexibility in genome modification for mutation and recombination, increasing the possibility of interspecies co-evolution, which, when conditions become favourable, is beneficial for the emergence of novel COVs.
This is supported by a number of other open reading frames and by the activity of proteins encoded at the 3' end of the genome.
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replicas at random and at different frequencies through a "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the gut they act as mixing vessels, with strand switching occurring frequently during transcription of the C.O.V. RNA.
High levels of homologous full-length and sub-genomic RNA can be recombined to produce new COVIDs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal-borne COVs such as bat-borne SL-CoV and bat-borne COV-HKU9.
Interactions between virus and parasite in relation to infection
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during cases of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV appears to be rapidly adapted to different nutrients, especially with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
In general, in RBD in S proteins, COV interacts with a cellular receptor and is selectively activated by the antibody response of the nutrient.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are present in the S1 region of the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to the receptors for viral entry, similar to human ACE2.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows interspecies transmission of viruses capable of identifying ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, otters, mice and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were found to be isolated in the RBD between human and civet virus isolates, and four of these are located in the receptor-binding pattern for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In the case of CIVET SARS-CoV, K489N and S487T mutations are present in their RBD, which may enhance the desire for spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important in viral acceptance in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that their S protein's binding preference with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Of course, a cryomagneto-EM study showed that the desire of these hostages is 10 to 20 times greater than the desire of the bond between human ACE2 and SARS-CoVS proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-recipients are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
HCoV-NL63 would also probably bind to ACE2, but with a different S-terminus.
There are numerous other HCOV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful human transmission of these COVIDs after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
As an additive in cellular receptors, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors.
The decomposition of this nutrient protein between the natural accumulators of HCoVs, such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents, may inhibit interspecies transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission of HCoVs, nutrient dependence factors must be strengthened and nutrient restriction factors overridden.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this critical virus-protein interaction region have yet to be identified and characterized.
For SARS-CoV-2, non-biased screening of genome-wide and inhibitory factors of nutrient dependency using the state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: going back to zero.
The variation of bat COVs provides ample opportunity for emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, bat-borne COV is used as a genetic reservoir for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two key steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or damage of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is considered important for acceptance in humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are isolated but are found encoding abscess ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV has been shown to have a 29-nucleotide deletion trait in strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
With this deletion, ORF8 breaks down into ORF8a and ORAP8b and is considered an acceptable mutation, which promotes the migration of proteins.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which have been found to have a large number of small recombinant segments in RNA.
Recombination sites were also identified in NSP 9, most often in NSP 10, and parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV has experienced cases of recombination across different lineages, which have been detected in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been reported in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to unwanted alteration of the viral genome, often resulting in the release of the virus from selective pressure exerted by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the deletion of a full-length ORF4 by a deletion of a two-nucleotide in the HCoV-229E prototype genotype.
A single ORF4 group can be found in bat and camel viruses related to HCOC-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs exhibit single nucleotide incorporation, which results in frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by selective pressure within their parasitic host.
The symptoms, which are mild or mild, were observed when bats were infected with the COVID-19 virus, indicating a mutual acceptance between the COVID-19 virus and bats.
It seems that bats have adapted well to the COVID by physical sight and physical activity.
For example, a defect in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats reduces the effectiveness of the pathological therapies implemented by COV.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the upregulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of the major neurotransmitter complex class I molecule.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the high-metabolic activity of bats both suppress the COV replication activity and result in proofreading by exoribonucleases, thus when new nutrients are introduced, the lineage origin of the virus provides a selective pressure to become pathogenic in large numbers.
More pathogenic COV genes also evolve in recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to absorb nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not emerged by accident in the last two decades.
COVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic hosts such as bats or camels.
Those strong nutrients replicate normally without destroying the immune response.
Here lies the secret of why the vectors appeared and what is causing the serious problem in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to high activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, whereas where the immune response is stronger, more severe forms of lung damage appear.
In contrast, in the short-term carrier, the immune response is decoupled from the replication of the COVID.
This may be a beneficial strategy to break the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 antiretroviral therapies.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inhibitor in bats is defective.
For this reason, co-synthesis of the NLRP3 inflammatory agent MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern, which is followed by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In contrast, bat beta-CoVs were found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, whereas bat-CoVs also share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, even though the market for mosquitoes and other animals has been found to host viruses like SARS-CoV, there are no immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 to Pangolins beta-CoV has been found to be surprising, suggesting that pangolins may have functioned as one of the intermediate hosts or that Pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed genetic fragmentation to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The question remains, however, that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought the COVIDJ back into the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of parasitic nutrition of HCoVs in animal origin and human infection.
The evidence of the outbreak showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had a bat origin and its transmission to humans was through intermediate hosts.
The origin of SARS-CoV infection was through human-cat contact in the market, the closure of the seafood market and killing of the wild cats there effectively ended the SARS-CoV pandemic.
For the same reason, in view of the finding of a close link between the multiple strains of pangolins beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal transmission.
However, future research remains to explain why and how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
It is an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, hides and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels should be undertaken with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eradicate these viruses, new genetic variants can emerge to cause outbreaks.
In the wild, there are also many animal species that roam the sea.
Especially, the bat COVs are very diverse with animal-borne potential.
There are numerous opportunities for this animal-borne COVID to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new COVIDs of a more transmissible and/or lethal nature in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
In the case of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a well-designed preparedness and response plan must be in place.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay in their own natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features for transmitting viruses, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
To better understand the life cycle of COVID and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is needed, which can be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, keeping animals away from the natural nutrient environment of the animal virus is the most effective way to prevent the animal virus.
These are still numerous missing pieces in the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2.
For the first time, if bats infected the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 virus into pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats have played a more direct role in human transmission, we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if third mammals really acted as intermediate nourishers, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and experimentally infected with the possibility that they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or other mammals, in the future, we'll identify SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestor virus in their natural food source.
Continued exploration in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is of crucial significance in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On 6th February 2020, our team published the Rapid Advisory Guidelines for Nuclear Treatment for the Diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and these guidelines have made a good reference for our fight against the pandemic in our country and around the world.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the current research findings and experience of medical practice, therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, a commentary is highlighted on our guidelines and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (seventh edition) "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" as provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment.
In December 2019, an outbreak was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice guides and they have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted a lot of attention.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, were published with some reference summaries modified.
Now our guidelines have received comment from Zhou et al., who have proposed a simple score based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also provided a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We commend and thank him for his remarkable work.
However, his work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (Testing 7th Edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case requires that any one item of epidemiological history characteristics be combined with two items of clinical discovery, or three items of clinical discovery if there is no clear epidemiological history.
Medical history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or in an area where COVID-19 cases have been reported for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the previous 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with areas with confirmed cases, (such as small areas such as home, office, school, classroom, etc., with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks and ≥ 2 cases).
Clinical innovation: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a typical characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a decreased total white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count, in the early onset phase.
Diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on suspected cases with any one of the following factors as further specified in the pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 must be positive; (2) a viral complete genetic sequence showing high similarity to the known novel coronavirus; (3) a serum test for SARS-CoV-2 positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or a change in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or a titer ≥4 times in the acute stage of recovery.
As we can see, real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers to identify the optimal nucleic acid for this rapid diagnosis, as well as the inclusion of a blood sample from a sample from the respiratory tract, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported positive results of specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there was increasing evidence that reminded us to be cautious with typical symptoms and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al. should update their flow chart, because they are classifying a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come up for the readers to comment on.
For diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we should follow and follow the latest guidelines of his home country.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to provide assistance.

Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: previously, curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Devine has extended his stay-at-home order through May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered its restrictions on toilet paper purchases to two and one package per transaction respectively nationally.
ALDI also, on Monday, started the one-pack limit.
These limits are posted as messages on the checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are stockpiling it over and over again for fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
The changes follow the previous four-pack per transaction restrictions introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 appearance, reported that the four-pack ban would be "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery", and said demand was "incredible", while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales "greatly increased" last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to increase inventory but were hampered by local council truck-delivery time restrictions.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers have to meet demand and at a lower rate of specials.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to early shipment of stock, some stores could not run Wednesday specials.
Reporting to News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores were filling up every night.
They complained that toilet paper is a big item, which leads to a shortage of stocks, and, when sold, it takes up a lot of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths show [that] if you have a lot of items on the shelf, like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and they are in greater numbers, you reduce the likelihood of panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a recycled toilet paper manufacturer, said it was out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply flowing.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at their auction, when some bids were made during the Labor Day big weekend because buyers had time.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, the daily printed in Darwin, eight water inserts were added to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, the store was originally opposed to the ban, stating that it had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that there is also a high demand for other products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-roll.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday as a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" is associated with the extent of a disease rather than the severity of a specific event, WHO has noted the need for concrete action by governments.
All countries can still change the currency of this pandemic.
If nations recognize this, they will respond by testing, treating, isolating, tracing and uniting their people in the fight, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are deeply concerned about both the dangerous level of spread and the seriousness and the frightening level of inaction.
Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the global pandemic "unprecedented".
"No other respiratory virus, other than influenza, has been traced from its origin to its global spread", he said in comments published on CNN in February.
Geberyesus expresses the same view, saying, "We have never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus before".
He added, "And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled in the same time".
The current global pandemic situation follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "It's certain that the situation will get worse".
As of Thursday, The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the global pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe acute respiratory syndrome.
The outbreak, which was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been classified as a pandemic since 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 3,64,000 people have recovered.
China has a death rate estimated at 4%, while Algeria is 13.04% and New Zealand is 0.08%.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and sweating.
In complicated cases, symptoms may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is known.
Primary care is symptomatic and baseline treatment.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing, social distancing, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closure of service facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe socio-economic isolation globally, sporting, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled and widespread shortages of supplies have been exacerbated by feared purchases.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are either nationally or locally closed, affecting nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other Eastern and Southeastern ethnic groups and people from areas that look like them and have significant cases of the virus.
The decrease in travel and closure of heavy industries has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to a wholesale seafood market in Hunan and therefore the virus is thought to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronaviruses, the fecal-cat coronavirus and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person with symptoms was later diagnosed on 1 December 2019, and the person was not directly related to the subsequent Weight Market Group.
Among the initial group of cases reported in 2019, two-thirds of cases were found to be market related.
An unverified report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that a 55-year-old man from Hubei province tracked as of 17 November 2019 may be the first case ever.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases were reported in China declining but suddenly increasing in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number in China for the first time.
Cases may have been reported at a much lower rate, especially those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, chief medical adviser to the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before mass immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive as per official guidelines.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had official policies not to test anyone with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were undetected and undocumented individuals with the infection were the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction count (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are cured.
And in those who don't, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, and most commonly 14 days.
As of 10th April 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been reported due to COVID-19.
As of 5 February, 80% of deaths in China were people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including heart disease and diabetes.Official death statistics from the COVID-19 pandemic usually relate to deaths that have tested positive for COVID under official guidelines.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who have not been tested, for example, dying at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The scant data from Italy suggests that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of deaths] is a low estimate", a statement that is confirmed by incomplete reports of a decrease in the U.S. count. Such a decrease in the count is frequent in pandemics, as was the case with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu.
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.
These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak and demographic characteristics; for example, age, gender and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University data, the global death-to-cases ratio as on 10th April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The ratio of deaths to cases in China decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms in 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
This data is not time-bound and it tracks a specific population from the time of infection until the case is solved.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
Based on evidence from the University of Oxford, the Centre for Medicine has estimated that the overall infection death rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper end of this range is consistent with the first randomized COVID-19 trials in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the effects of the trials on CFR.
WHO is confident that the pandemic can be brought under control.
The peak and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and can vary by location.
"If not tested, the outbreak stops growing at a level that is reduced when the available host for the disease is reduced", notes Penn State University's Massage Bonnie.
But it is simply impossible to predict when this will happen".
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that "it will be over by June" if all countries start following WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noted that SARS-CoV2 "is likely to spread for one to two years".
The study, led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, found that physical distancing and other measures "will be required until a vaccine is available (likely to take 18 months or more)".
"Since the virus is so easily transmitted, complete eradication is impossible", notes William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "so it will become a seasonal disease and will likely return every year".
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the collective immunity and extent of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively non-specific and are not likely to be present in infected people.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, cough, loss of smell, convulsions, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or a blue skin due to lack of oxygen. WHO states that about one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms; for example, difficulty breathing, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip bluing; and advises immediate medical attention if symptoms occur.
As some of those infected may not show symptoms, no medical symptoms are found but test results are positive, researchers have advised that those who have had close contact with people who are confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and monitored to rule out the possibility of infection.
The Chinese estimate that the proportion of asymptomatic can be as low as 44%.
The time from actual onset of illness (the time from infection to onset of symptoms) after the virus enters the body is usually between one and 14 days, usually five days.As an example of uncertainty, it is estimated that the number of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease may have spread are still being explored.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing or speaking, close contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that droplets can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) due to coughing without covering the mouth.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that can persist in the air for a long time, such as those that are released from the mouth when speaking.
These drops can be injected into the mouth or nose of people nearby, or they can be inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can allow airborne secretions to be sprayed in fine quantities and thus spread through the air.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although there is concern that it may spread through feces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted through feces or oral contact.Although it is possible that the virus is transmitted before symptoms appear and during the later stages of the disease, it is most likely to be transmitted in the first three days after symptoms appear.
People have tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that it is possible to become infected before the onset of symptoms.
There are few reports of asymptomatic but laboratory-confirmed cases, but when looking for contacts, some countries have found cases of asymptomatic infection.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states that although it is not fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus has been found to be present on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this can vary depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched, as well as washing your hands after contact with animals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated in Wuhan from three individuals with pneumonia linked to a group of cases of acute respiratory illness.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as its protective coating dissolves in household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genus forms a genetic cluster with two bat-derived variants, including the subgenus serbicovirus (lineage B) with the genus betacoronavirus.
It has a 96% homology at the whole genome level to other bat-related corona virus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between the genome sequence of the spider virus and that of the human virus in certain regions.
To date, 92% of the genomic material shared by the HCoV virus and SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in a complete genome comparison, which is insufficient to prove that HCoVs are the intermediate hosts.
Although the diagnosis of viral infection can be made on the basis of symptoms, it is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected practice.
Comparative studies of PCR and CT performed in Wuhan suggest that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR and many of its imaging characteristics are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has issued several guidelines for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results can usually be available in a matter of hours to days.
The test is usually performed with a sample of secretion from the upper part of the back of the nose but a sample of the throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing tests to detect blood-related resistance.
As of 6th April 2020, none of these tests had been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by CELACS in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Specific image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms include unproven peripheral ground glass opacities and no pleural fusion.
International online data on imaging findings of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Because of its association with infections such as adenovirus, using imaging to detect COVID-19 without PCR confirmation is less accurate.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that imaging, although less accurate for detecting infection, is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be considered as a screening tool in areas where the epidemic has spread.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence including radiography and CT have been developed to detect image characteristics of the virus.
The plans to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good overall personal health, washing hands, avoiding unwashed eyes, nose or mouth, using tissue when coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue directly in the trash, etc.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.Many governments have restricted or advised against travel from areas where the outbreak has been reported.
However, the virus has reached a social transmission stage in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some sections of the community are not aware of when and where they were infected. Healthcare providers who are caring for an infected person are advised to follow standard care, contact precautions and eye care.
The use of location information by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy and Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log a user's privacy-conscious proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about infection prevention, such as rinsing and rinsing are not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands appear dirty to the eyes, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
The reason is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap because household soap breaks its protective coating.
If soap and water are not readily available, the CDC still recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume.
WHO recommends not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
Several solvents such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can be used to remove surface contaminants (stainless steel surfaces can be sterilized using only one minute of disinfectant).
Other solvents such as benzalkonium and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a location such as a cafe or nursing home, all devices such as tablets, touch screens, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas should be disinfected.
Health agencies recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a folded lid or tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of droplets that are spread through the breath when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin, wearing a mask is likely to reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if hand hygiene is not good".
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at risk, for example those caring for COVID-19 infected people, while also acknowledging that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the wearing of masks among the general public.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric in the U.S. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks for public healthcare providers, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or without covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face masks when going to public places, to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going to grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March and passengers will be required to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when travelling outdoors and recommended that those who cannot afford face masks make masks at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at minimizing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The measures include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, grounds, theatres or shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, avoiding touching while greeting and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in the areas affected by the outbreak.
U.S. government agencies and health departments abruptly reduced the maximum number of people to gather from 250 people (unless the spread of COVID-19 in the province is known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two people from meeting in public places. Older people in places with a social outbreak and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, governance disorders, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems are advised by the CDC to stay at home as these individuals face an increased risk of serious illness and disorder.
The use of the term "social distancing" had the effect of encouraging people to isolate themselves completely in alternative ways rather than encouraging them to stay in social contact.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex with someone you live with who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected to have been infected are recommended to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have given proper guidance on how to self-isolate.Many governments have ordered or recommended the isolation of the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most stringent self-isolation guidelines have been issued for those in high risk groups.
People who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a high prevalence of the disease are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they came into contact.
Prevention or containment and mitigation are the key measures to control the outbreak.
Prevention of spread is done at the early stage of the outbreak and aims to track, isolate those who are infected, as well as plan infection control measures and vaccinate to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.
When the spread of disease cannot be prevented, steps are taken towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and measures are taken to reduce the impact on health system and society.
Both prevention and mitigation can be combined.
To contain the spread, more drastic measures are needed, such as reducing the number of reproductive baseline to less than 1 and reversing the global pandemic. As part of infectious disease planning, efforts are made to reduce the severity of the spread, which is called flattening the spread graph.
This reduces the risk of stress on healthcare and allows time for developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical precautions that can manage the outbreak may include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-isolation, closing schools, banning large gatherings, encouraging and involving the community to accept interventions, as well as social measures aimed at physical distancing, as well as personal preventive measures such as cleaning surfaces related to the surrounding environment.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and local quarantine and warned against the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who isolated themselves and punished those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and punished medical stockpiling.Following Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in mitigating (not stopping, but slowing down the spread of the pandemic) and preventing (reversing the spread of the pandemic).
While favourable plans to reduce the spread of disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by two thirds and halve deaths, it can still cause thousands of deaths and put a huge strain on health systems.
Preventing or suppressing transmission may be a priority but it needs to be maintained continuously as long as the virus is circulating in the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), otherwise infection will re-emerge rapidly after measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to prevent or contain the spread of the pandemic have caused economic and social losses.
There are no specific antiviral medicines for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them, which includes testing of available medicines.
Taking cold medicines readily available at the pharmacy, drinking fluids, and getting enough rest can help reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be felt as an acute need.
Steroid use can make the effects worse.
Several compounds that have been previously approved to treat other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has said that capacity building and healthcare optimization for COVID-19 patients are the basic measures to respond to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines to scale up the resources available to hospitals and primary healthcare including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating alternative methods where possible, isolating and quarantining patients who test positive for COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds, etc.
There are several theories about where the first case (so-called patient number zero) was found.
The first case of this novel coronavirus can be traced back to Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
They were mostly connected to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals, or in other words, it is an animal origin of the virus. A group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were found on December 26 and treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jishian, who told Wuhan Jianjian CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the "SARS-Tatsum coronavirus".
Eight of them, including Li Wenling, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Mother Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for making such a warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed WHO.
A number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which led to an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was estimated to double every seven and a half days.
The virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020 due to migration caused by the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major railway switching point or junction.
China reported nearly 140 cases in a single day on January 20, with two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had pre-existing symptoms.As of 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the world in terms of the highest number of confirmed cases.As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least one case has been reported in nearly 200 countries and territories.
Due to the global pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and controlled borders.
Nationwide responses include containment measures (stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders and curfews) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, over 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion in two days - a figure that is one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan before 1 December 2019, with an unconfirmed case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jishian had a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of samples from patients on 27 December showed the presence of SARS-like coronaviruses.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to the public.
WHO was informed on the same day.
As the alert was made, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about spreading false rumors about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
The sanitary chain, described as "the largest isolation in human history", was announced on January 23, halting travel in and out of Wuhan, which was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital called Hushenshan Hospital which was completed in 10 days.
To accommodate the increased number of patients, another hospital, the Lichenchen Hospital, was built.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China converted other places in Wuhan such as conference centers and buildings such as sports grounds into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including health declarations for travellers and extended spring holidays.
Universities and schools in the country were closed.
Several measures were taken in the Hong Kong and Macau region, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work arrangements were implemented in many parts of China.
Restrictions were imposed on travel within and outside Hubei.

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a number of incidents including shortages of supplies, which are generated by increased use of epidemic control equipment globally, panic purchases and disruption to factory and transportation.
The United States Food and Drug Administration warned of shortages of drugs and medical supplies as consumer demand increased and suppliers were disrupted.
In many areas, panic buying was seen and as a result, essential groceries like food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the fruit of the shops, leading to shortages of supplies.
The mainly tech industries have been warned about the delay in shipment of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.

This has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO has warned could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the global pandemic has given Daigu shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan area and the high demand for upcoming food items, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to curb stockpiling and smuggling of essential goods have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant decline in agricultural output but industry representatives say prices may rise.
The empty food bars in shops were also only temporary in Wuhan, while Chinese authorities opened up pork stocks to adequately feed the population.

The global pandemic has profoundly affected the performing arts and cultural traditions, and has affected institutions and individuals - both employed and unemployed - globally.
The arts and culture sector organizations tried to continue their campaigns (mostly publicly funded) which included giving the community the opportunity to experience cultural traditions, keeping their employees safe in public places and helping artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, a number of museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions across the world have been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and performances have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, a major effort was made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, which are currently being shut down in a more rapid fashion due to the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other musical events and social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption as the Vatican announced that it has canceled the observance of the religious week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian season of Lent.
Many diocesan jurisdictions have asked senior Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday prayers, some churches have made church services available via radio, online live broadcasts or television while some churches are offering a drive-in option.
Other religious institutions have also suspended services and restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras as the Roman Catholic bishops' territory closes their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square is being emptied of pilgrims.
Iran's Health Ministry cancelled Friday prayers in the outbreak zone and closed after the mass, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused major disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Several major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but will be before the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have closed and live poker matches have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers playing online, which has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups to many online gambling sites. Many musical groups have postponed or cancelled concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
Many major theatres like Broadway have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to continue creating and sharing art on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live performance of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and publicize their work.
Many online internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have spread, many of which serve to create humor and distract in this climate of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia, deep prejudice and racism have been manifested against Chinese people and people from the East Asian region as well as hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
In particular, many countries in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region have reported cases of fear, suspicion and hostility.
The report in February (when most cases were still confined to China) made racially motivated entries in various groups around the world that the Chinese people were deserving of the virus outbreak or were receiving what was reported as a just retaliation.
Anti-China sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many citizens of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on regional origin.
Support is available for Chinese people and people in the affected areas both online and offline.
People in Italy, the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries, may have also been subjected to suspicion and xenophobia.People from other countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially joined together to sign petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontKnowJapan has also been a hot topic on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in the UK and the US have reported increasing incidents of racism and assault.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students from North East India, who come from China border areas and study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, state president of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them".
The Chinese Embassy in Kolkata later condemned the claims, calling them "flawed".Xenophobia and racism against non-residents of China in China have been fueled by the epidemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Current mailers with paywalls have removed some or all of their paywalls for their coronavirus briefing.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific research on the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on a preprint server such as bioRxiv.
Emerging infectious disease - an infectious disease of emerging pathogens, often with an unpredictable outbreak range or mode of transmission.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and detect the antibiotics produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is unique and is designed to detect only RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to determine the most recent or active infection.
Antimicrobial testing (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and close monitoring of the population.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very mild symptoms or people without symptoms, to name a few.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and immunity level of a population group.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in their population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This variability is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription can be tested on respiratory samples obtained by various methods using polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), including nasopharyngeal swabs or spit samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test of throat spit is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and continue to grow rapidly in the lungs.
Alternatively, a sample can be taken from deep airways via a suction catheter or a post-cough component (drop) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed at Charity in Berlin in January 2020 and was the foundation of 250,000 test kits made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England had also developed a test by 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Cogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (Powercheck Coronavirus).
The test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.BIG Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector kit in China.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel through International Regent Resources.
One in three genetic test defects in older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results and hampered testing at the CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, two-component tests were not considered valid, and until then, state level and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization.Trials were initiated by commercial laboratories in the United States in early March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No quantity limit was declared; sample collection and processing should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and produced by Vector, the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Healthcare Monitoring. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test on Abbott's M2000 system; such authorization had previously been granted by the FDA to Hologic, LabCorp and ThermoFisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Sefeid received similar EUA from the FDA for a trial that would take approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the method can give definite results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 such devices in the United States and Abbott expects to scale up production to 50,000 tests per day.A test using monoclonal antibiotics that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation that the test will produce results similar to the rapid influenza test in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 review of the information concluded that "chest X-rays are less useful for early-stage diagnosis, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms begin".
Typical features of CT include a peripheral heterogeneous lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan, the current epicenter of the outbreak, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less characteristic as it incorporates many of its imaging features with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a priority first-line test for the detection or diagnosis of COVID-19".
The production of antibodies including IgM and IgG is part of the immune response to infection.
The tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population after approximately 7 days of onset of symptoms or by point of care testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will have large scale automated systems that can perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the cost of production for each system.
Although multiple samples can be used to track immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction is required prior to screening.On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 ingredients that have been recommended to the agency as needed and are therefore able to distribute their antibiotic assays.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization.At the end of March 2020, EuroImmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the background of the virus in a blood sample.
The test is so powerful that hundreds of samples can be tested in a matter of hours and hence the test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibiotics are usually detectable within 14 days of infection.In early April, England was found to have no antibody test kits that were suitable enough to use.
Hong Kong has a plan in place where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", spit in it, send it back and get the test results in a short time.The British NHS has announced that it is studying a plan to test suspects at home, so that they do not risk infecting others if they arrive at the hospital or need to disinfect an ambulance if they are used.Healthcare professionals should take the appropriate precautions when testing for COVID-19 for suspected individuals.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians reported on 2 March that they had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day in a mobile system, up from 10,700 tests in the previous week.
When a doctor orders a test, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
Up to March 19, the drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first survey in the laboratory found that a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 up to and including the calendar week of 12/2020.Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and used a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, in which all samples were pooled and only tested further if a positive sample was found.On 5 February 2020, BI opened a fourth emergency laboratory in Wuhan called "O-Yan" (Chinese: 艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾艾
The construction was completed in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modelling shows that had this testing capacity not been started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the associated cost of quarantine handling would have doubled.
The Wuhan laboratory has been followed up by Huoyun laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, the total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day.The open source multiplex design, published by Origami Essays, can screen up to 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
As of March, shortages and insufficient reagents have been a barrier to large-scale trials in the EU, UK and US.
This led some authors to experiment with a sample preparation protocol that involved heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people for coronavirus in its population than any other country and was on track to raise testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive through capabilities and purchasing of a population-scale wholesale throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large scale operation outside China.
Various testing activities targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO adopted Germany's action to send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits.
Germany's action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed available tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits in the early days of the outbreak and these countries and Australia could not supply enough kits to meet testing recommendations from demand and health experts.
On the contrary, the availability of large numbers of tests in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The large scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories was built up by the South Korean administration over a period of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization ordered an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The large spread of the virus led to a surplus of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing.Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but the results were found to be incorrect.
The company explained that failure to collect samples or use the kit properly may have led to incorrect results.
The Spanish Ministry said it would return the kits with incorrect results and instead provide a separate test kit supplied by Shenzhen Bioice.The Czech Republic provided 80% of the test kits purchased from China with incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test kits from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kits be disposed of at the Danube. Ates Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the kits purchased by Turkey from China had "a high degree of defects" and were "not used". The UK purchased 35 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing, followed by isolation of test positive patients and tracking of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive people, yielded good results.
Researchers working in the Italian city where the first death from COVID-19 occurred in Italy conducted two rounds of testing on an estimated 3,400 people, with an interval of approximately ten days.
About half of the positive cases had no symptoms and those who were found were isolated.
By restricting travel in social life, the new infection was completely avoided.
With aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries and restaurants and retail establishments have not had to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closures.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay home from 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March at the scheduled time after the holiday period.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, domestic travel bans, testing and quarantines, but also through less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with higher testing than death rates have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have only detected mild or no symptoms.
WHO has recommended that countries which do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO-referenced laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 laboratories mentioned, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following table shows the impact of the country's testing policy on the "Percentage of Positive Tests" range.
Otherwise, the positive rate will be higher in a country that tests only hospitalized people, as compared to a country that tests all citizens, with or without symptoms.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also called hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands with the intention of removing dirt, lubricants, microorganisms, or other unwanted elements.
Regular hand washing at certain "critical times" throughout the day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and plaque, which are spread by hand contact with the mouth.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membrane).
The five most important times of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating and cooking food and after or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
And if soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with soap, the World Health Organization recommends washing your hands at the following times:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or washing a kid's butt after a bath.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene is the hygiene habits associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or receiving medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
And that includes reducing the infant mortality rate for home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices can lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood deaths associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by about one third and is comparable to providing clean water to low income groups.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence can be attributed to handwashing with soap.The practice of handwashing with soap, which is practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only very effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, the major ARI, is a leading cause of death in children under five years of age, killing an estimated 18 lakh children every year.
It is estimated that 35 lakh children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, the built-in habit of washing hands with soap before and after eating and using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against the infection of the infectious disease of the firefly, also known as impetigo, which is spread through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause dry skin and skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that too much hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as hand itching, scarring, and a skin condition called hand ulcer, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much frequent hand washing is also considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times of the day when hands are exposed to the mouth and mouth to reduce the spread of disease: after going to the bathroom (urine, toilet), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing procedures should be followed to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating a cut or other wound; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is not as common.
A 2015 study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rate at 95%, the United States at about 77%, and China at 23%. Some changing practices are now showing signs of increasing soap-washing practices at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measuring action to improve children's health and education.
In addition, disinfecting the hands with soap twice a year, brushing the teeth with fluoride, is a core part of the national programme.
This has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because the fats and proteins that are the organic soil components are not immediately soluble in water.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water.
Due to its recycling nature, solid soap is likely to contain bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria through infected solid soap concluded that the bacteria are unlikely to migrate as the foam destroys them.
The CDC still recommends "non-touchable liquid soap is preferred for use".
Antibiotic soap has been heavily promoted among health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for natural antibiotic-resistant.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic ingredients such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resistant strains of bacteria.
Therefore, antibiotic stress inhibitors may not be as effective as suggested, even if they are not chosen for disinfectant soaps.
In addition to the active ingredients and skin-protective agents, sophisticated formulations such as pH regulators may contain acids (acetic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), immunoactive benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (currant, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as consumer-grade triclosan in preventing and removing germs from surfaces as insecticide soaps today.
Hot water, which is comfortable for hand washing, is not enough to kill germs.
Germs grow rapidly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
However, warm water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing dirt and germs from natural oil.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of them are in gel form with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation, or in a moist liquid such as glycerin, or in foam form to reduce the drying effect of alcohol and easy to use.
The mild hydrogen peroxide enhances the antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of the alcohol in hand sanitizer is an effective disinfectant.
Alcohol rub kills sanitizer bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some germs (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% (a 3.5 log reduction equivalent to a 35 decibel reduction) of germs on hands within 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reductions) within 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizer is very effective on some germs and less effective on some germs.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to thoroughly clean both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the space between all fingers with liquid, foam or gel until dry for about 30 seconds.
Wash your fingertips and rub them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you rub your hands with hand sanitizer after washing them when they are dirty.
The use of these agents is increasing due to their ease of use and fast antimicrobial action, however, they should not serve as a substitute for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol based sanitizer can dry out the skin with frequent use, so it should be softened and/or moisturized.
The desiccant effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners to this formula.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients in clinical trials have been shown to reduce skin inflammation and dryness compared to soap or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact gallbladder syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or substances in hand rubs are rare.
The lower incidence of irritant contact causing skin disease was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens because pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and formulation and has historically significantly outpaced alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown continuous and stored antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where efficiency was found to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low income groups cannot afford soap and use ashes and dirt.
And ashtrays may be more effective than just water, but they're less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, soil is a disinfectant because when it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends that when soap is not available, ash or sand should be used as an alternative.
The correct hand washing practices recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with hot or running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins can be contaminated, and water temperature was found to make little difference.
Make a foam of it by applying plenty of soap, rubbing on your hands, rubbing on the back of your hands, between your fingers, under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using plain water.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer will cause more germs to be removed.
Wash your hands under running water.
Washing hands in a basin can re-contaminate hands.
Wipe your hands with a clean cloth or allow them to air dry.
Wet and wet hands are easily re-contaminated. Thumbs, wrists, between the fingers, and under the fingernails are the most common areas to be flushed when washing hands.
Fingerprints and partially removed nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing in places where tap water and/or soap is not available e.g. in developing countries, if necessary, pouring water and/or ash from hanging jericho or pumpkin with appropriate holes. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation options such as "tippi taps" and other low cost options.
Tip-tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with a rope and a lever that can be moved with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hand and soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in most washrooms.
A study was conducted in 2008 by the University of Westminster London and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194 percent and the number on the palms by 254 percent.
After drying with a jet air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42 percent and the number on the bottom by 15 percent.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the number on the palms by 77%. Scientists conducted tests to see if each type of drying method was likely to contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment.
The jet air dryer, which expels air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and unit and contaminating the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 m away.
Using a hot air dryer, microbes can spread up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No significant spread was observed due to paper towels. A study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated different hand-turning patterns.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
On the road, when soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer wipes are an alternative to hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study showed that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds long, involving using a large amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rubbing each part of the hand.
Hands should be clasped together and rubbed together.
If dirt is stuck in the nails, bristle brushes can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash hands and wipe with a clean cloth as water on the hands can contain germs.
After drying, use a paper towel to shut off the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This prevents the hand from getting contaminated again by the surfaces.
In healthcare, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microbes ("germs") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains unacceptable in many medical settings, where a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and this leads to bacterial infections.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple practices can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a booklet on hand washing and hand washing in healthcare.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization can also be found on their website for public comment.
Whitby and others had compiled a relevant review.
Where regular compliance demonstration is required, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The WHO has five "moments" for hand washing:
If you come in contact with blood/body fluids.
Before the disinfection work, and
After the patient has been cared for. If soap contains antiseptic chemicals ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap), the hand washing fluid will have a deadly effect.
Such killings may be required before surgery or in areas with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as a hand-washing tube that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a disinfected towel to dry hands after washing, a disinfected brush to rub and another disinfectant for under-nail hygiene.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the area from the hand and wrist to the corner for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take much time (10 minutes) to scrub.
When washing with a washcloth, avoid water from the wrist to the ankle back and forth to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and surgical gown is applied to the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing was obtained from the first 20% of washing and a very slight increase was obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Handwashing with plain soap is three times more likely to spread bacteria into food than with antibacterial soap. A comparison of handwashing with alcohol-based solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap, for example, for 30 seconds at a time, showed that handwashing with alcohol-based solution reduced bacterial infection by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from hard germ cells. Interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings may include training employees on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and providing written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and necessary means of achieving good health and nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made achieving universal hand washing behaviour a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, despite affordable options for installing handwashing facilities, there is a shortage of handwashing faucets near every private or public toilet.
However, low hand washing can be a result of a more entrenched habit than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and reward of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and change long-term behaviour of the population.
To implement it effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in LMICs, while social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encourages schools to implement simple, affordable solutions to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars.
The creation of hand washing facilities can be part of the initiative to promote hand washing to reduce morbidity and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. UNICEF campaigned for the adoption of handwashing emoji in 2019-20 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided dailies.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly cheaper than with water and other sanitation interventions.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations - such as new mothers giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - the importance of hand washing for human health was first recognized by two pioneers working on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "English founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miamas.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively promoted handwashing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 Swine Flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, graffiti showing "proper hand washing practices" were placed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and toilets at airports.
Washing one's hands is a phrase that refers to a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or share the complexities of it.
It originates from a Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands over his decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but in some English-speaking societies the phrase came into more widespread use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash herself in an attempt to wash away the fictional stain while demonstrating her guilty conscience for the crimes she committed and had her husband commit.
It has also been found that when people think or think about immoral acts, they wash their hands more often than others and tend to place more emphasis on handwashing equipment.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other activities that compensate for the "sanity" such as volunteering.
Using water to wash hands, but not soap to wash hands symbolically, is part of hand washing rituals, which include those of the Baha'i, Hindu, Tevilah and Netaila in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 workplace hazard management
Occupational hazard control due to COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health practices to control the risks for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and nature of work, which depends on the source of infection, the severity of illness in the community and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations involve minimal occupational contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace hygiene and disinfection.
Moderate risk occupations include those that require upper or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may have been infected due to ongoing community infection or international travel.
This includes workers who are exposed to the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control for this group includes maintaining ventilation using high-performance air filters, use of sneezing guards and having personal protective equipment available if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHO considers healthcare workers and morgue workers who have come into contact with a known or suspected person with COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, in which case the worker is performing a process that produces aerosols or collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19, which increases the risk of exposure to a very high level.
The risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the specific job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns can change in both the sense of what goods are in demand and the way in which those goods are procured (such as buying when there is less crowding or buying through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, the movement of goods from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The level plans address the various workplace and work-related risks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors and risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise from outbreaks.
Preparedness and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Goals for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission amongst staff, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business practices and minimizing adverse impacts on other things in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the communities where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk controls widely used in occupational safety and health is a framework for grouping risk controls by their effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to work policies or processes that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, fit for use (e.g. respirators) and worn properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary and removed, cleaned and stored properly or disposed of properly to prevent infection.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), occupations with low infection risk have minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplace, including thorough and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, observing respiratory etiquette including covering their face when coughing and sneezing, providing buckets for disposing of tissue paper and garbage, being prepared to prepare telecommunications or various shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
The early identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who develop symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home for at least 24 hours unless they have a fever, fever symptoms, or other symptoms without taking any other medications that reduce fever or modify symptoms, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for their sick family member and keeping employees informed of those policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk occupations include jobs that require close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business area or recent international travel to a location with a high prevalence of COVID-19.
These include the need to install high-performance air filters in engineering controls for and for high-risk groups, increase the need to keep air circulating, require physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing guards and install a drive-through window or a syringe for customer services, which may include the need to install a mask or a hand sanitizer for the workplace, provide a virtual workstation for the workers, a platform for the public to interact with the workers, and develop and implement a personal protective environment, training and training for workers who need to work in COVID-19 and other workplace issues, including the introduction of COVID-19 prevention measures, the introduction of a safe working environment, and the introduction of a safe workplace.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person and providing a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
Disposable medical gloves should be worn when serving an ill passenger or touching his bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces and cabin crew should wear additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag and then the infected area cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel while ill and self-isolation if fever or other symptoms are present while on board and promptly notifying the medical centre on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be in the quarantined person's room.If an infected person is found in a school or childcare facility, the CDC recommends temporarily closing it for hygiene and disinfection, regardless of whether there is community transmission.
Where there is at least moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as postponing field trips, crowds and other large gatherings including physical education or prayer classes or dining outs in restaurants, increasing distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors and setting up separate health centre sites for children with flu-like symptoms.
School closures may be considered for longer periods of time when there is significant infection in the local community, with social distancing strategies.Law enforcement personnel who are doing their normal daily activities are considered by the CDC to be at a lower immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who are required to have contact with other persons who are infected or suspected of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the guidelines with appropriate personal protective equipment, as are emergency medical technicians.
In case of close contact during the care period, employees should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear with household cleaning spray or wipes before re-use and follow standard operating procedures for disposal of used PPE, separation of clothing and washing for a controlled period.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk of infection.
High risk occupations include healthcare delivery, relief, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If the personnel are performing aerosol-producing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at extremely high risk of infection.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental systems and examination or invasive sampling.
High risk morgue work includes personnel involved in preparing the bodies of persons with known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of death, who are at high risk of infection if they perform autopsies. These risk groups include quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including carrying out aerosol manufacturing process in additional engineering controls.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary structures.
Handling of samples with biosecurity level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients suspected of COVID-19 be isolated in separate waiting rooms.Along with other PPE, OSHA recommends that employees working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and performing aerosol-production processes be allowed to use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and make employees more comfortable.WHO does not recommend protecting the whole body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, it does not spread through other body secretions.
WHO recommends that only personnel inspecting entry points wear surgical masks.
For personnel collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 without any aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves.
If aerosol-producing procedure is performed, N95 or FFP2 respirator should be used instead of surgical mask.
Due to the global supply of PPE being insufficient, the WHO recommends that physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows allow direct access to healthcare providers in the COVID-19 patient room using only the PPE needed for specific work, reducing the need for PPE use for them, using a single respiratory mask without side-effects when serving multiple patients with identical diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain and not encouraging the use of masks for those without attention.

Date/time of release: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a significant situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that has made clear the interconnectedness of global humanity and our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no precedent for this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation and community building at the heart of our organization.
A remarkable testament to how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with amazing people is the kindness and care that is evident among all our colleagues through email, phone and chat.
I could not be more grateful and proud to call you my colleagues.
Last week, someone complimented me on your work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to read Wikipedia at this time and how powerful a symbol it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
Whether you're keeping this site up to date or paying our colleagues or keeping your community safe, it's all because of your work.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, much more than Ervi does.
This is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it is going to have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will make some significant changes in the way we work together starting next week.
The Bible says: "The one who is good at his work will be blessed".
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what would be the right response to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the institution in this time.
We are eager to relieve stress and help our mission in the long run.
If you want to dial back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract staff:
Our daily work schedule is expected to be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used in this campaign.
But the world is unpredictable at the moment and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don't have to say it, but we're saying it.
No need for sick leave or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team adjust the calendar and schedule so that the important parts of the job can be done.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by management.)
Full pay will be given to employees who work overtime.
We have already said and reiterate our commitment to respect our commitment to our contractors and our colleagues who work overtime.
Each will be paid according to his normal hours of work.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress about the world around them.
Especially in times like this, what we do can have incredible benefits.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our demand is that you communicate with your managers so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things that we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) perform important tasks which may require additional assistance.
We will start the process with all departments to assess the current targets and focus on supporting the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of us, let us focus only on the most important projects.
If you work slowly now, you will not lose later.
Once this pandemic is over, we have no plans to "work twice as long to get the job done".
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and timetables when appropriate.
What is APP?
While adjusting our new realistic and daily expectations for working hours, we intend to adjust the deadline for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose to extend our 2019-2020 plan to include those who may have more time to budget for prioritizing critical tasks, self-care and care of their loved ones, who may need to work in the next few weeks or who may wish to work for shorter periods.
This extension of time frame will significantly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will update our delegates and teams on the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this.
Office presence, infection and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our SF-area employees was likely infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have deployed a disinfecting cleaning team to disinfect all areas in our San Francisco offices.
They use the highest quality disinfectant used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the edges of the elevator that comes to our floor.
The building uses its own safety measures, using products that help the safety of its tenants.
We are satisfied that when we decide to return, these offices will be fully operational.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork areas, where they have shared their COVID-19 measures with us and all other DC-area employees.
Last week, our DC office was converted to a fully remote setup following guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-area know, we're in talks to lease a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but we may be late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Long-time remote workers know that this will be just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit your meetings to one or two hours at the most.
If you need longer sessions, think about how you can divide them into several days.
Make the meeting agenda clear and send them the materials in advance.
Make this video the default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect.
To make each meeting easier, have someone lead it, who will monitor the chat for questions asked and check the list of speakers, and have someone else help you take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a convenient headset, email tech support.
Use your welfare payments for breakfast.
Join the #RemoteIs channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about your task.
The HR Operations Team is looking at webinar based ergonomics to help the growth of work that has been distributed across the organisation.
Last week, we asked all community donors to postpone Wikimedia-sponsored public events like "Editathon" until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we were aware that our request for suspension and other restrictions would make it impossible to complete their agreed subsidy activities, and also that no one would be punished for this delay and change that target.
Next week we will be tracking additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community meetings.
A common feeling in the global community seems to be both sadness about this disruption and joy at this clarity and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a place for the community to monitor this impact and track our communications with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will be sending out invitations to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We're going to use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you should keep receiving information via this email and other important information about COVID-19 on Office-Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or challenges under consideration, or need help with anything else, do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to help and cooperate and to establish contacts if necessary.
If you have any sensitive or confidential material, please email Brian Judan, Director of Global Human Resources.
None of these changes should be seen as a renunciation of our work and a constraint.
Instead, they are a formal acknowledgement that at this moment we will need to take on our work and responsibilities in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to cooperate with each other, so that we can continue to work, to meet their needs and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, these planned activities will help us.
For now, it is time to cooperate with each other and make room for important work that will be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so you need to take care of yourself and your family so that you can give your best when needed.
Now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following are the key leadership team members (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.) and the remaining leadership team members (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Jenine U., Liza S., Robin A. Ryan M., and Toby N.).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ((ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell sheath) of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing the level of Ang (((1-7) it inhibits the action of ACE2 related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and is therefore a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses to enter cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloprotein found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectorin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type mucosal skin protein that is activated by its enzyme activity on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from a second transmembrane called shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is present in almost all organs: the membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in arteries and veins, and smooth muscle in arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistant to ACE.
ACE gives the hormone angiotensin I access to the vascoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down the carboxylic-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), also known as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
[des-Arg9]-ACE2 can break down many other peptides including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in heart failure.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63;SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells by SARS-CoV and the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes located in cells.
The entry process also requires the host serine protease TMPRSS2 to priming the S protein, which inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential treatment.This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, patients who were at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure, had a reduced risk of stroke when treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia, ACE use was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemo dynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours and its effect takes 30 minutes to start and its effect (duration) is 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with high levels of imbalance angiotensin.
b-COVID-19 Apps are software applications on mobile devices, designed to help in contact management in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person who has been in contact with an infected person ("contact").
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks were developed to create contact tracing apps.
There have been concerns about privacy, especially in systems that track the geolocation of app users.
Less unwanted options include using a blue tooth signal to log a user's interactions with other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such BlueTooth based apps will be integrated to support the functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has made available an app that will allow citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.
The app is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, the app is called Trace Together.
The app was developed by a local IT community and made available as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched the Blue Tooth based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The Government said on 12 April 2020 that the app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks.A similar app is planned in Ireland and France ("Stop COVID").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow, do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists several potential practical problems with APR-based systems, including false positives and the low probability of effectiveness if APR use is limited to a very small percentage of the population.
Expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, limiting it to only "authorized" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed serious concerns regarding the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially whether it would destroy the surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The agencies announced eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and standardised";
Extension of surveillance and surveillance would have to include sunset clauses;
Data use should be limited for COVID-19 reasons;
Information security and anonymity must be ensured and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
Digital surveillance is essential to prevent extreme discrimination and neglect;
Sharing information with third parties should be defined in law;
The right of citizens to protect against and respond to abuse;
Meaningful involvement of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required.Checklists have also been issued by the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of permanently removing tracking devices from their operating systems once the need for tracking systems is over.
Some countries use network based location tracking instead of apps which eliminates the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
Network-based tracking was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; many privacy protected systems have been created that use only a central server for intercommunication.
In South Korea, we used a system that was not based on the app to introduce contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system combined various tracking information including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined it to create notifications via text message to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert against potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed, due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
The information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites, and other countries including Germany have considered both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released as on 6th April 2020.
- Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort with both centralized and decentralized approaches and no single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mobile to contact tracking mechanism (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matching data remains on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform for using privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or path intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research published in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic". Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a privacy technology developer created by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure data hardware technology to allow the user to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
The Global TCN Alliance was formed on 5th April 2020 by groups that were basically united around the same approach and mostly overlapping protocols and aim to reduce fragmentation, mitigate and enable the effectiveness of alerting apps, which is a key aspect of the broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will maintain privacy.
He also highlighted the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be broken down into three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create government privacy - Rollout of Corona Virus Tracing Apps to protect.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS, Android, Google and Apple is planned to address continuous monitoring issues by first deploying the system through operating system updates and then removing the threat in the same way after the threat is avoided.
B'drug repositioning (also called drug re-positioning, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug originally approved for one disease or disorder to treat another disease.
This is the only scientific research of its kind that is currently being conducted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infection for vaccines and revaccination. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 dragable proteins, each with multiple associated binding sites.
Analysis of such binding sites provides the opportunity to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papane-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphateases.
Hussain A.A. and others studied various candidate compounds and then analyzed them for similarity in form to the same approved drug, which would allow them to develop an anti-SARS-CoV-2 enhancer in their preclinical studies and recommend it in clinical study frameworks.
Chloroquine is an anti-cold medication used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the four drugs that will be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial will include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved through the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorised under the EIA for experimental treatment only for patients who are admitted to hospital but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial.
The CDC states that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been standardized.
The drug is recommended by doctors when "there is no other option".
A small study conducted by the Turkish Research Team in Istanbul is using chloroquine with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
There are many studies being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure is being tested by NYU Langon Medical School.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipirvir is "fully effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in 4 days while 45 patients who did not receive it had a sickness duration of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipirvir and half received umiphenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminded the public that the current evidence available to support the drug is insufficient and primitive.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stockpile, and with the help of the military, distribute it to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe held formal talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe illness because the virus has already multiplied there.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra) that combined the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir concluded that "no benefit was seen".
Drugs were developed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is working to improve these drugs to find compounds that bind to the proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed and marketed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir exhibited anti-phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxovir-, and coronavirus-like endogenous anti-viral activity.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance from mutations that results in more serious illness and infection.
Some previous pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high gene resistance for resistance.Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and one for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization are ongoing; two placebo-controlled ((China, Canada) and one uncontrolled ((Italy).

See also trials in China and Italy and Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID 19 vaccine is a fictional vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said at the end of February 2020 that an anti-virus vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, is not expected to be available for 18 months.
In April, Phase I safety study was underway on five vaccine candidates.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The global outbreak in 2020 led to massive investments and research in vaccine development.
Several organizations are using the published genome to develop a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
The key elements of the CEPI initiative to develop a vaccine as announced in April are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists were informed that R&D on 10 different technology platforms was underway in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives of the Prabhasta I Security Study are:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Project I) Developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Project I developer and vaccine candidate:Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to information received by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the pre-development stage, with 78 projects confirmed to be underway (79 according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced with very little information made public (assumed to be planned or under development).
Phase I-II trials are primarily concerned with safety and antigenicity and are usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multiple sites to determine the most accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials usually involve more subjects, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, and monitor for side effects after adequate doses are administered.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still undergoing "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring a potential molecular clamp vaccine that would induce an immune response by genetically modifying viral proteins.

In Italy on 17 March 2020, Tacis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will receive results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the final vaccine candidate will follow.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Prepardiness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 to the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Assistance Team, bringing CEPI's total investment to US$29 to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 with the support of Institut Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
CEPI's investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
Russian health authorities announced on 20 March 2020 that scientists have started animal trials of six different vaccine candidates.
On 20 March 2020, researchers at Imperial College London announced that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving the order from China.
The Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 projects on medical treatment against COVID-19 at the end of March, which included various vaccine candidates from companies and universities across Canada, such as Medicaid and Saskatchewan Initiative.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million to develop a vaccine specifically for COVID-19, including plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" to be used in the event of a re-epidemic.
On 2 April 2020, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that it was testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine, Pitkovak, in mice, informing that "an effective antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine given by MNA was tested with a dose that started to be obtained 2 weeks after vaccination".
The University of Waterloo School of Medicine in Canada announced on 16 April 2020 that it plans to develop a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a fountain of inoculation.
DNA will be created using a bactericidal agent that will replicate in the human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which will stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, along with Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the United Nations government, industry and three universities all used the combined resources to access IBM's supercomputer.
Some vaccines have unusual effects, which can also be called unintended effects.
This means that there may be benefits beyond treating the disease.
In the future, 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccines being developed are likely to be unsafe or ineffective.
Previous research to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates suggests the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity-level 3 control measures and standardized safety procedures for handling live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no cure for SARS or vaccine that is both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations worldwide.
When MERS became more prevalent, it was believed that ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful template for finding a vaccine and a cure for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a Phase I clinical trial of a single (DNA-based) MERS vaccine in humans had been completed, and work was underway on three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media posts have sparked a conspiracy discussion that the virus responsible for COVID-19 is known and a vaccine against it is already available.
The patents that have emerged as evidence from various posts on social media refer to existing patents for the genetic sequence of other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus and vaccines.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Fever, cough and shortness of breath are common symptoms.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, sore throat, bad breath, and stomach pain.
The period of onset of symptoms from obstruction is usually five days but can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, while some patients progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, out of which 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 cases have been reported from the disease, which is mainly transmitted through direct contact between people, often through cough, sneezing or passing saliva through the mouth.
When you breathe out, these ice particles are expelled and fall to the ground or surface, they don't carry infection very far.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on any surface for 72 hours.
It is highly contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, but can spread in pre- and post-symptomatic stages.Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal fluid is a standardised diagnostic method.
People suspected of having the virus and those who provide care to them are advised to wear masks.
The general public has been given different advice regarding wearing masks, some officials are against wearing masks, some recommend wearing masks and some say wearing masks is necessary.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
The majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
Patients with viral infection sometimes have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Sudden symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or tightness, feeling dizzy, difficulty walking and blue face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
Some patients had moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some patients in China initially developed symptoms of chest tightness and heart palpitations.
Some patients have reported progression to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some individuals it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed symptoms appeared within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in infection is not yet clear; however, from initial evidence, they are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.
The incidence of asymptomatic cases is still unknown and is being studied, while the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic until the patient was admitted to hospital.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic patients in the daily patient count from 1 April; of the 166 infected patients reported that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of screening.
Both spit and saliva carry a large viral load.
Loud speech releases more mucus than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a person can cough up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) without covering his mouth.
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it is likely to be a bioaerosol transmission and positive viral RNA has been detected in samples taken from outdoor gas collectors of people.
During certain medical procedures, such as tubal ligation and restarting of the heart and blood vessels, the respiratory tract can release the secretion and thus spread through the air.
When it comes to the risk of transmission through feces, it is considered to be low, with the highest incidence of infection being from people with symptoms.
Although it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, according to The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days, and can infect two to three people from one person to another.
Specifically, the virus has been found to live for up to one day on paperboard, three days on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) and four hours on surfaces containing 99 percent copper.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and varies accordingly.
Soaps and detergents can be effective if used properly; soap products lower the thick protective layer of the virus, neutralize it and isolate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other remedies, such as benzaconium chloride and chlorexydine gluconate (a type of surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken within two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest number of pathogens and the sixth patient had the highest number of pathogens in the next day's test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus with severe respiratory symptoms that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia at the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease Center.
All the characteristics of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in its related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that creates its protective bubble.The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus reaches stem cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in other types of lung air cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike to bind to ACE2 and enter stem cells.
Acute cardiac arrest is also reported in 12% of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, and is frequently seen in severe illness.
Symptoms of acute cardiac injury are common during disease outbreaks due to inflammatory response of the system and immune system degradation, but acute injury of the heart muscle may also be associated with ACE2 receptor factors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Examples of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) have been found to be prevalent in severe patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorly ordered diagnosis.Autopsies of patients who died due to COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage and inflamed white blood cells in the lungs.
Although SARS-COVID-2 has a tendency to infect cells including the respiratory marrow cells for ACE2, symptoms of hyperinflammation are seen in severe COVID-19 patients.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretory T cells were found to be associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-secretory monocytes and acute pulmonary disease in these COVID-19 patients.
Autopsies have also shown an influx of white blood cells.
The World Health Organization has published several guidelines for testing for this disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted test method.
Respiratory samples obtained from the throat are usually tested, but respiratory secretion or sputum samples can also be used.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but require two samples of blood taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists isolated the coronavirus and published its genetic sequence, enabling laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose an ongoing infection and also tell if a person has had the infection in the past) were being developed, but they were not widely used.
The experience of tests in China shows that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of pathology.
Bilateral multilobular ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and background distribution was common in early infections.
As the disease progresses, it may also cause subpliural dominance, abnormal paving (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling), and conjunctivitis.
There is little information available on the physiology and micro-injury of COVID-19.
Here are some important facts about the diagnosis found in autopsies:
The symptoms are: inflammation of the lining of the lungs, pain in the lining of the heart, stiffening of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs.
Four types of diffuse pneumonia have been reported:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, overexpansion of lung cells, disjointed large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation with white cell invasion and formation of multiple large cells.
Acute pneumonia: Lungs fail and uncontrolled discharge from the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe oxygen deprivation.
Treatable pneumonia: uncontrolled accumulation of fluid in the cavities of the lungs and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs.
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation; leukocytotrophic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding unwashed hands on eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends that you wear a handkerchief in front of your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, or cover your nose with a handkerchief if you don't.
Hand washing is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
To limit transmission from asymptomatic individuals, the CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public.Social distancing is intended to reduce contact with large crowds of infected individuals, which has led to the closure of schools, offices, travel restrictions and restrictions on large gatherings.
In terms of social distancing, people are being asked to maintain a minimum distance of 6 feet from each other.
As there is no known vaccine for COVID-19 yet, and as the vaccine is not expected to be available until 2021, the most important part of COVID-19 management is to control the disease, also known as 'Flattening the Curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after touching their nose, as well as after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC further recommends that alcohol-containing hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol be used only when soap and water are not available.In areas where commercial hand sanitizer products are not available, the World Health Organization has recommended two formulas for locally produced products.
In these formulations, the antibiotic activity is generated by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of bacteria in alcohol; it is 'not an active ingredient for hand sanitizer.'
Glycerol has been added as a moisturizing agent.
Patients are managed through supportive care, which includes oxygenation, fluid therapy and other support to the affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple face mask.
External oxygen therapy has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being seen.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Critical patient and pulmonary specialists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies under one open source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals suggest using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen initially due to symptoms.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially during procedures that produce sprays of bodily fluids in the air, such as tubing or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that during this time, general precautions, contact precautions and precautions against airborne transmission be taken, as well as keeping such patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR).The CDC has also highlighted guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended protective equipment for preparedness: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA has also approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particulate matter such as dust in the air, but their effectiveness against a specific biological medium in other applications cannot be guaranteed.
When masks are not available, face coverings or homemade masks may be used as a last resort as recommended by the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients are not so severe that they require medical ventilation or other such options, but a small percentage of patients are.
The type of medical respiratory facilities available to patients due to COVID-19 respiratory obstruction is being continuously studied for people in hospitals.Tubing can be avoided by high flow tube or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these benefits is equally effective in patients with serious illness.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as they limit the spread of airborne pathogens compared to a ventilator with a ventilator. The incidence of severe disease is much higher in older people.
Even in many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, so a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 critical patients could limit the capacity of the health system to handle the issue of hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the total patients were admitted to ICU, 2.3% of patients required external ventilation technology support and 1.4% of patients died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in China had to end up in the ICU.
Due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complicated and oxygen supply becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control capabilities and high PEEP are needed to reduce the risk of respiratory injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators while providing more oxygen.
High capacity PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing trials since then.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising of these.
Although new drugs will be developed until 2021, many of the trial drugs have been approved for other uses or are undergoing further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the efficacy and safety of these potential treatments.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convalescent plasma therapy as an experimental treatment in patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can show 'close contacts' from the data monitored and thus understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
The app also advises self-isolation if a potential risk is identified and informs local health authorities.Big data analytics on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and their contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to search mobile phone data of people suspected of having been infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telecom handed over the aggregated phone location data to the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to be used for virus prevention and research.
Russia has installed facial recognition technology to track people who break the quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner of Italy, Giulio Gallari, said he was receiving information via mobile phones.
The German Government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 partners.
Also, President of Estonia, Kirsti Karluliud, has issued a global call for concrete measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People can feel anxious about isolation, travel restrictions, adverse medical effects, or fears of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are the root causes of the threats to people's mental health and well-being".
It can be a mild symptom or no symptom at all, and is similar to other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Mild cases usually heal in two weeks, while severe cases can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, we can say that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available on COVID-19.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver, etc.
6% of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 have been reported to have blood clotting disorders, increased prothrombin time, and 4% of these groups have been found to have impaired kidney function.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have high liver enzymes.
The same report said that the interval between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 days were required for hospital admission.
However, patients admitted to the ICU were admitted to the hospital and their median time to death was seven days.
Initial case studies found that the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage along with cellular fibromyoxide in both lungs.
Viral cytophatic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
High levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were found in 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission.
According to the US March report, 89% of people admitted to hospital had pre-existing complaints.The availability of medical resources and socio-economic status of the area also affect mortality.
Regional differences in mortality estimates in these cases are also due to systemic problems.
The decrease in the number of mild cases may lead to higher mortality estimates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of past contact cases may mean that the current mortality estimate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers and are estimated to be 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term frequency of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital officials found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-lasting immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, immunity is likely to be shown, but cases in which a positive test for coronavirus is reported in the next few days after recovery from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be a prolonged infection rather than a recurrence.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin and is spread by infection.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the transmission of the infection was entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that 1 December 2019 was the earliest date for symptom onset.
The official publication by WHO has listed 8th December 2019 as the earliest date for the onset of symptoms.
Various methods are usually used to calculate the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and time period and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time since the outbreak began and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease code U07.1 to deaths from COVID-19 that were not laboratory-confirmed clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death-to-case ratio displays the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
Other measures include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of diagnosed persons who died from a disease, and Infection Fatality Rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and they are based on a specific population of people infected through case reports.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people are infected.
In Italy, at the epicenter of the outbreak, a small village called Castiglione d'Adda has so far killed 4600,80 (1.7%) people.
In Gengelt, the disease was spread by the Carnival Festival and spread to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate and probably not all COVID-19-infected deaths can be formally classified in this way.
Besides, the German healthcare system is not as burdened.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of the population may have antibodies, as reported by a blood donor.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rate of this pandemic is different for women and men.
Studies in China and Italy found that men had higher mortality rates.
Men in their 50s are at the highest risk, and the lowest mortality gap between men and women is in the 1990s.
In China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The exact cause of these gender gaps is unknown, but it may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender-based immunity gaps, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and the development of co-morbid conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women in men may all be factors in higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government did not have data on gender gaps among COVID-19 infected people.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General, Dr. Tendrós Edhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak was detected: 31st December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as, China), animal species, or group of people, following international recommendations for naming, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in addition to "COVID-19 virus".
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease as interim names for the virus and disease, following 2015 guidance against the use of place names for the disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in an Italian pharmacy and the supplier was unable to supply it on time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, magnitude, treatment and other aspects of the disease were created and spread rapidly online.
It was found that humans are capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccine and medicine is underway by the Government.
In March, WHO launched a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the therapeutic efficacy of four of the most effective existing antiviral compounds.
Although there is no vaccine available at present, various agencies are actively developing 'vaccine candidates'.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurotransmitters to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies have been identified so far.
First, the researchers' goal is to create a complete viral vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is an inactivated or dead virus, is to induce a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate immune response of the human body.
Another strategy is subunit vaccines, which aim to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus to penetrate nerve fibers with ACE2 enzymes.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology for making vaccines).
The safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies require clinical trials of experimental vaccines.In Seattle, on 16th March 2020, a clinical trial of one vaccine was started with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent preservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials were being evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four investigations on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, including nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir in several countries, according to a report released in late April.
According to the April 2020 report, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is underway.A number of existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/rytonavir and interferon beta, along with lopinavir/rytonavir.
According to a March 2020 report, there is tentative evidence of an effect by remdesivir.
Patients treated with remdesivir showed clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, this research requires a collective review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that a double dose is very dangerous and can even lead to death.
The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on March 28, 2020, based on the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition Guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir for use against CORONA-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the trial.
Nitasoxanide has been recommended for further testing following demonstration of low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spike protein priming via transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE-2 enzyme.
There are major difficulties in studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin which prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study.Ocellatmivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in trials and has not been found to have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be complicated in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tosilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
Following positive results in people with severe illness, phase II non-randomized trials are underway nationwide in Italy.
Combining serum ferritin with a blood test to identify cytokine storms means that it can prevent the development of such events, which have been thought to cause death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 neurotransmitter antagonist based on a pre-effectiveness study for the treatment of a different cause called CAR T cell therapy, a multi-million-year-old steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosylizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being explored as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it didn't have any particular effect.
Viral neutralization is the intended mechanism of action, by which passive antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are under development, for example, using synthetic monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convulsive serums, which contain fluid proteins from the blood of recovered patients and which contain antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid growth.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
