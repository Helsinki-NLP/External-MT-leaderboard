Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the intersection of each other.
The study of traffic flow is difficult because drivers have a 100% unpredictable behavior.
Thankfully, drivers are now able to act with caution, so that traffic can be controlled consistently and mathematically.
To understand traffic flow, a relationship is established between the three,1) flow,2) density3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of the road facility.
