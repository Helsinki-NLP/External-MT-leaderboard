Rallying to the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign has been a success, and wild noise and cold has been spreading around the world.
"You own the sunshine, I need Iceland", says a woman outside the big world in comments from a YouTube ad campaign, Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another audience farewell will keep Iceland in their hearts forever, and a young woman says she must get there as soon as her fiancé is there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and is expected to wait a few more months.
Another observer asks if the route to Iceland is viable, since there are no planes.
Don't follow the story of whether he's coming from the second season.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who created the ads in association with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that there has been hope for more reception.
I found that many Inspired By Iceland campaigns have been very successful, but this new campaign is already hitting the mark.
Basically, it's about creating PR value, it's about getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in some 700 media outlets worldwide, reaching a total of two billion people.
The value of that enclosure is estimated at 1.8 billion crowns.
It's not nice.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country anytime soon.
According to Eggs, well-known markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also responded, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then came the response from outside regions, such as India, which was not specifically targeted.
"These ads have traveled farther than we thought", says Egill, "but it may have been viewed by over four million people on YouTube.
 We couldn't have wished for a better start.
The opening photos were taken by Dawn newspaper photographer Aärn Sæberg with the banners of the ads titled Let It Out in the middle of last month.
The events took place widely, such as at the Reykjavik School Day, at Reynisfjö, at Skoggarfoss, at Solheimajökli, and in the cave at Hjörleifshöfða.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petursson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson of Skoti Productions and the producer of Óttar Guðnason.
The lead roles included Icelandic Anna Jia and Cuban-Hungarian Murphy Cardenas.
Dozens of Icelanders took part in the commercials, but at the same time as the recording took place in the South, there was another group in the West Country and the West Indies.
According to Egils, Let It Out is just the first team of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aiming for a winter campaign in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Agency", says Egill, adding that the partnership with M&C Saatchi has been a tremendous success.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are dealing with.
Explosive: Talk to the job market, the bio-fund, and more
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, Mr Einar Daddason, will attend the Sprengisand, which begins at 10am on the Wałęśi today.
He is also Minister of Labour and is a keynote speaker on labour markets such as the Icelandic language and other issues.
It also discusses rural affairs and the relocation of jobs to countries that have been poorly developed and controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticism of life insurance investments and propose ideas for the labour movement and trade unions to withdraw from the fund's board to reduce the risk of interest spills.
The tour operator in Austria, Ívar Ingimarsson, and the Director of the Nordic Market Office, Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttur, will then be interviewed about the rural tourist station.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading prediction of what lies ahead.
You can listen to the program below, but it starts at 10.
This Is What She Looks Like Today 25 Years Later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth shows of all kinds.
She gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She has been bored lately, but she has managed to look over the past and talk about Clueless on Australian television these days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she has been a great person.
I have to admit, I basically built my character on girls I met at school who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was, "Donovan told me about his game at Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night out.
About 50 cases were reported to the police in the capital today, and the police journal says the case was wide-ranging.
The day at the station began with the police having to remove a man who had recently been released from prison after spending time there because of a drunken accident.
The man refused to leave after his release and disobeyed the police who told him to commit a crime.
The man was forced to remain in the police station for his conduct.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Copenhagen.
Police also had to remove two men in Bredholt for reports of assault.
Then, a woman sitting in a shopping mall in Copenhagen could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
There was also a traffic jam in the city center this morning.
A driver of a white Renault driver searched for her for a moment and she was then taken into a freelance hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Society - The Religious Fate of the Trialers
The idea has gained traction on the Internet that the curse rests on the season of The Joy of Being, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California that day, becoming the third main character to make a long-term comeback.
Glee is a popular series of singing, dancing, and cheerful entertainment.
The series revolved around the so-called joys of high school students, their loves, and their destinies.
While not always out of the blue, the characters of the show seemed to overcome whatever situations they encountered.
But outside the studio, the cast and crew have been devastated, so much so that theories have been raised that the curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the series ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic abuse case was dropped.
On July 8, Rivero was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had stung themselves in the pool and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned himself.
The high-level search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that Rivera had been found drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is believed that she fell into the water in a great storm and used her last words to save her son.
The drunk driver was charged with a crime.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith went on to play Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the voice of an angel who played a key role in bringing the Joy Division to the road and honor.
Outside the show, though, Moneith was obsessed with the devil himself.
From the age of 13, he had been addicted to drugs and found it difficult to get rid of them.
In 2013, his co-hosts felt overwhelmed, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to be looking for a better way.
Only two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to party with friends.
The bananas were found to be a toxic mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a will.
Moneith had undergone treatment, and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a rash he had previously tolerated well proved to be treatable.
He was only 31 when he died.
His patience was heavy on his colleagues, but to subdue his rival, Lea Michele, he was determined to keep the show going and dedicate the entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah Puckman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Joy Division, or all that until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
When we searched his house, we found a huge amount of child abuse and the matter was soon brought to the public attention.
It was clear that Salling had arrived.
He was subsequently charged and acquitted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then uninsured, was found dead near his home.
The cause of the crash was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell from grace ages ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He was suddenly put to sleep in 2013, at the age of just 41.
The series also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and she didn't tell her sister the bad story, but she accused Roberts of excessive control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she was suffering from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée, claiming that her mother and sister were responsible for her fate.
"My mother and my so-called siblings have nothing left of me but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression".
Michel Lea was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow musicians' singularity and overtones to be the dominant star.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which caused a great deal of shock.
Actress Heather Morris took on a major role in the show.
In 2010, it was the result of a series of unpublished video games that were streamed on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an on-air romance.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her during the relationship.
It can be flowered on almost anything
Children's growth is enhanced when they are allowed to play outside in the garden with their parents planting flowers and watching them grow and thrive.
Flowers are also endlessly possible, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the weather, and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Buying a Boat After Grade 10
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's game schools", says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who flies on the beach in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're in school.
If you're good at fishing, you can make a good living, and I feel great about being able to get out of taking out a college loan.
I also enjoy wintertime", says Axel Örn Godmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who enjoys beach fishing this summer, as he has for the past few summers.
Axel was just brewing at the Tálknafór when a reporter spoke of him late at night earlier this week.
When I was in the tenth grade, I took over the management of boats less than six feet long, and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from high school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jonassen, and I had the boat named after him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and retired from the sea, and he was very happy to see the boat bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat", says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for $3 million.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, and the other half at the end of summer when I was done hunting.
So I had the boat on duty at the end of my first summer.
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
I had saved up and saved up money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my farm money in my boat bag.
Axel was born in Issafird, where all his parents are, but he has lived in Copenhagen since he was a boy.
I can hunt here in the West because I have a law firm with my grandmother in Issafird.
I studied in this area just west of the Rhode with my dad.
I'm moving away as I feel, because this hunting ground covers the entire West Bank.
While I feel best in the West, I have also given in the Snake Valley and beyond.
I have also given for the sun, but preferably for the grass", says Axel, who always rocks a fireplace in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the animals and sings to heaven, in solitary hours out on the balcony.
The network is good outdoors, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid falling into a ditch, but there have certainly been times when something has been wrong, but never a major danger", says Axel, who is fortunate to never be seaworthy.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunt goes each time.
 On the beach, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as the taxi, but then I have been continuously fishing for one and a half hours outdoors.
The beach road protocol says it's so he can fish 770 pounds a day, which he finds awkward.
Other restrictions include not fishing on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and fishing only 12 days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing in May, June, July, and August.
I think sailors should choose their day of fishing based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for people to relax instead of having 48 days of summer to choose.
So the regional distribution could also be affected by mine and the marine areas that are well located by the fishing should be able to enjoy it", says Axel, who draws most of the saltwater fish from its shoreline, but also only the seabed and other unique species.
Axel works during the winter with her college education at the Nupi Theatre School in Copenhagen.
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's drama schools", says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the drama school.
I'm stuck there because I feel this is a wonderful job.
I hope that the psychology field will use me at the college level in the future,' says Axel, who also has a background in business.
Villa in the register prevented the immigration
The villa in the registration paper that people fill out when it comes to land caused the individual, living here on land, not to be called back to the sample.
Registration is not required if the applicant completes the form in English, as is already the case in Icelandic.
"This will be reviewed this week", says a specialist in the field of emergency medicine.
Three internal infections were detected in the Virology Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of the positive cases arrived on July 15, two days after the so-called immigration rules went into effect.
Those who had been in Iceland are then discouraged when they arrive and are again preaching in the field service four or five days later.
The afternoon news reported that the new system had been abandoned.
The border demonstration was negative and he was not recalled in anticipation of the virus.
Kamilla Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of emergency medicine, told a news agency that this could lead to errors in the electronic medical record.
If you fill out the registration form in English, you will not be required to fill in a certificate, as is the case with the English version.
Yet, it was designed primarily for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the applicant was not automatically invited to participate in the sample.
However, Kamilla says that many have followed the rules of homework even though they have completed the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back to work after they arrived.
This week will discuss how to make it easier for people to get involved in the process.
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed on probation.
They all went to the sample room, but two of them started showing symptoms.
The three infections reported yesterday are currently undergoing treatment, but the majority of the cases have been resolved because of two infections reported Friday.
In both cases, a series of genetic analyses by Icelanders have revealed that there is a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In another case, the researchers pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says it should be clear tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation, according to the COVID website.
135 are on probation.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five counties have been reported in the country in recent days.
Four of them are unrelated and the origin of the infection, which came up at the Rey Cup last night, has not been determined.
The infection is still prevalent.
Originally, there were 30 special submissions, but they were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in jail for the new infections reported yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that a sports event has been detected and has raised questions about whether such an event should be held.
John K. Johannsson, communications director for the State Attorney's Office, says that as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
We are constantly urging all those who live here to maintain an individual infectious agent.
We also need to remind people at events that there are certain rules in place that must be followed.
Then you can have an event, says John.
He says that infection can be prevented by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
Rules and standards are also regularly reviewed.
What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Agriculture are constantly pushing for, is to address these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and at service companies.
People wash their hands and drink their liquor.
This prevents the spread of the disease, says John.
We need to keep people on the good track we were on, so that we can sustain the success we have achieved so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims were diabetic 2
Devon Brumfield heard her father's breathing difficulties.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The respiratory tract was turned into a sudden respiratory distress due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death row as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, fears the same thing will happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
New U.S. government data show that nearly 40 percent of those who died were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases by half.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
A slowdown in interest rates prompted Reuters to conduct a survey and reveal the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been diagnosed with the underlying disease.
Diabetes was a slow-growing disease.
Now COVID-19 has broken out like a mighty storm, according to Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also gotten worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best ways to protect those with diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of health professionals.
However, the coronavirus has made it difficult for many to keep a routine for a week.
High insulin prices have also been used to keep people at work, thus eliminating exposure to the virus.
Reuters suggests that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the potential risks of the virus for those with diabetes.
When SARS-CoV-2 passed in 2003, about 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group was at three times the risk of hospitalization.
When MERS did so in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were placed in foster care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a Yale University researcher, says that because the effects of COVID-19 could be prolonged, the disease may have been reduced by a number of previously unknown complications.
'I fear we will see a flood of problems when this is over,' says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may have indirectly led to an increase in complications of diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
New research suggests that the coronavirus may have led to an increase in diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, which are already weak in many people with diabetes.
High glucose and lipid levels in diabetics can then cause a "cellular messenger storm", as the immune system calls it, when it reacts too strongly and attacks the body.
Damage to the platelets can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause blood loss to the arteries.
"This is all one big puzzle game", says Dela Cruz.
It's all connected.
The news has been corrected.
We were offered a champagne, and they left the room.
The couple, Assun Magnusdóttir and Atli Bollason, were invited by the artist Ragnari Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was installing in Paris.
 We loved each other so it wasn't complicated.
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother, Asruuna Magnussoda.
I was very impressed with her.
It was, of course, just the advertisement, but then I found it quite sweet, too.
And still fat, he says.
The husband also remembers the first meeting regularly.
I'm always hearing this story.
Just this weekend, says the woman who also attracted her husband to her first date.
I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, that I love it.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I enjoyed it.
Atli says that the couple have emphasized their relationship by going their own way.
We don't tie our bags to the same knots as the passengers.
We avoid the bus lines that we see around us.
Perhaps that is why they took the work of the sculptor Ragnari Kjartanssyni merely as a celebration, though it would be unusual to say the least.
Christine Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come to a dessert with her, Rag and Ingibjörg, wife of Ragnar, at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps, and got themselves a dessert wine and their own dessert.
They obeyed Ragnar, who led them through his vision for a visual art exhibition that he planned to put up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a massive video project called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Assun described the work as banal and decadent, a sequel to the everyday life of Westerners.
He had a sketch of all the seeds he was going to shoot and finally told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.
The show Ragnar invited the couple to participate in was to show a young couple of millimeters in a minimalist room.
"These are meetings with a beginning and an end", says Atli.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar, although they knew him and he knew them, but they knew us and they felt we were fit for this.
They had a word that they didn't want to advertise people.
Perhaps they felt that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual advantages from performing for others.
They complained to Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it did not take long.
When we pulled out of Snaps, we said, "Aren't we just here?
It just happened.
I trust Ragnari as the artist and his entire team, says Assun and Atli takes over.
It's about love and closeness
The movie was shot in a nice apartment on Myrr Street.
There was a very poor film crew; the drummer, Ragnar and the soundman and the couple.
After the recording was finished, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Assun.
We hadn't decided what we should be like.
We received some instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unconcerned about what we were doing and for who.
"It was nothing to play with, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated", says Ashrun.
But was it romantic?
"Well, it was a bit romantic", says Atli, and Ashurun agrees.
We were offered a champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation at a fine hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
When Tommy saw this, he cried, he was so happy", says Atli.
'It's about love and closeness as much as it is about relationships,' says Ashrun.
The couple's parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard his son's voice at the Reykjavik Museum of Art and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns and starts to piss on it", says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this before, but then my dad just texted me and said, "The joy of being with our little family at the Palais de Tokyo, is ripping up Ashura".
And would participation in the work deepen the relationship between Ashurun and Atha?
At least we're still together, so maybe this deepened something.
"It made my relationship with the family deeper", says Ashurun, laughing.
Assun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else", she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see this because this is just one of the seeds of a much larger work, and when you see this with the other works, it's really great.
I could have gotten a little out of it and just been proud.
And there was a little bump in my stomach", says Ashrun, who was unable to have the couple's second child when the video was recorded.
It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them in the first volume of A Song of Love.
Swansea with a first-round victory
Swansea won 1-0 against Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first match of the group stage to qualify for the Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea Stadium in Wales.
The halftime score was 0-0
The home side of Swansea took the lead in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bowling alley and defended himself.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game one less, and in the 82nd minute, the Swansea players took advantage of the team.
Andre Ayew then improved the wicket by scoring a great goal and ensuring Swansea's 1-0 victory.
Swansea lead 1-0 in the singles, with the second leg to take place next Wednesday at Brentford.
No minister for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the limelight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed lifeboat as he feared for his life.
However, the president of the United States has not been unable to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as ambassador to the United States in April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falkword.
During a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President's Office saying that she would not be considered a disgrace.
After she fled Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
In some ways, this may explain why Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but resigned.
When he finally took over, Loius Ariega had been in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned in the fall of 2013 and took up a position as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came a second period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, but no ambassador had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, but not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and campaign manager for Barack Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both ambassadors and senior officials to the Washington administration.
So it was two years before the U.S. Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to question him and confirm his final appointment as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to Parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but that his wife, who died, had been broken by a Dutch rock.
Gunter is a political appointee, formerly a California dermatologist, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an avid supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been there since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest such period in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been nominating people to the House of Representatives and how the past few years have seen the U.S. Senate's work take a long time, including confirming an ambassador.
Since 2009, there has been a total absence of an ambassador to Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the mission from building its new headquarters in Engjateig.
The construction costs are estimated at $6.5 billion, but the building is surrounded by thick walls and has glass windows.
However, it seems that this is not enough to fill the current ambassador with security concerns because he is said to be concerned for his life and has requested an armed life support.
Former IBV player was racist in Iceland - It was a mistake to come to Iceland
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, claims to have been subjected to racism while in Iceland and to have been a refugee.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, published in the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, a team that plays in the Ugandan Premier League.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in the country when he played with IBV, Val and Trótti in Iceland.
When I first came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to.
The team was in that position, but he also had the number of cards I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted", says Tonny, who played on the right flank during the season with IBV.
Among the topics discussed by Tonny are the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This happened to me once, but since I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was being said to me.
Later, I learned about the case, and I asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent had made a racist comment about me after I had tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistakes he sees most of the time.
Tonny had failed to make the starting lineup at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted", says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably have gone further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has fulfilled his dreams of becoming a major league player in Europe.
Find a snake in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch-long black snake in the throat of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor pulled the snake out with a stick.
An investigation revealed that the parasites were being studied.
CNN is reporting this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but the parasites on board are often raw meat or fish.
Since sushi became popular in the West, cases of parasites eating people have increased, CNN reports.
Fear that a second wave is beginning in Europe
Spain is now in a state of emergency over concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, but there authorities have taken action to restart the coronavirus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been frozen for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken action on the spread of infection in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to register when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travel to Spain.
Infections are also rebounding in France and Germany, where governments are struggling to balance the spread of the virus and the economic recovery.
Europe, however, is in a good position compared to the rest of the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest numbers in the Americas and South Asia.
The number of confirmed infections worldwide has reached 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of confirmed deaths from the virus has reached 644,000.
The Mosaic Kingdom Finally Rejoicing to its Fullness
In front of Reykjavik Customs House is a large and deep hall.
There are men in orange helmets inside.
There's a big grave there too.
And more smaller jobs.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the hallway is well-maintained, and many now reside there, and they appreciate the artwork of millions of mosaics like they've never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it didn't seem like it.
The work has been quite elaborate so far, just in front of it were parking lots that were always translated.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped to their destination in the city center.
The vibrant and diverse public spaces and attractive urban spaces are the guiding light for the current reconstruction of the Safety Road.
The goal is to beautify the area and to allow the mosaics of the Virgin Mary at the Tower to be better viewed.
The square in front of the building is well-lit and is considered a suitable place for travelers to stay.
The artwork will be displayed and the venue will now enjoy the 142-square-meter-long space.
The area also features small water sculptures, which offer a game and give the area a certain appearance.
In this way, the renovations are illustrated by the city of Reykjavík, which is under construction alongside Veitum.
The water, heating and electricity systems will be renewed.
Many have reached their full age, but the school codes and the Cold Water Act of 1925 have served the city's residents and businesses for nearly a century.
When the road reopens at the end of construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a single-aisle space and soon creates a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
A advertisement on the customs official's website about the Customs House says that the building was commissioned in 1971 but that its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the sea ice that passed through the building, 250 square feet of windowless walls formed out onto the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such floors would have a negative impact on the overall picture unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The authorities agreed to settle the matter by putting a permanent artwork there.
During this time, much was said by the artist Gerdi Helgadot, the quotation says.
She had worked extensively on musical works in Germany and elsewhere.
The invitation was to contact her first before deciding whether to run a competition.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect life at the port, after all, the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she had to think about such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from her country of exile, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She decided to take the time she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly asked to do the work.
She was also asked to sign a full-fledged agreement with the famous German art company, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerður had long worked with them to create famous works of art throughout Europe.
The works were designed by Samjors Tocht and Gerður, who built the workshops at their brothers' workshop, which then oversaw the construction of the Customs House.
The whole project was done with exceptional skill, both by Gerðar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary says.
Has that been the case since the unfortunate Icelandic weather crisis?
The work took about two years to complete, and was completed and installed between 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Tower, aged just 47.
Suburban transport of more institutions out of land
Minister of Social Affairs, Asmund Einar Daðason, is proposing that more public institutions be transferred to the country in the near future.
This was the Minister's statement on the afternoon's "Blooding the River".
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Human Resources Department's drilling facility will be moved north of Saoudjarok in the fall.
Six firefighting experts work for the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the National Association of Fire and Emergency Carriers has criticized the shipment of supplies.
I think we should take a step further into this creature.
I'm preparing a further step into this creature.
Faster transportation, said Asmund.
He says convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more public institutions spread throughout the country.
"I think more policy decisions on the transfer of public works to the countryside need to be made, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency", said Asmundur, but he also cited other organisations that have been transferring to the countryside and have played a major role for communities outside the country, such as the transfer of the Food Authority to Selfoss, Landmilling Iceland to Akraness and the unemployment regulation on the Skogstrand.
All the highlights from the second day of the championship
The 94th Icelandic Championships in Freestyle ended today at Þórsvelli in Akureyri.
A number of countermeasures were put in place on the second day of the race.
The event was held with an exciting women's shortest event at Þórsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic meet in the shortest in 2014, which lasted until Elisabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR added the shortest in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Open back earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic Open since summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been dealing with injuries and has not caught up to date.
She only had one hit out of five, throwing a .25-foot-9, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest throw of all time, or 60.08 meters, on her last attempt and set the course.
Her Icelandic measurement, set earlier in July, is 62.69 meters, and she was still a little farther away.
Godrún Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir of Ireland had the second-best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH England's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's best, safest winner, threw 73.84 metres in his second final throw and set a counter-measure.
His size in the article is 75.26 meters.
The Olympic and Icelandic cycling champion, Guðni Valur Guðnason, won the ball race at Þórsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in his main sport, the cycle race.
Iceland's Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest throw today at 59.13 meters and secured the win.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-longest throw today, but he had one valid throw that tied for second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic long-distance runner, won the long jump with overtaking, but Hafdís jumped the longest of the current length of 6.25 metres, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic home.
In the women's 200-meter race, Ireland's sprinter Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir set a mark of 24.04 seconds, while Iceland's record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Godbjörg Jonah was lucky to win at Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and 4 x 100 meters and then again in the 4 x 400 meters today.
In the men's 200-meter race, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH took first place with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Maana Samuelssyni of Árman.
Like Godfather Jonah, the Colbein Head won gold in the 100m yesterday as well as the 400m.
Don't get punished for 27 million crowns of Bitcoin cuts
The IRS has rejected a request by a tax inspector who demanded a fine for misrepresenting his profits from the sale of the Bitcoin coin.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Taxation had not provided a clear reason why the man should be fined.
The committee's decision states that the Director of Taxation considered the man to have been able to identify material misstatements in tax returns due to the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
He had misused his profits from the sale of the $27 million Bitcoin coin, either deliberately or out of great negligence.
Fines the man for his feast.
The man refused, writing to the committee.
However, in 2016, he sold electricity for 27 million dollars.
Hannah would have had a computer in 2009 and 2010 when it was both easy and inexpensive to do with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electricity, the taxation of such sales was vastly vague and unpredictable.
It would have been better if ordinary citizens had been aware of such tax arrangements.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes on the collection and would have reported his assets in a statement as a deposit on the balance sheet.
He would have asked his acquaintances and the tax official how this was being celebrated, but without success.
He then considered that he should consider that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
So the man was right to assume that his taxes for those two years would be repaid and enforced but otherwise not punished.
He then claimed to be a fan of Iceland and had paid taxes here in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to discharge his duties in a disrespectful way.
The demand for a penalty would be unfounded and would put him in debt.
Brynwolf is a talk show host.
The brunette Andersen Willumsson has been a popular choice among people, but also sparked a cult following for his progression which is the result of playing with the Pepsi Max division's Bread.
The BLACs will be on fire tonight when they meet the IA on live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
The Bronze Wolf then takes the game out because of four reminders during the season and does not come to the game with a new cut as in the summer games so far.
He had a paper, paper, paper on his neck for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character then this was rather better to try in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants the ball every time and if there was anyone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or create it", said Godmund Benedictson in the Pepsi Max stunt, when allegedly battling the Bronze Wolf.
I'm supposed to be here for the people.
 It is sometimes difficult to discern his position.
He looks a little left-handed when it comes to feeling at the game, but he has a very free roll in the squad", said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkel, the wife of Peterson, says that the Bronze Age is a real entertainment force and celebrates having such a colorful man in the league:
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to meet and answer interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people who are fascinated by him, who tell me that this guy understands what football is.
I'm a fun guy.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
People are reading the interview with Brynjolf, people are paying in and watching what happens next on his hair.
"This man is just a genius", said Manny.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - I've been in contact with several teams in the B-League
Tobias Thomsen, a Pepsi Max player from KR, appears to be out of the team.
According to the Danish news outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the incident.
Tobias wants to start the season at home, but to do so he must first resign from his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic odds.
"The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me great understanding", Tobias told Bold.
I've been in contact with a number of teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the season ends.
There aren't many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay off my contract with KR.
Then he says he will probably have to take a pay raise in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably found more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.
Bjartmar, a bicycle manufacturer, has reclaimed a bicycle worth millions of dollars - now responding to a TV interview
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has been passionate about the subject unlike most others.
He's a man of courage, saving lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and vets.
Has Bjartmar earned the nickname "the wheelchair winner" for his work?
Yesterday, there was a lot of noise when a man posted an account of his interactions with Bjarthmar.
DV pointed to a Facebook discussion of a group of Westerners where it emerged that Bjartmar had taken the man to the East Valley and said the webbing may be stolen.
The original writings of the electrician were nothing more than that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the preview of the original news release has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive of what actually happened yesterday in East Wales.
Bjartmar said he received information from the victim of the electrical fault that these were indeed his electrical charges.
The information was obtained from others, but it turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
I looked into the garage and I checked the scooter, ending up with information that there was a scooter that had been missing for a very long time and was being sought.
I certainly did at first, but when I saw him preparing to start on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his guilt, so I decided to talk to the man.
I generally go very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say the man had taken away my word.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electrical switch offered to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yeah, great", said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight.
Then the owner of the power supply started to prove ownership of his power supply and started the fire.
Later, the rightful owner of the power plant shared his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this year Bjartmar has spent on his practice, he says he can count the changes he made on the edge of people's fingers.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavik", Bjartmar said, adding that cyclists are the least-wanted brothers and sisters in the community, drug addicts, mentally ill people and others who are on the streets for some reason.
"The government is a tough landlord and somehow it needs to finance the next step, because unfortunately, stealing on such loose capital is an easy way to that end", says Bjartmar.
I'm really good with these people, so I've brought a lot of good people with me.
Examples include people who have been receiving treatment and have come to me and helped me with what I am doing", he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is on courtesy notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, bike numbers, and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has been little discussed.
Bjartmar further says that the police have even begun to urge people to talk to him on a wheelchair.
Bjartmar dislikes the former DV newscast and claims he's not some kind of self-made cop in his personal quest for justice.
Asked if he had not yet been on the ice with his act, and if this was not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar said it was.
Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are clearly not doing this.
I have to picture watching the police drive away from a large pile of wheelchairs.
She is quite frankly unabashed in these matters.
"If the police are doing nothing about it, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved such great success in riding on wheelchairs that he sometimes drives his "bike champions" on the street that they only have the right bike they had previously ridden.
The two times Bjartmar has called for police assistance has clearly shown that she is not coming.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bicycle owners", Bjartmar said, lamenting that victims of bicycle theft must suffer from the emptiness of the police in this class of cases.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
There are stories of people everywhere thanking Bjarne for giving their possessions back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the total race is of course in the millions, if not millions.
There's a lot of electrical wires, electric bicycles and electrical bullets, but an electric bicycle can cost under half a million.
Bjartmar works at a playhouse during the day and every other weekend he works in a cottage.
His riding is therefore an unpaid job that he enjoys in his spare time.
Life-saving and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of life insurance in Iceland.
Officials had, in fact, received pensions from the King of Denmark every year since the 19th century, but in 1919 the official pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public servants.
The basis for the current general wage pension funds was then laid by a series of general labour market agreements in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with a duty division and authorised fundraising from the end of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed to establish these contracts, and the system continued to evolve.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century brought about through its struggle.
Unemployment had been similar in the historic industrial crisis of 1955, and the organization gradually received its advanced demands for sickness and disability benefits, substantial leave, shorter working hours, housing reforms, and much more.
All these rights were the subject of a fierce struggle, but they proved to be far more enduring than the rise in wage rates, which, as many remember, disappeared in the heat of the postwar inflationary crisis and into the 1990s.
The effort to establish a general fund for life insurance in 1969 was both long and complex.
While people eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of the fund's partners, the labor movement came to the conclusion that their boards should be composed of representatives of both business and fund associations.
In the years following the founding of the Fund, the demand for a majority of the Fund's board of directors was often discussed in wage-earners' organizations, but never came to fruition, and we are still sitting on the unfair agreement that the representatives of the Fund's members do not have a majority on the Board of Directors.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the obligation to insure the rights of the beneficiary and the operation of the life insurance fund provides for the investment policy of the funds.
The first issue of the magazine states that the "life insurance fund" should have the interests of its members in the foreground.
Also, the 5th issue states:  Lifetime Funds shall set a moral standard for investments.
The provisions of the Commercial Life Insurance Fund's policy, in continuation with the aforementioned provisions, include:
The LIFE Fund is a party to the UN Responsible Investment Regulations (UNPIR), along with many of the largest LIFE funds and venture capitalists in the West and Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues and good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment-driven securities policy.
Thus, the interests of investors are intertwined with the goals of the wider community.
LV considers it important that companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gild Foundation, the country's largest fund, has a policy on responsible investments, and it has provisions on similar topics.
All of this is being mentioned here as an introduction to the latest fashion term in Icelandic, shadow management.
Since the word is new to the subject, it is not expected that it was defined as a "shadow", but the following definition seems to me to be the most accepted: Shadow management is when a statewide corporation executive tells the media that he intends to send a recommendation or recommendation to the company's board of directors on how to take a stand on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
But if the leader doesn't go to the media and talk about the report, then it's not shadow management.
I let the reader reflect on which path he finds more shady.
There are two men in particular who have tried to fit this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are the reporter of the Newsletter, Herd Eggisson, and the bank manager, Asgeir Jonsson.
The two sides' dispute arose after Icelandair's President Bogi Nils Bogason announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with aircraft and aircraft operators (say off), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, President of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, sent the recommendations to the company's representatives on the board of the Lifetime Chamber of Commerce Fund not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, or to propose that they be divorced.
Later, Bogi Nil withdrew his decision, and Ragnar Thor followed suit with his suggestions, which of course were in direct opposition to Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, the Horde and Asgeir saw reason to cover the matter in the Friday newspaper The Herald with high-profile comments about shadow government, crime, and the need for sweeping changes in the law.
Little flour would certainly carry heavy waste, even if the blessed flour had been in a state of fermentation and was also quickly dried out.
Since this is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.
I've covered the details of the life insurance law that are relevant to this case.
They include that the board must take care of the interests of the foundations and have a moral standard in investing, and these points are further articulated in the agreements of both the Guild and the Lifetime Fund of Merchants, as I mentioned.
However, life insurance funds should NOT look only at short-term retirement plans in their investments.
Such a policy would be extremely dangerous and should not be long sought to judge in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have led to immoral adventurers and environmental issues, with disastrous consequences.
The Icelandair president was obviously on the verge of a nervous breakdown when he decided to wipe out the entire team of employees, thereby significantly diminishing the company's well-being in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time will tell whether the investment of a life insurance fund in the company can be held liable to the foundations once it is established.

One of the infected did not have a homecoming opportunity
One of the three people who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from the Baltic States on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic, but he is not a permanent resident and was therefore not given clear instructions to maintain the so-called "homecoming" route after arriving in the country and to go on another mission a few days after arrival.
He got a bad taste at the border.
"But he is in an Icelandic community and he really should be dealing with it", says Kamilla Josephdóttir, an expert in the field of surgical anesthesia at the Department of Agriculture and Alternative Surgery, in an interview with the newspaper Fréttablad today.
He used the English registration form and there is no requirement to register the teacher and if the teacher is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the later show.
She says that the man could use the English registration form because he is actually living abroad rather than because of his connection to the country of Iceland.
He didn't accept it, though.
 If the teacher is not registered, you should apply for the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way to go", says Kamilla.
So obviously we need to raise the level of information on this while we find a way to automate the delivery system even though Icelanders do not apply for their teachers.
Or to somehow make it more obvious who the participants in the Icelandic community are in the registration system, she explains.
Fortunately, the arrival of the Icelandic citizen is not without its importance, even though he is identified as a participant in Icelandic society, remaining Icelandic.
Only six have been sent to jail since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six of them were in his presence.
They are due for a screening, but two of them have started showing symptoms of Covid-19.
The man received a negative result from his sample at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says that he may have been recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus to the country.
It's not entirely possible to argue that this is definitely an introduced infection because it's been a long time since he came to this country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have made a little bit of a breakthrough in the sporting world.
However, she says that is highly unlikely because of the small number of people who are identified here.
"It's actually very unlikely", says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until the genetic analysis of the virus in humans has been determined.
If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that it brought it to the country.
Piper spray and explosives used against protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and unarmed hand grenades, but protesters broke down bars and set them on fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial discrimination were widely protested across the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestor was shot to death.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for peaceful protests.
A group of people then lit a fire on a construction site and broke the bars in the city courthouse.
The police later declared the protest to be violent and clashes broke out between the protesting groups and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was among the protesters.
A car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard men gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried guns and joined closed street protests where police separated the group from a group of protesters who also carried guns.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white barber in May.
Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United manager, doesn't want to make too much of the importance of Leicester's game today in the Premier League final.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will finish fifth and lose the Champions League.
But then they should still hope to reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We're not at the end of the line.
If we score against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad season now", Solskjaer said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to catch by two teams ahead of us", Solskjær said.
Apparently, people's nerves are getting a little tighter at 3 p.m. today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend like it was just another game.
If you want to be a Manchester United fan, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is building on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it", Solskjaer said.
This isn't the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our time, we have already had many moments that define this time.
"Bruno Fernandes's life has changed a lot for us and I think we're in a better shape and stronger spiritually than last season", Solskjær said.
65,000 sun-ring infections
65,490 new coronavirus infections were reported in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the Western Ocean since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days, the number of deaths from the virus has exceeded 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the U.S. government's prediction of the number of deaths from the virus will rise to 175,000 by August 15.
Fear of Another Wave of Distress
The Spanish government is now trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID19 on Thursday and Friday.
No more sunsets have been reported since early May, and the tide is coming in at the same time that the Spanish are starting to clear one of the most rigid exits in Europe.
The tax was imposed on passengers arriving from Spain by the British authorities to take a check-in on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worse in Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain, where governments have taken on broader restrictions to try to keep pace with growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, theatres will be closed for the next two weeks and senior centers will be closed at midnight.
The exits are now valid for 200,000 inhabitants in the province of Segria, in western Catalonia.
The decision is expected to have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is highly infuriated by the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly plagued by the crisis.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are reportedly preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but little interest seems to be shown in re-engaging in the massive expansion that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken such a view very seriously, and it is similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation would not survive, economically or socially, if a national exodus was again taken.
Many advocates hope that local measures that reach the population of a particular town, city, or region will help to contain the virus in the next round if it does.
Five new cases in Iceland - three inland
Three internal contaminants were detected yesterday, plus two at the border.
Five people tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday in Iceland.
A public health official said one of the infections was related to the one reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football game.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and 16 others who were close to him in solitary confinement.
The victim was involved in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the report, only part of the sports team.
Others sent to the prison are related to the man in another way.
The source of this infection is undetected and the State Attorney's Office's infection detection team is fully investigating.
Opponents of the ReyCUP protest have followed the current guidelines and rules of evidence-based medicine and public safety and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of the convention attracted attention as the viewer was able to celebrate the good fortune of his team out on the field in close proximity.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the protesters posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: "Parents, please respect the rules that compete in school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another case was reported yesterday, but it's related to the one reported the day before.
The announcement says: An Israeli genetic study has identified the infection and identified a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.
The case is also under investigation and is being isolated and 12 are in solitary confinement due to infection.
The third infection is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was found in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement with six others who were close to him in solitary confinement.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and further investigations, such as a work on the transmission of sulphur at the border, are awaited.
Finally, the statement says: The Public Safety Department of the State Attorney General and the State Department of the State Attorney General urge people to be vigilant and pay close attention to personal infectious agents.
The least likely to doubt the presence of symptoms of Covid-19 is the same person being asked to go for a sampling at the next health centre.
Patrexfjörður says the camp is booked for human trafficking - Guides guests to another
The Patrexfird farm is complete this weekend, according to a Western Village report.
Guests are encouraged to explore other possibilities.
Other options include West village Billdudal, Talknafjörð, Melanes on Rødasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík.
Enough of being on Patrex Square this weekend, because like last year, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
Since 2007, it has become a strong tradition in the city.
The camp's charges that judgement can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather doesn't set a barrier, but DV said earlier today of a well-drawn forecast.
But we can expect the worst weather on Sunday, and we can expect the Patrex expeditions.
The BBC website first reported, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already booked.
A whole apartment building is falling into the best place in town.
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 1820.
While the owners are applying for a building permit for renovation, their specialty has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods in Reykjavik, there is a three-story high-rise apartment building.
On the ground floor, the house has about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are two-stage doors that enclose four rather high-rise apartments.
They range from 1,300 to 1,300 square feet, though most are over 100.
The house has a rich history to store.
Built in 1959, it has housed a video shop, the Forestry Office, the Dairy Store, the Joe Gun Factory, a fish market and, most recently, the University Press.
The house has, as the word implies, a beautiful memory of its fifty years.
The house is now in a state of serious disrepair, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. include Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went to Borgun's ownership group and was a defender of Borgun's ownership group.
The owners of the Borgunar holding company include Steel Ship ehf.
Steel Ship is an investment company of the Virgin Mary and her children.
Godrun also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Godrun and her husband, August Gudmundur Sigurðsson, once raided the Steel Ship.
D18 bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has been little or nothing since.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, though most recently.
According to a neighborhood resident's Facebook page, the house has not been particularly vibrant in the past year.
This may be a gamble that the owners have spent several years changing the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house has been in a state of disrepair for a long time.
It's been a long time to do something normal with this stain and it's boring that it's been drawn like this.
He also says he's angry at the owners for not having done this, found some common ground with the neighbors, and quit this "legal" thing.
Just do it in the community so you can get on with it and get it done.
The legal process referred to by the resident is the planning process of the building, which has been ongoing since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then sought permission to build a floor above the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator and a single-story addition as well as basements.
The building permit granted for this project was welcomed by the Environment and Resources Committee and revoked as the project was not in parliamentary procedure and the scope of the inspection was insufficient.
Reykjavík City then started the planning process and finished it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
The Commission also welcomed the proposal and withdrew it in March 2020.
By this time, nearly three years had passed since the initial building permit application and the homeowners were on the road.
The house had been hit by a massive collapse and the neighbors were getting tired.
When the D.O. asked the neighbors about the situation and their response, they were answered in different ways.
Some understood the owner's intentions, others not at all.
Some directed their anger at the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily out of nowhere.
Others said the parking lot was a waste of time, but neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 1820 parking lot under their vehicles.
One plaintiff in the case said he was tired of the administration:
That we're going to have to go through the process in threesomes is absolutely incredible.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read.
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A reminder of the similarities between the city's administration and the owner's intentions and their many years of work now underway.
As the reporter was gardening on Dunhaga 18, he was blown up by galloping doors and garbage dumps.
Playstation computers and new TVs were lying within another trash can on the ground  victims of Icelandic summer squall.
The old University Press office was opened and there were many cats of the Dutch court.
It's clear that someone has been shaving around in one corner, but no one is visible.
A stack of sofas and beds and a few pages of geographic papers, which were likely to become a book, blew up.
The entrances to the apartment were open and there was life in both.
A journalist was so lucky to attract the residents of their neighborhood.
There, the Romanians were having a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce union.
They've been there for a while and the company has reportedly paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
The condition of the house makes it unlikely that a rental will be made.
From the post office in the back of the building, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have been living there in recent times.
Employment records have not been partially cleared by the Covid-19 situation, a decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector and these two sectors have been the most successful to benefit from employee services.
However, the householders of Dunhaga 18 seemed busy, and the workers and the workers in the community were forced to work in the rain after a long day.
It should be noted that despite the dismal condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed well maintained.
When a journalist told the boys in Romanian, the coldness suddenly became clear: 1,500 square feet of real estate in the best part of Reykjavik is being destroyed.
The owners want to make the house a better place and the neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree on the definition of "dwelling".
The city's planning sector is thus at the crossroads of the initial process, the victims of the endless appeals process and the appeals process, and the phase of the dismantling of the Environment and Resources Committee.
The house is occupied by Romanian workers, perhaps the ones who will help to improve the situation when the Icelandic people stop fighting.

In response to the coronavirus epidemic, the fight against obesity
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will spend £10 million on a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on emergency declarations, following his serious illness, in part due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign will encourage doctors to refer cyclists to their overweight supporters and will also be a response to the growing cycling epidemic.
Then, emergency TV ads will be banned by 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
COVID19 has raised us to the shameful and long-term consequences of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is convinced that we must use our time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier diets, the government spokesperson said.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight problems, but he was placed on life support when he contracted the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Better Wives Are the Leaders of Change
She said the new constitution was the greatest step the nation could take toward greater separation of powers, greater transparency, and greater anti-corruption efforts for the greater good.
We need to change the rules a little now, and who is better at leading these changes than the community that has the easiest way of being part of these rules.
There are women, "said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their feminine attitudes.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes.
She said she was somewhat dismayed by Iceland's focus on the world's best gender rights and human rights.
Then we're not quite ready to see what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a cliff.
We need to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the rows of hunting parties.
We don't all live by the same rules here, "Selga said.
In an interview, she said that women are largely good at things in Iceland, but added that, like everywhere else, Icelanders build strong masculine values.
She said that the government moved to create its own interests, dominance, and power that were the forces that sustained the misery of all societies.
"Women are now ready to form this group and come together and are just a little upset that Parliament is going to withdraw to watch this 2012 referendum", she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about.
In addition to human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really at the same table, she said, adding that the above values were the foundation of the new constitution.
 We are a very rich country with natural resources, and it's ridiculous that people live in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can exchange differently, said Helga.
It's ridiculous that it's a natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It is ridiculous that airmen and nurses must fight endlessly just to get a decent wage.
The list of signatories to the new constitution can be signed here via electronic means.
Attempted to kidnap a pedestrian in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he stalked a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the drug production in the village where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle driver in the Hlyde, where he was driving at a maximum speed of 60 km/h (146 km/h).
In addition, he had previously been denied driving privileges.
The police in the capital had had enough to do overnight, and from 5 a.m. yesterday to 5 a.m., a police journal had written about 80 cases.
Specifically, there was a lot of noise announcement at the time because of the noise.
The following Saturday, 11 loud-mouthed collisions were reported, and the police journal covered it extensively.
But last night, 22 police officers were on the phone.
Six were held in a prison cell last night.
In the city, police were called in the night when the elements fired shots into the air.
However, they were ready to avoid when police officers came to the park.
Nine drivers were arrested for drunkenness and drug trafficking.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Two were then taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in the West End.
One was taken to the emergency department after he was injured in a trampoline jump in Copenhagen.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a bicycle home on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle equipment of the wheelchair house was, according to a police diary, in very poor condition and was shut down.
Can stay at Monet's house around the shopping mall
The house, where the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
Next night in the house is about the shopping mall.
The house is small and rugged, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, the next time it's open is every week, on the Sunday of the month, so it might be a good idea for some holiday shoppers to book the painter's house.
The two nights of retail sales cost only $964 a month, or just over 130 thousand ISK, depending on when the newsletter arrives next.
Dozens of them are starving, and some of them are starting to show symptoms of the coronavirus disease
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the past three days, and most of those infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been hospitalized for this, and some of them are beginning to show symptoms of the virus-causing disease.
Three confirmed cases of the coronavirus at home yesterday and two at the border crossing.
An expert at the Office of the Agricultural Physician says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in the community.
It's been traced back to the last inland storm, and there's a virus that hasn't been seen here before, so we have no specific reason to believe it's been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very well protected now,' said Kamilla Sigrid Josephdóttir, an expert in the field of registered nurse anesthetics.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples are taken the next day, but a few who were at the same time infected have started showing symptoms of the coronavirus.
"There is no flu now, and less so than other respiratory diseases, so we can be quite liberal in doing this test on individuals who at the time of the flu would have found a reason to do something else first", said Kamilla.
The majority of the withdrawal is complete, but it does not rule out the need for more to go to the bathroom.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
Has it raised questions about the legitimacy of such events?
The Director of Public Safety says it's okay as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
Camilla says it's almost impossible that the infected people were infected at the games.
If these individuals are not isolated after attending these sports events, we can say that our attendance at the events has worked.
But it's not clear, said Kamilla.
The Department of Public Safety's work is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate", said Kamilla.
In a week's time, the crowd limits will be lifted to 1,000.
This new location could have an impact on the occupation.
Determined to Meditate on Cooking - See the Meal Table of Elisha
Elisa Vedershdóttir is a football referee who plays with Val.
She also has a master's degree in nutrition, is a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for her day's work and often takes time to cook a good, nutritious meal.
"My normal day starts at 8:00 a.m. at work", says Elisa.
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the gym at about 3:00.
Elisha finds it very encouraging to pick up her daughter early for kindergarten.
 It's good to spend time with her before I go to the second party exercise.
It's good to come home after exercise and just heat up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we enjoy watching one program to calm our mind.
Elisa does not follow a specific diet.
She is completing a master's degree in nutrition and is well aware of the benefits of eating to her health, including the energy needed to work, attend school, support her family, and exercise.
 What I enjoy is a variety of foods that are well-rounded in protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
I think it's more important to have a healthy relationship with food, not to classify food as bad or good, but rather nutritious or malnourished.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.
Elisa is very interested in fireworks.
I find it a certain meditation to stand in the kitchen cooking and so much to do.
I must say, I have confidence in my kitchen and I have a deep conviction that I am a good cook.
Breakfast: Seaweed, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left in the milk of the goat for the night.
Top this meal up with what's in it every time.
Most often it's bananas and jumping muscles & coffee.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Millie: I'm incredibly miserable, but I could eat fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, fresh skins with bananas and musk, bread with a hearty, and then I could eat hummus with a shredded box if that's what it takes.
Lunch: I often offer all kinds of delicious salads from the fridge, cinnamon or onions, falafel balls, rocksalt, baked vegetables with good training, which are a few of the things I'm working on.
If the plan goes out of bounds (which happens a lot), then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and sweet eggs, don't add any more.
Michelle: Bring me some carbohydrate-rich exercise bread, breakfast cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a riot following a mass demonstration in the city center.
Police yesterday even seized explosives and pipes to try to burst a large area that protesters had subjugated and to spread over several halls near the city's parliament building.
Police said on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was under way into a recreational activity that took place at the city police station yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters attacked police with rifles, bottles, explosives and other explosives, and one policeman was taken to hospital where he was treated for his injuries.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was intended to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, but a busy city has seen violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed local federal prosecutors.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, to remember Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and calling for an end to it.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the resignations of Icelandic airlines, which are due to take effect at the next month's meeting, will be withdrawn.
The electronic vote on the Icelandic Aviation Association's airline contract will end tomorrow afternoon.
The company's president, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says he is confident that Icelanders will not decide on the resignation until the results of the vote are available.
"This is a perfectly good thing", says Godfather Lynney.
 No resignations have been withdrawn, this must be done so that human machines can be made.
So people are naturally anxious to know if they will have a job after the end of the month.
The vote is on a contract signed a week ago, ending July 19.
Gert is expected to remain in force until the end of September 2025, based on a contract previously voted on by airlines.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Air Transport Association of Iceland approved the declaration of a joint military operation of Icelandair, which was approved by the members by a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Iceland's decision to stop negotiations with the airline, resign all its flights and seek contracts with another state-owned airline.
The airmen of the airline were then to take on the temporary duties of a security team.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Godlaug Linney said it's hard to say.
People are in pain after this move by Icelanders, when all the airlines of the company were cancelled and announced that they would be merged with another state company.
Now it's clear whether it has an effect, she says.
940 aircraft were employed by Icelanders at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their resignation period is a failure, for those who have completed their employment, it is three months and ends in the month of July-August.
That group includes about 90% of Icelandic airlines.
What happens if the deal is not approved?
Then we look forward to continuing our conversations with our interlocutors.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelanders.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airline has gone too far.
The vote on the covenant ends and Icelanders announce the second quarter's resolution tomorrow
The airline vote on the new nuclear deal ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but earnings forecasts show that revenues have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the Air Transport Association of Iceland and the Association of Icelandic Business Associations will begin on Wednesday 22 July and will end tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
The contract is open to Icelandic employees who pay a membership fee to the airline.
The Icelandic authorities and the FFI signed a new clause agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday the Icelandic authorities had terminated talks with the association after airlines had voted on the previous agreement in early July.
Icelandair had then informed all the airlines and air crews of the association to cancel on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new lease was signed.
Under a new contract, airlines must fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The agreement will run until 2025, but it has already agreed on the terms of the pilot and freighter's time limit for a single flight.
The agreement was announced to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, describing many airline movements that the news agency discussed at the time over dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement would have to be approved to keep the FIFI alive.
Icelandair's second-quarter balance sheet will be presented tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, operating income for capital and taxes, is negative, according to broadcast earnings figures, of US$100 million to US$110 million or about ISK15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Kauföll emergency financial statements last Wednesday, saying that the company's revenue for the quarter was about $60 million, or about $8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $154 million at the end of the quarter, or about $21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer shares in the company in August.
Icelandair aims to complete deals with 15 lenders, the government and Boeing by the end of the month before the IPO.
A new strain rather than a new type of virus
A new virus simply means that this was an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been stirring up in the country", says Már Kristjánsson, chief of the Infectious Diseases Department at the National Hospital, about the news that a new strain of the virus has been detected in the country.
Three internal contaminants were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports team at the Rey Cup football tournament but the source of the infection is unknown and the infection rate remains high.
The report also found that a person who arrived in the country on 15 July had been infected and that two people who were with him had begun to show symptoms of COVID19.
Then yesterday, an infection was detected, linked to a virus that was reported the day before, and a genetic analysis by the Icelandic National Institute of Health revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.
The infection is terminated in connection with the infection.
Mar notes that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread worldwide, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to speak of a new strain of that virus than of a new strain of the virus.
Asked what this meant and if it could tell us that a second wave of the epidemic was beginning, Mar said that it was a case of a near-fatal accident and that it could be nothing more.
 However, if there are domestic cases that do not have foreign links and have the same culture as this particular variant, then the decision could be made [on the second wave], but it is timeless to support such a decision, explains Már.
The Good Luck in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness in hot pots?
BBC journalists are leading a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that there are no equal bathing places per capita anywhere in the world.
Natural global warming is the basis, but so is the tradition of worship that prevails here.
Children's health education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are not yet able to use hot water for their health.
Health is described as a determining factor in the overall well-being of a country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of position or position.
The use of cell phones brings people together on private notes about their homes and spaces, or they use the similar power of water: meditation and the charged electrical circuits of their soul and body.
The rockets are to be called for a hundred days in the election
There are 100 days until the United States elects its president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he's got a long way to go.
Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has a big lead over Trump nationally, according to analysts.
According to a recent AP News Channel poll, many Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also highly unwelcome, and more Americans than ever before believe the president has been unfairly critical of the economy.
In fact, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32% say they support Trump's response to the crisis, and 48% say he has been successful in economic matters.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden has 49.9 percent of the national vote, while Trump has 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance on the Biden crisis, pushing through so-called cultural divisions and announcing policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden's campaign, however, is highly competitive to keep Trump's attention and believes he is likely to win by a wide margin if the election is really about how Trump has been in office for the past four years.
Trump's defeat also seems set to bring down Republican lawmakers and the Democrats fear that Democrats could even win a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far seemed very successful.
Politico reported that in those days the following party and candidate were held to be equivalent and that is now the Republican Party would sound its greatest root in decades.
The party's performance was particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now looks likely to continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to intimidate the suburbs to follow him, including by saying that Biden will become president, will break the suburbs of the United States and will push for racial segregation.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a White House bill from Barack Obama that was designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged the US House of Representatives to read an article by the former New York Deputy Governor, where she argued that Biden would destroy the US House of Representatives and Trump would take over.
Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!
The population of the American countryside is a growing group of electors.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all U.S. voters.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate with the most votes in this group has been elected president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney won a majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The poll showed that despite Trump securing a majority in the 2016 election, his followers have been significantly reduced.
While it varies between the two canons, Biden has recommended a fifteen percent increase over Trump in recent elections.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, director, host, and singer for nearly six decades.
He is best known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Since then, he has hosted the board shows Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the most-watched person on American television and has received recognition for his work.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
Many colleagues, friends, and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last hour.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the walk?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that has been only fueled by world wars to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic Games would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", pointing, in a possible way, to the global pandemic of coronavirus that the world is now experiencing in unity.
Africans have an additional year to prepare and the Japanese authorities are adding to the costs of the delay.
Everyone's got a lot of heads.
When the announcement that Tokyo, Japan, would host this year's Olympics was made, the joyful spirit of the Japanese delegates was not disappointed.
They cried and laughed for the change, after Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games but was able to do so instead of Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to be the focus of the world.
The Games were scheduled to run from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If the games cannot be held, if the coronavirus threat remains too great, the games will be stopped.
But no one wants to think about it.
The Olympics are not a regular sporting event.
Nothing to spare, the show should always be great and try to top the last games.
The selection of cities for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's recommendations.
The more magnificent the presentation, the more likely it is to be successful.
Tokyo spent $150 million to try to host the 2016 Olympics, or roughly $20 billion.
Later, when the 2020 Games were announced, $75 million, or about 10 billion crowns, was put into the promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was set to host the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already committed 30 billion crowns to the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, given the cost of building an Olympic Village, a theme park, and generally strengthening the country's infrastructure to host, organize, and host such events.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be held these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by Japan's state auditor published late last year found that the cost was nearly double that.
The cost of delaying the games will likely not be fully met, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore be between $15 billion and $30 billion.
These figures are so high that all the Icelandic government's tax revenues accounted for only about half of the Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are events of such magnitude that they have become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to dig into numbers and examine the benefits and drawbacks of the games.
At its core, many seem to have concluded that the Olympic Games have a positive but not negative impact on the economies of the host cities.
The short-term effects are some, such as a very large increase in short-term employment, but over time cities are sitting on the edge of debt and high operating costs of underutilized manpower.
Rio, Brazil, has significant debts related to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
A survey of the London 2012 Games has revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympics in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that there was little talk of new jobs.
In general, cities have not made much money from hosting the Olympics because of the cost associated with man-made facilities built for the games.
The benefits, however, are seen in the increased tourist traffic to visit the Olympic Games following the Games, which is highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether the number of spectators attending the games will be enough.
The main issue, though, is the honor that cities are willing to have, but it's hard to put a price on it.
For, despite the enormous cost, the joy of games is not something worth putting on.
But while the exhibition is a huge one and there is no savings, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are at the forefront.
For some adults, it's surprisingly easy to delay games.
For example, the Australian Olympic gold medalist and former Olympic gymnast Chloe Esposito, who was a long-time good-looking athlete this summer, hopes to compete in the 2021 Games.
So she's one of those athletes who's just more than happy with the delay, for good reason.
For athletes who were planning to retire after the Games this year, they would have been held on time, so in some cases, postponing the Games means they will be retiring before the Games take place.
Just don't trust your body to go through years of extra rigorous exercise.
Few athletes have been as fearful of the 2016 Rio Olympics as the five-star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds and a bronze.
Biles has recently interviewed several people in his home country of the United States about the Olympics.
She plans to play in 2021, but she's not sure she'll be at the top of the game next year, because she'll be 24.
Although not generally considered to be a high age, it is more appropriate for a female actor in the lead roles.
"This is a sensitive issue", says Biles, but smiles again in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she plans to reach the same lengths at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll be at the top in a full year of extra practice", says Biles.
She has previously said that her body no longer supports the stress of physical activity.
However, she is practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the Great Depression was at its height and the theater was closed.
Biles was no exception, no exception, and all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic golds could not buy anyone access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
I'm sure you'll find the basic shape of your eye better than most people.
We have a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we've come a long way, and I'll be adding to the exercises evenly and tightly depending on the weather.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we practice and given that they will be, we can't help it.
"I've put in too much effort to quit the sport now", says Biles.
Like many others, the site is blindly or perhaps more aware that the games may not be held in 2021.
But predicting it is hopeless.
No one can predict the outcome of the global coronavirus pandemic in July 2021 and have no choice but to prepare for the Olympics as they are held annually.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid pandemic.
A recent wedding delayed by illness
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now", the actress told People.
We definitely want to get married sometime and have that dream wedding and have all the presentations that are dear to us.
But we decided to take a step back and focus on what's important right now, and that's helping to share information about the importance of wearing makeup and staying home.
I'm looking more at worldly things than wedding stuff these days.
There is much going on, and we should pay attention to what is happening in the world.
