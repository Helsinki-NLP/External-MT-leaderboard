In addition to confirming that some dinosaurs had at least blue, a theory that is already out there, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional order.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal is chestnut brown on the upper side with a pale or cartoonish underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of the bird's plume.
Since dinosaur blue lacks well-developed shafts, called rachis, but has other features - arches and teeth - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the lungs suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, although these are young dinosaur bones, the sample shows adult lungs and not a small egg.
The researchers suggested that, although this was a young dinosaur skeleton, the sample showed adult and not male cows.

Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as the emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cardiff.
Adekoya has been in the Charedin County Court since being accused of murdering his son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eye-witness evidence could be corrupted because her image has been published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have looked at publishing photos as something that could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish images of suspected persons".
The Crown Office, which has overall supervision over prosecutions, has advised journalists that no further comment will be given until at least the end of the day.
The document, according to the secret source, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics that are discussed include the future status of Jerusalem as holy to the two nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for five years only.
Pilots in the additional pest control trial would be closely supervised by keepers, as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and Sport Shooting Society of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Society's overall programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park's Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Electoral Council of Perpetual Change (CEP) yesterday.
This is the first CEP Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, which had been due to be held since 2011.
About 60 cases of defective overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 24 additional cases of over-booting, with the company calling them "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's redaction of the report "really unfortunate".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
Former Filipino gangsters have kept Hong Kong tourists in hiding by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several bodies have been recovered and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six detainees, including the children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced the toilet as the toilet was needed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Hospital for Women in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government researchers discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow warriors also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Eithafia. My first mistress. Luna died on the night of the second moon. She was as unique as she was. She was strong".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked that "Luna is so strange to me...more so perhaps...I love her and I will see her wishes...hope she is in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
The survey's 34 percent share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the end of the survey, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should not become a republic at all.
She was an Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relay races, but her fitness is in doubt due to her problems.
He has not been able to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain as they have been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several individuals using hardware and software by early February and was published on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of supplying water to the earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets have collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the clashes as "political and fiscal cliff".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of tons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses aerial-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to position aircraft more precisely and give pilots more detailed information.
No additional transport is organised and no above ground trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or parking and travel facilities available at the stadium.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species had evolved in just two generations, although they believe this process took much longer, due to a bridge between the endemic Darwin's rose, Geospiza fortes, and the resident cactus rose, Geospiza conirostris.
There are ways to work gold into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a fine wire, which can be turned and flattened. It can be rolled or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin, and then glued onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can make a pointer using a red brass solution.
The absorption of the powder changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H is the pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry bowls together and then, with clean wet hands, crush them into balls.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of rock.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flooded water well in almost every house, connected to a complex drainage system.
Traces of carthusian systems have been found in the ancient Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the early Roman period, bathrooms were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a phone.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us transportation that's much easier and faster.
It has brought the train, the automobile, and many other transportation devices to us.
Since then there have been larger-sized cats that have eaten medium-sized prey ranging from mammals to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) eat the much more numerous small predators such as insects, rodents, mammals and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of the wolf, a special job for each cat that keeps him from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called colonies.
Conjunctions include one to three related adult male lions, as well as up to thirty females and monkeys.
The women are usually closely related, in a large family of sisters and daughters.
Silk structures behave very similar to those of fleas or dogs (but not other large cats), and are very harmful to their larvae as well.
An all-round athlete, the tiger is able to climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of a lion is not the roar of a lioness, but the sound of twenty words of a man that is called.
Oselotians like to eat small animals. They will catch mice, rats, rabbits and birds if they can. All of the animals Oselotians attract are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that oselotiads follow and find animals to eat them (intelligence) by spying, sensing where they have been on the land.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very slowly, too. Ostials expand their eyesight by adapting to their surroundings and then jumping on their eyesight.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moved across a series of mountains or a river, or if it moved to a new island so that it is not easily moved back) it will often find itself in a different environment to the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "pregeneralization", which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, plants are the majority of the food we eat, and without plants, animals could not survive.
A mosasaur was the most powerful predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long mouth was filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the back of its mouth, meaning it was immune to anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have been a hunter, and his diet may have included lobsters, large fish, other mammals, and even a canary.
He also challenged anything that came into the water; a dinosaur carcass like T. rex wouldn't even match him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual banquet items, including wild bacon, pea, mushrooms, and a type of pea called the pathew.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together by resting on their chairs while they ate their food dishes.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no rice, no tomatos, no tofu, no choco, and the same Roman never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods that was considered the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then six inner chambers that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called siguratas, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sacred altar to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; open counters were the stores facing out across the street.
There were no big trees in the lands of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
The island was surrounded by forest. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red had driven it from the Land of Ice for murder, and that as he travelled further west, he found the forest and called it the Forest Island.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kingdoms, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure chest.
Inscribed on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, and is tilted to the right.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known early in his life that the large vellum document (measuring 29 inches by three-quarters by 24 inches and a half) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added as a label only.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
They were ruled by the French "Vichy". These were Frenchmen who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A culture is an individual culture shared by a significant group of people who live together and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, belonging to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Original culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, permanent cultural backgrounds and fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as proper descendants.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed the first centralized government - with only Congress as its counterpart - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and, because it had no national executive or judiciary, it relied on provincial authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He had no authority to set the laws of taxes and tariffs between provinces.
The Articles required unanimous consent by all the states before they could be amended and the states were so deprived of government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as a "continent".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Four Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty-three percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used photographic format for solid-state photography in the world is 35mm, which was the previous film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital cameras' image sensor formats.
36mm wide by 24mm high is actually the 35mm format, which is a bit confusing.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are roughly equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and twisted rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamics while maintaining orderly measurement in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, became the object of scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christian religions had bound Europe together despite the extreme differences in language and customs.
His all-powerful influence affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and arweiniai this concentration of power and much money to question whether this creed was to be answered.
Shortly after the war began, Britain launched a flotilla against the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain encroached on international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited naval warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and horror of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous post) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods of time; each period of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided states between each of the three dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was a fierce struggle between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting for the top seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are a number of social effects such as the use of the metric system, the move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Careers were also open to all male applicants after the Revolution, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of soldiers because instead of the ranks of the army being based on the region they were now based on the quality of the gun.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working class people who were under ban in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this mortal life. He used to go to a cave that came to be called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
the cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Lying on a ridge of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the hole, it's total isolation.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures that have been built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains a number of pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bows up" mark looks like a V and the "bows down" mark looks like a staple or square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the bow (where your hand touches the bow) and pull the bow.
An upbeat usually produces a louder sound, while a downbeat is louder and more distinctive.
You are welcome to mark your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks are there for a walking reason, so they should be treated with respect as usual.
King Louis XVl, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth frightened, were on 6 October 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a chariot, they were driven back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to have their car windows opened to the head.
At one point a member of the tribe beheaded a royal guard who was killed in front of the Queen who feared for her life.
The imperialist war effort of the United States in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. Treasury to pay a large amount of the interest on funds raised in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the special benefits of exploiting the Filipino people would be equivalent to the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (OC 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, traditionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide variety of ideas in practice, from pushing technology or technological expediency to the sharp sense that human destiny is motivated by fundamental reasoning associated with scientific laws and their translation into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond broadly cultural or political influence, and that technology turns it into having "effects" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially mediated.
For example, someone might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for car hire alone, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Crowd ownership of cars also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a great element of cultural determination in Romanticism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography of individuals was shaped, and over time the customs and culture that belonged to that geography were codified, and these, existed in harmony with the place of society, rather than as orally imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Caer Gystennin was considered the fashion capital of continental Europe.
Its reputation as a center of wealth began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and cider that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, fashions in the west may be lagging behind for up to 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of dress. One of the greatest developments of the age was the introduction of buttons to close clothes.
Conservation agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Crop rotation is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to achieve the highest possible yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel they are being neglected by social norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their generosity through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and etiquette.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the unfortunate few instances of children who were not, through neglect, unwillingness, or intentional abuse, socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or "savage". Some wild children have been enslaved by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the children were abandoned because the parents refused to harm the child mentally or physically.
Abused children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma as children before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the fetus exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely those of the particular animal that cares for it, such as its fear of or aversion to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaling goes beyond that.
Scouting is not a method of learning but rather a supporting aid for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scarf can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scarf but so too is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Rhetorical scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that might have been challenging for the students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect, abuse, and even maltreatment.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our nutritious care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
There was a care to be taken to provide all the necessaries which were not provided in the home which they had taken away.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialising" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighgmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the study of micro-presences, surface movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to find out whether an individual is lying by correctly interpreting micro-signs.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can correctly assess speech impedance.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century genetic research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the source of the expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move back and forth between two spots with each generation.
Outside of the saphenous, it is difficult to breed with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult to spend on primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (wheat, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a high protein content containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors would have solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees on the shelves do today.
A sleep break is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without waking you fully.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your bed, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the circadian rhythm involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which we know is dehydrating) before going to bed, forcing one to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace that a person has in a relationship is the opposite of the amount of pain in a person's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing that prevents us from achieving enlightenment is our own negativity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was influenced by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it involves Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of perfect love.
In Kundalini yoga the Kundalini energy (i.e. light energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and imagery.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Godhead. Through the visualization of various gods the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are enlivened and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A. By the end of the war, system, process and culture conflicts were causing the countries to clash.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and would be fought in real, ground-based combat, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish guard had already broken down, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize the entire Romanian troop.
However, these plans were displaced almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the breakaway regions of Belarus and Ukraine after attacking eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Antimonopoly Treaty, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The function of courts has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, using U-boats primarily.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to overcome Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and fur.
Generally, domestic goats were kept in herds roaming mountains or other grassland areas, often tended by goat herders, usually children or young people, similar to the more familiar buffalo.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagon tracks consisted of only wooden pallets, they enabled horses to pull them to higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Line slipers were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused excessive wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known form of human travel, and humans began walking precisely two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "Erect Man").
Unlike their predecessors, the Australopithecus walked in a rectangular pattern.
The fossil record for Australopithecus dates to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases.However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should reduce them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of mankind's overconfidence and unpredictable way of life.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap prints".
The first public reading of this document by John Nixon was in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap manuscripts known to survive are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have a blue body and they can fly.
But there are many features of birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with claws and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two legs like a T-Rex.
All general-purpose computers used today are based on the processing of information that is stored in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as hives, are sufficiently general to require a diagnosis.
Perhaps the best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of a medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize human beings.
Killer bees and bedbugs are colorless, adapted to live in a nest or in the home of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method leads most scientific research.
Not alone, however, experimentation, which is a test used to test one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalistic and philosophical scholars focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As understanding of the Greek world declined, the West found itself torn from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of neuronal circuits and their production by biological clocks.
Synchronous rhythms, which are not responses to external synchronous cues alone, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free cycling even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the earliest suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage bacteria, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by either marking the DNA in the fungi with nucleophilic phosphorus or the protein of the fungi with a nucleophilic sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are smooth cells.
Only mutations in older cells can be passed on to children, but mutations in other places can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the sights, including wildlife and plant life.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others who go to their work destinations in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic single-passenger vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, and supports the system.
Now, science suggests that this huge carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable conditions that has supported human evolution for the last two billion years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In less developed countries you will hear similar sounds of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of constancy; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These towns help to plan, design and implement road facilities.
The first animals to fly were primates, whose ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and to find food and water more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their genitals back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only beetle that can't bend its tail back is the serpent's servant who watches Mai.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Sun's axis moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide at times.
The 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical complexity.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which had been on the plateau for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Papists.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in ancient form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more appropriate for the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what you see.
In essence, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing came into prominence, the pencil was radicalized to less status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without having to go near a caller.
One can only guess what the key will be when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and the core still releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no push.
The Moon's surface is made of gravel and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the grain.
The grammage is about 70 kilometers wide on the near side and about 100 kilometers wide on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more leaf spots on the near side because the graven was softer. It was easier for the flame to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or wants that have been modified as they mature into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular inclusion theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise as leaders begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the hogs" (or subjects).
This type of manager has difficulty making popular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The rider teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as it is possible that their team meets at different times that their local managers may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the rational team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the laborious process of setting up a learning institution?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional areas of an organisation, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as common knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help establish a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of knowledge, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more detailed.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior aids scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Advances in technology are allowing us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that were never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although science fiction is a relative term for Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computing, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Artificial Intelligence research involves automating work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it is built into many home computer apps and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the answer with field trips.Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the nation's capital, the website is updated annually, but old versions are kept online to serve as a guidebook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog began to make efforts to improve her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces pupils to become more aware of the world around them".The need to feed the audience's interest inspires pupils to be competent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "incite students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other writings as well as outline their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of a modern, bilingual Canada and contains a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as what is considered to be purely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite thinly populated and some are almost completely uninhabited.
For a comparison that surprises many people: more African Americans live in the United States than are Canadian citizens.
East Africa is an archipelago in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the most, and is a continent on its own in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands as well, and gained a large presence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Peninsular Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Mediterranean Sea.
Women: It is recommended that any female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a dress (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realise that cultural differences could lead to what they would consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, to have your arm held, to be picked on.
Be firm against the opposition of men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name Casa Branca, only to be left behind by an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centres there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as rugs, pottery, leather goods, jewelry, and a whole spectrum of jewels, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a bustling city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano along with the Mountain Gorilla trail which is among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorized bicycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a more prosperous town, although its good reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands erosion.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arab or African influences.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Simbabawe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecobars, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and access fees for the Park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists consider it to be its main hub.
The pattern of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glossy bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and aim for the opposite bay of Kowloon.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers took up residence and so if you are looking for evidence of the territorial settlement history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Sundarbans National Park is the name of the part of the forest that is located within Indian territory.
Mangrove swamps are not just forests however - they include some of the last remnants of the great mangroves that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, one third of which is covered by water/core zones.
Since 1966 the Sundurbans have been a haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 mountain lions in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district (across the river) bus station throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between areas are often full, you are advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and rugged Japanese Coaster Fish.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two waters rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two bays 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its native character and identity.
The Ariannin are known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The annual tournament takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and games at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is the same as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley across the road to the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so you should exchange currency before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be treacherously cold; temperatures barely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain that is collected remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing human faces, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/metre away from deer and badgers and 25 yards/metre away from all other wildlife.
However intelligent they may appear, wild boars, deer, elk, moose, and almost every other large animal can fight.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so allow them their space.
Also, be aware that rainbows attract rain and other wildlife, so carry or cook foods that are edible and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the assassination of Tupua chief officer Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland occupies two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes filled with a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Rhif One", which is not a complex beer, but is delicious and refreshing.
There are a number of French wines available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino is toasted with a high-quality shot of huff (not oat), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those incidents on the reef are rare.
However, you should take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The buckthorn sea slug is found near the shores and upper reaches of rivers between October and April to the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific guests, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the application for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your residence (e.g. visa).
However, inquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some holidays, the vast majority of those attending music festivals camp on site, and most attendees consider it to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you'll have to go in early to have a campground close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages has ended, remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some holiday camps have separate camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin's location, as going through the rails causes quite a terrible noise to those most affected.
Saint Petersburg's itineraries include time in the city, and foreign travellers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to make the most of the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or locks, and it can be difficult to find outside exits.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in good spirits, and to keep them in the building.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness clouds judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive on high roads or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snow-covered roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on wet asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there is enough snow to capture you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing or by glare or fog on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic remains virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general usage refers to overland travel to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially on a safari.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to a cart and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting leopards and leopard lizards are sometimes shy and are best seen with a binocular.
Hiking safaris (sometimes called "wildlife safaris", "hiking safaris", or even "hiking") involve hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August until 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you book your travel and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the closure, you may be in a privileged position.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
A damp cloth can be dried by a damp cloth. Many iron pots and dryboards are available for rent, even if no one is present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are not willing to wear a smudged hair, then you may try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to get too hot (which can cause cracking, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers might come across plants unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful coughing, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, nor dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing humans by force, are not normally considered to be bears.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy traffic can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic drinks and thybaco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often crossing through isolated rural landscapes.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, you will be surprised: sharp elbows, sloping shoulders, and rough shoulders are common.
Speed limits posted are impressively lower than in previous and subsequent sections - 35-40 miles per hour is common (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German crust cakes are quite good, and in Mafaria, they are lush and varied, similar to some of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit-bearing crust cakes are common, with apples cooked into a crust throughout the year, and cheirios and eirin appearing during the summer.
Many baked goods from Germany include almonds, barbecue nuts, and other tree nuts.
If you are in the mood for a small but rich crust cake, try the so-called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Chiri is a vegetable-based dish, along with either meat or vegetables.
A liquid can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in North India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a huge variety of regional foods found across the nation.
However, if used without additional conditions, the term tends to mean the food originally coming from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the island, Jaffa cuisine consists of a collection of simply flavoured dishes, and the main flavours favored by Jaffa people are groundnuts, chilies, sugar (especially Jaffa coconut sugar) and various spices.
The horsemen are the keepers of the horses' hooves, which hang down all the way round the midway.
They offer more stability to the rider but can have safety problems because of the possibility of the horse's feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse is thrown from a horse but its foot is caught in the bridle, it could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a saddle and a thin, rather narrow coat.
Next, some knots, particularly knots from England, have safety marks that allow a leather jacket to fall off the mark if it is pulled back by a descending knight.
Cochamó Peak - Chile's main climbing destination, known as Yosemite De America, with a variety of large sandstone walls and cliffs.

Skiing is a major travel activity with many followers, sometimes known as "ski bosses", who plan an entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing down the valley as a camp dates back to at least the second half of the nineteenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, travel skiing or ski jumping.
It is related to but does not include travel on skis or alpine hiking, the latter on rough terrain and requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a walking trail.
In good conditions you can travel distances considerably more than walking - but very rarely will you have to speed cross-country ski without a heavy helmet in grainy routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would involve having to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen zone, however, works somewhat like one country in this matter.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition for which manufactured items are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.

As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations to Europeans or Arabs.
Consultation documents are a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
The views presented are often relative, general and simplified by comparing them with more specific information available elsewhere.

Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A surge is the current that flows back from a wave that breaks off the beach, often in a reef or something similar.
Because of the polarity of the shoal the returning tide is concentrated in a few deeper places, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of drowning while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the tub, swimming back in is neither more difficult nor more usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Second-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is less of a new slave period), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Immigrants who have had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time adjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first moved to a foreign land, people were likely to be patient and patient, knowing that newcomers in a new land would have to adjust.

Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Penrhyn Mountains here join the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota River.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has Antartica's highest mountains, the Vinsion Massif, with its peak at Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (12,030 ft).
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.

Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to contact this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a year away.

Finland is a great destination for boating.The "Land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, lagoons and islets off the coast.
On islands and lakes you don't necessarily need a boat to sail on.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any sailing yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one forty).
Most of the different Baltic Expeditions include a long stop in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go to the coast using boatboard lifts you will not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some excursions include Berlin, Germany in the booklets. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the ticket.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and anxieties of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help to overcome fears based on the unknown or on lack of control.
Transport companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important with business documents, supplies or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some roads, the larger companies have their own haulage, but for other roads and smaller companies it was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air, some routes might have taken days to go through unloading and unloading.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for a business, and one-in-ten times for first class!
In general, there is no point in searching even for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.

Treat the site with all the dignity, respect and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or graffitiing structures.

However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portugal is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern castles are usually extinct by now, and are used as museums, or sites of education.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their early days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on hillsides, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of the geiryosen flower, or hanami, has been an element of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the eirin flower was a flower of choice.

There is a tradition of spending the Easter night in the open to watch the breaking of the wall.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition of course, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility debate.
More traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with the congregations often beginning the midnight celebration to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that reached the islands originally came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the great crane the principal grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, large mice, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
