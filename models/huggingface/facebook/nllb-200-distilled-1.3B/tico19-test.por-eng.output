Cumulative rapidly progressive incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will require care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases progress to a critical illness requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compared them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the above date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them to those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases for each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8am, and compare with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that as of 15 March at 8am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that in Italy three weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health systems' actions, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients who should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for updates.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29,2 beds in Germany to 4,2 beds in Portugal per 100 000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and semi-intensive care beds for a population of 100 000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk greater than 90% of ICU bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional coverage, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and UTIs should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its virus counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research subject.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined for the entire holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus bears a strong resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients dead.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new rapidly developing area.
Wherever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have found twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of healthcare workers was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown, with all public transportation stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the onset of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is rapidly worsening, the final extent and severity of the epidemic is yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, mostly in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters, mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 has been given an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time to death based on onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transit time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA with a specific direction.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha coronaviruses and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike glycoprotein (S) binds to its cellular receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and subsequently membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequencing samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultra-thin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ECA2 protein in a weaker way than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of human full-length ECA2 at resolution 2,9 Å in a complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped together as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The originating host and the intermediate
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggest that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved homologous recombination on the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a large difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days below 20 °C with 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigen macrophages.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus escape immune responses.
Before long, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the cells defend themselves.
However, the CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complementary C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected with it generally need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come on its own or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, chills, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly progressed to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging diagnosis, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is the highest mortality rate for MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when the world's confirmed cases reached 66,576.
Comparatively, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV with respect to their symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients within the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals may contract the virus again, raising the alarm for extended quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzyme and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated and the lymphocyte count progressively decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most COVID-19 patients, and they have irregular bilateral shadows or opacity in the opaque glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ADRS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumocytes, formation of the hyaline membrane, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase  reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which became not derived from RT-PCR alone) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients while also trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygenation, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used to treat severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine cascade is known to result from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune system cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response targeting T cells; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of low to moderate dose corticosteroid treatment have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead supplied the compound to China to conduct some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in critical condition.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in his blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be considered with caution.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that code for effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
That way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, their effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 patients were seen in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, as many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between treatment exclusively with Western medicine and treatment combined with Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time taken for body temperature to recover, for symptoms to disappear and for hospitalization was considerably shorter in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine group alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the Western medicine and TCM treated group than for the Western medicine only treated group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western medicine and TCM treated group than in the Western medicine only treated group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await further well-controlled trials on larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 usually feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric illnesses, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delusions and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health system actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, people with suspected illness and people who have had contact with them, as well as the general population who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected reservoirs animals and people to susceptible hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older subjects and the patterns of lethal challenge and protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical trial can begin.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In addition, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, affecting thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
So building a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer an acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with COVID-19 severity and prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) levels may also aid in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are abundantly present in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved ones and other patients.
Providing psychological counseling and lasting support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stages of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period may produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty for epidemic control.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been considered to occur when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will be over by March, and the slowdown phase will last for three to four months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in throat and mid-cornea swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in terms of its infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which raises a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people in direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or from sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses with sizes from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent face shields or goggles when treating patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to keep away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low transmission rate and limited reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message made people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containing the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public pronouncements, as everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information coming from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal statements from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in containing a potential epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more frequently targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial questions still need to be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologue has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, the bat, to humans?
Without the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission, and the epidemic could relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or will it have a seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the way people thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Research into the interactions of the CoV host in animals can also provide important information about the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we do comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a virus evolution and genome recombination perspective.
The current epidemic of CoV 2019 disease (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positively polar, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses with the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses were called "CoVs" because of their crown morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoV lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV, and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species boundaries, and some have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively large number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the corpus of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The 2003 SARS epidemic is one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a confirmed case-related gross mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The novel 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the cortex of patients who had contracted the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, with disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have shown severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it has been estimated that each infected person can infect approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by later symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are common SARS abnormalities in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophage counts are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at some point.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with a cytokine cascade occurring, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero who was traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of shingles, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide causing mild respiratory illness.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63 that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterised by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore quite peculiar to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high confirmed-case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also designated the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross confirmed case-related mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noted that the confirmed case-related mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the mortality rate outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea present.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high 82% homology in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster in different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease progression are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases may also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and in SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it has to be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it is passed to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oropharyngeal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in the case of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and people who develop serious illness from HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations, causing the common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, as are community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It remains to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it hosts a direct-relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic to that host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV continuously and long-lastingly.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV can have the infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that patient zero of SARS had a history of contact with game.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG, compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, wild or farm-based masked civets with no exposure to live animal markets were reported to be highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked civets could only be the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have antibodies against SARS-CoV; the possibility that several species of small mammals could serve as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat HKU3 CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horse bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except the designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) in humans is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples has been shown to use ECA2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It's intriguing that the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to homologues in bat betaCoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies, as are Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal swabs, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that symptoms, generally mild but with massive transmission of the virus, have been observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no answers as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical CoVs from bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must be among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the early COVID-19 cases have been associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also similarly directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they show a high degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of consensus viral sequences from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of setup and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is still to be clarified.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genomic broad sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of pangolin betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument is for recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betaCoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is very much present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
A bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat was reported to have a direct relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and camelids are also suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for events of interspecies transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them is an alphaCoV from alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphaCoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoVs have caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses to humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been corroborated by later results.
It's obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction, and high flight capability are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral spreaders".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into camels goes back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the amplifying intermediate hosts, into which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus are important in making it easier for CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with revision mechanism, the exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of the CoV by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, it's already adapted to another host that maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and protein functions encoded in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs swap patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, ribbon exchange often occurs during transcription of CoV RNA.
Long highly homologous and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat HKU9.
Interaction of virus-host with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoVs from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the S-protein DLR.
In general, the DLR on the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is at amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize ECA2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were found to be different from human and civet virus isolates in the DLR, and four of these are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein's interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of their S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater for this link than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other correceptor may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also be responsible for the effective adaptation of these CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and host dependence.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restricting factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Non-biased screening with genome-wide reach of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
The new HCoVs emerge: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they were found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion feature of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
The deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to have undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure on viruses, such as pressure on the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphaCoV has a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the patterns.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and low expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress VCO replication and affect exoribonuclease revision, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking a heightened immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations on the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was turned off from CoV replication.
The same strategy of turning off the immune response could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat betaCoV has been found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is accidentally or intentionally produced by humans.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets in those markets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple pangolin betaCoV strains closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it remains to be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how it is transmitted.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around in camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done at wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crises, a better response plan and preparedness should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been around on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of migrating to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance of people being in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued surveillance in mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal is to play the role of the true intermediate host, the way in which it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins, needs to be clarified.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 (2019-nCoV) novel coronavirus infection, which provides a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, one epidemiological history item must be combined with two clinical manifestation items to make a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestation items must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (more than or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity against known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum test; or any change in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase in titer greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which has increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us to look for symptomatic and atypical asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence emerging and ask readers to provide their comments.
For diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest you check and follow the latest guidelines in your home countries.
Our team will also update our guide in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
That's the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bengal's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transportation shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were reported on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, Johns Hopkins University data showed.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced tougher measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's full blockade until May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without showing up for work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the full day, from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order through May 1.
Stores in Australia lowered limits on toilet paper per transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper to two packs and one packet per transaction respectively in all stores across the country.
On Monday, the ALDI also implemented a package cap.
These limitations were communicated through messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Fearing COVID-19, shoppers were reportedly stocking up in case there was a need to isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous four-pack per transaction restriction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles in its March 8 press release reported that even with the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales have seen a "sharp increase" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stock available in advance of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local board restrictions on truck delivery frequency are making it difficult.
He expects high production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stock, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday's promotion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low stock figures in terms of quantity, and that when sold out it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there was an abundance on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were running out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to keep supplies running, according to a News.com.au report.
Real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early bidders at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers going on holiday over the extended Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print from Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on 3 March in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited its Andres toilet paper purchases to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only indicates the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize populations for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside of influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus".
And he went on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the outbreak "is going to get worse, in short".
On Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people, and monitoring and isolating people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus have occurred.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood and therefore the virus is believed to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely related to the bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses.The first person with symptoms known to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and had no visible connections to the later group from the seafood market.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei Province, which may have been the first.[citation needed] On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new reported cases decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant under-reporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was considerably higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official COVID-19 pandemic death toll usually refers to people who have died and tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without having been tested, for example, those who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the official death toll] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the US. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, estimates of the fatality rate have dropped from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed as dying from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection through case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection fatality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually peak and then decline when there are no more available hosts for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment as to when that will occur".
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said it "could be over by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue to circulate for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it is highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the re-emergence will depend on herd immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (cold), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and blue-colored face or lips. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, with close contact considered to be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without a mouth covering can cause droplets to reach 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets can land in the mouths and noses of people nearby or possibly be inhaled through the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the respiratory secretions to fog up, resulting in airborne spread.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through feces, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms emerged, suggesting that transmission is possible even before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals and after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be zoonotic in origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B).
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin virus and human.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has found at most 92% sharing of genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, but definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT scan not be used for screening or as a front-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on breath samples or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab is also used.Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that can detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The features of X-ray and CT images of symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral opaque glass opacities and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of virus images with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper towel and placing this towel directly in a waste container.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. Healthcare professionals caring for individuals who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use by governments of location data from cell phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile phone applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use.[citation needed] As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwashes, which have already proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, several organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective coating.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO recommends avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a variety of solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol 6271%, isopropyl alcohol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide 0,5% and iodopovidone 0,27,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, restrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic cash boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a paper towel when coughing or sneezing, and discarding any towel immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene".
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when in close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less apart).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Health authorities in Thailand are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear a face mask when out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required that everyone entering supermarkets must wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents have been asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a face mask is mandatory when going out, while it is recommended that masks be produced at home for those who cannot afford them.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions designed to slow the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone by staying at home, limiting their travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and keeping distance from others.
At present, many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face an increased risk of serious illness and complications, and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in community outbreak areas. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" led to implications that complete social isolation was needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures now taken are designed to slow down the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system and the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a baseline reproduction rate below 1. Managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is partly about trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This is what we call "flattening the epidemic curve".
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quarantine; community-based measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to crowds; community involvement, so as to encourage acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning contact surfaces.More drastic measures to contain the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Entire cities, for example, were quarantined and travel bans imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, those infected received financial support when they self-quarantined, and those who did not were subject to severe fines.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those who stockpiled medical supplies have been punished.Simulations conducted in the UK and the US show that reduction (slowing the rate of infection without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. reversing the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce peak demand for health services by two thirds and deaths by half, but still, that would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overwhelming health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus in the human population or until there is availability of a vaccine, if that occurs earlier. Otherwise, transmission will resume as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic carries social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19, however, there are efforts towards drug development, which include testing existing drugs.
Using over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration or respiratory aid may be necessary.
Steroid use can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can relieve symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs brought about by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidance to hospitals and primary healthcare services to shift their resources at various levels, including concentrating laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-mandatory procedures and separating and isolating patients who test positive for COVID-19, as well as increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available beds and ventilators.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed to have a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31 issued a statement to the public and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms as of 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
Countries' responses included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home confinement orders or lockdowns) and curfews.As of 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are confined in some way in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
By March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26.
Initial genetic testing on 27 December 2019 on samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A public statement was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a sweeping campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary cordon was announced on 23 January to halt travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 were canceled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan facilities into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums.On 26 January, the government launched further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions have been implemented in Hubei and outside it.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement controls have been implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of restrictions on travel.After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city.On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.China's Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details on when this policy would be terminated.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March, giving financial stimulus packages to businesses.The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning with a three-minute moment of silence across the country on 4 April at 10 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival.The central government, however, asked families to pay their respects online, observing physical distancing to prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea have been put into quarantine after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and quarantined those who came into contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing with results available the next day, and increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities under quarantine.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment on the grounds of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.

Plans to limit travel between the cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between the cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020.
Amid claims of cover-up of the spread of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on February 28 indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government up to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members testing positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch strongly urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there is a greater risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 incumbent or retired politicians and government officials have died from the disease as of March 17.

The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be eased for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of over 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, people are forbidden to enter and exit.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, had to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were suspended completely for at least a month.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of an aging population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that point may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a consequence, the government has come under criticism for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population.[citation needed] On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising the suspension of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis.

The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic near the Lunar New Year festivities".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision by the top authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked because of the "risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of assisting these countries which "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it does emerge".

In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global Coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality statement to every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared", insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a declaration would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction".

The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental health problems, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people in prison, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance.
International governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired over their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the Coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected early recognition of the Coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The United States administration of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was in turn condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to deflect the failure of the administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast got a detailed communications strategy from a US government cable with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with one strategy being quoted as saying, "This is all about China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that there was "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and 'policy of generosity'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran while it was reportedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations into their own country.
And you hear about the mask-related disputes reported between other countries, like Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.'
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they will also act reciprocally if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a small scale.
The Secretary General for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate". The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen current or former political figures.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected as president in the 2020 election.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon over what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products like food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigyo, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, both areas were spared from acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not see a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient feeding of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak was seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges about possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly 'melted' after a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside Mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indexes including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed their biggest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit rating of China but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns over the coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider an economic recession likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a consequence, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Dealer visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping Center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant farm workers were left at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed. An Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German parttime pay scheme has been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people - both employed and self-employed - worldwide.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and assist artists where possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerating impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which were to take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming, or television while others offer drive-in style services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also canceled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents at holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but no later than summer 2021".[21] Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and live poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.[22]
This has led many players to gamble online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates.
Many large theaters like Broadway have also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streamed concerts or creating online "festivals" for artists to perform, share and publicize their work.
Online, various internet memes about the coronavirus are spread as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results from February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving the virus or being punished justly for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is aimed at those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak into new outbreak countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia.Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressing for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Twitter Trending Topics.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, have reported increasing levels of racist slurs as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has come under criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in major cities in India have reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The state unit chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called it "erroneous".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners being labelled as "foreign trash" and targets for "disposal".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the outbreak available in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as early as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out across countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of the cases recorded, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a pharynx swab is only reliable in the first week of illness.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, alternatively, sample material may be removed from the airway bed by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its groundbreaking real-time RT-PCR Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel to public health laboratories by Reagent International Resource.
One of three genetic tests on older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive tests due to faulty reagents, and a test hamper at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 tests nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; collection and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service.On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it specifically to the nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "chest X-rays have less diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings may be present even before symptoms appear".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobaric opacities in matte glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving, and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many aspects of its imaging coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals starting 7 days or shortly after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring.
High-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin pricking.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before testing.On March 26, 2020, the FDA designated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and as of now are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody testing kits were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a system where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards.The UK NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used.In drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a healthcare professional collecting samples takes appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in a country.In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Statutory Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 having been tested the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
Since 19 March, drive-in testing has been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from week 12 of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested through week 12 of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, gathering the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was deemed positive.In Wuhan, a makeshift 2,000 m2 emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye") was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to handle the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity did not have online access.
The Wuhan lab was promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day.Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials.These balanced models can be run in small labs without the need for robotic manipulators for the liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient quantities of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was reported that the UAE is now doing more tests per capita in its population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a population-scale mass processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first of this scale to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests being made available to the US and China and the US faced problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, furthermore, these countries along with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations made by health professionals.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated that strengthening testing programs was the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the US, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents has been affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its testing kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to a failure in sampling or the incorrect use of the kits.
The minister of Spain stated that it would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Health Ministry said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that he would not "use them".
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, had positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With travel to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, and without drastic restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to seriously advise residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened as planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, in-country travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more testing, relative to the number of deaths, had higher lower death rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect those with no or few symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column 'Positive in % of tests' is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Handwashing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oral-fecal route.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or the common cold, for example if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial times during the day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after wiping the child's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, poultry or fish.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And lowering the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in growth in children under five years of age.
In developed countries, child mortality rates related to diarrheal and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas in need.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be associated with handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), as an automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of death among children under five, kills an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia combined are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a deep-seated habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is often associated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a peeling and skin irritation condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the toilet (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's butt (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when proper handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households had the habit of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States near the average at 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several methods for behavior changes currently exist to increase acceptance about the habit of hand washing with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools at certain times of the day is an alternative in developing countries to instilling hand washing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with daily handwashing with soap, daily fluoride toothbrushing, are at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A small number of studies that looked at bacterial transmission from a soap bar contaminated concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic commands for dosing is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely publicized to a health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).[citation needed] A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands as end-consumer antibacterial soaps containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing the natural greasiness that holds dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water based alcohol-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand sanitizer) begin to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers that contain at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based cleansers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and REV), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizers, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick killing action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin dryness unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The desiccating effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol-based hand sanitizers are rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction when compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based agents do not clean hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically been far below alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to the increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and instead use ash or dirt.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than pure water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of the hands, the space between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of plain water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry in the open air.
Wet or damp hands are more likely to be re-infected, and the areas most commonly overlooked are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped enamel can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing where running water and/or soap are not available, for example, pouring a gallon of water or brine with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations with a restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water such as "improvised taps" and other low-cost options.
A makeshift tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever operated by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective way to dry in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by towel paper, heated air hand dryers and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be, on average, 194 percent higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254 percent higher in the rest of the palm.
Air-jet drying caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also performed tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which throws air out of the unit at rated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Towel papers did not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial counts after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Handwashing with wet hand sanitiser is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed simultaneously with interlacing fingers.
If there is residue under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and rubbing in health care systems.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines of the organisation can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
After the patient has been treated, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) gives a hand washing agent a destructive effect.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing, the water in the forearms must not run into the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, there was found to be a greater benefit from hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a slight additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap more than tripled the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution to washing hands with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each revealed that alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26 percent more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers at reducing influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on hands.[citation needed] Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital settings may involve staff awareness of hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and verbal and written warnings to staff.
More research is needed on which interventions are most effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economically viable essential tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable sources of water, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge to achieving universal handwashing practice.
For example, in most of rural Africa, handwashing faucets near any public or private restrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may instead be the result of ingrained habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
Encouraging and advocating for handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and trigger a long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.[citation needed] An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to three stars maximum.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotional campaigns aimed at reducing childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change in habit.As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has announced the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit relationship of handwashing in developing countries with respect to DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health  especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-care-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have caused an increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for proper hand washing" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing your hands" means declaring a reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of more general use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and often place more importance on handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap to wash hands is part of a ritual hand washing characteristic of many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate hygienic hand washing, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow for hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow for hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory etiquette, and a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Functions with a medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be infected or suspected of COVID-19 infection but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in the high-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective covers, and provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and collect or handle specimens of such people.
Appropriate hazard controls for such workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate to the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have a variety of effects in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to care for others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and in terms of the means of acquiring those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or by delivery or drive-thru services).
Finally, shipments of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped.An action plan and infectious disease preparedness can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease action and preparedness plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission between employees, protecting people who are at highest risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in the supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without regard to worker behavior, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as necessary (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), jobs with low exposure risk have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick and wearing respiratory tag, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for handkerchiefs and common garbage, preparing for teleworking or shift work if necessary, discouraging the use of other workers' tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they no longer have a fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relieve other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that they be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with a medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission at the company location, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad, to a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some high-volume retail stores.Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic bulkheads, and installing a drive-thru window for customer service.Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include encouraging workers to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, establishing staggered shifts, restricting travel to locations not at risk of COVID-19, developing communication plans, including a forum to respond to customers' concerns, providing advice on personal protective equipment and equipment, providing training on the use of personal protective equipment, providing hands-on-hand training, and providing a combination of tools and equipment, including protective gear, hand washing and other tools, protective gear, protective gear, and other tools, and tools that are at risk of COVID-19, and providing workers with a combination of training, hands-on-hand protection, physical protection, and other workplace safety measures, and protective clothing, including the use of protective clothing, hand washing and other tools, and equipment, and equipment that require a combination of physical and physical protection, physical, physical, and occupational, and occupational, and occupational, and occupational, and occupational, including the work environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
Crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated bodily fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and prompt reporting to the onboard medical center if anyone develops a fever or other symptoms during the journey.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choral classes, or eating meals in a cafeteria, increasing space between tables, stricter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care facility for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school absences may be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during the seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belts and other accessories before re-using them using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for containment and disposal of worn PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Roles with a high risk of exposure include medication delivery, healthcare, laboratory and medical transportation workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol-generation procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens from such patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high-exposure morgues includes workers involved in preparing bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsies.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some necropolis and healthcare scenarios.
Specimens should be handled with biosecurity level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients admitted to hospital be separated into two separate waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working within 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol-generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 particulate filter facial respirators or higher quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend the use of overalls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening personnel at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective or face shield, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask shall be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We're in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards one another.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, because you keep our workplaces running, you pay our coworkers and you keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to Our Work and Schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At that meeting, we considered what we thought was an appropriate action for what we were experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during that time.
We want to eliminate stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to be away for a while, that's fine.
For all officials, service providers and contract workers:
Our working day expectancy will be four hours, or 20 hours a week, unless otherwise stated.
We're not declaring a holiday, but if you can work normal hours, you could be useful to our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, buy groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring their schedules.
If you're sick, you don't work.
That rule would not even need to be stated, but we decided to state it.
You don't need a certificate or paid time off, just let your manager know to help your team review the calendar and schedules to ensure key work areas are taken care of.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of his training and certification department so that his department can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Personnel who work by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said this before, and we're committing to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly workers.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent of whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll give you our full support.
Many people view work as a way to channel stress because of the current world situation.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Reminding you that your well-being is more important.
We just ask that you contact your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help with the activities appropriately.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we must continue to perform.
The Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of "working double to make up for lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for budgeting, and for employees to prioritize essential work, personal care and caring for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure throughout the organization.
We'll present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps once we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we have employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces as well as the lobby and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its patrons.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located on a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a fully remote configuration, in line with our shared guide to San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they'd like to offer some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them up into several days.
Set up the meeting, have a schedule, and send in advance reading materials.
Use video as your default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor chat questions and the list of participants, and someone to help take notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community-based aid recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing marathons, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We warn you that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we'll continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and community-themed conferences.
The general feeling in the global community seems to be one of sadness at the shutdown, but also of relief at the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communications resources team is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our releases to them.
Keeping up to date on COVID-19 related matters
We'll send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use that time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help you with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other COVID-19 related information on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, feel free to notify them and work with the communications resources team.
We're here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an email to Bryan Judan, Global HR Operations Director.
None of these changes should be viewed as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support it needs and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months, to come.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you're in your best condition when it comes to it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the communications resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also functions as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid and colectin transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II lung alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to the ECA.
The RCT cleaved the hormone angiotensin type I into angiotensin type II causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaved carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradicinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the ECA2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to speculate that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the standard ACE inhibitor and BRA therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analyses published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall pneumonia risk".
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications to help with monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It's in use in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be leased to the government.North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks.A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand envisage apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations have declared eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should contain suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should prevent the aggravation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse should be in place;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking engine from their device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy concerns.
However, not all central server systems need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been designed to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a single app, the system gathered tracking information from multiple sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both the centralized and the privacy preservation system.
As of 6 April 2020, details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracing preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific literature dating back to at least 2013.Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phone devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is done on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for using privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of location or pathway crossings data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a startup that develops privacy technologies and was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same and largely overlapping approach of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, had become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps while preserving privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by updates to operating systems, and later removing it in the same way once the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposition, re-filing, re-assignment, or therapeutic substitution) is the reproposition of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-like proteins, each with multiple binding sites.
Analysing these binding points provides the reasonable design for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds which they then refined and analyzed for their structural similarities to more similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA' s clinical trial process and is authorised through the EUMA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of illness in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence to support the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stockpile it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has been opening up to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ' no benefit was observed'.
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against phylum, pneumonia, paramyxoma, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can lead to transmission or more serious disease.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C taking place for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
New York State began conducting trials with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II study with a type of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from the severely hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or who do not use effective contraception were not included in the trials.
Several blood thinners are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients is looking at the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosing.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the scientific community's attention has been considerable in the direction of giving new purpose to approved antiviral drugs developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19 patients:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) is approved in China.
There are also trials in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with clinical trials completed, several attempts are underway to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) initiative stated in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
the name of the sponsor (s) of the vaccine (s) and the name of the sponsor (s) of the vaccine (s) (s) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if applicable) (if) (if applicable) (if) (if applicable) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if)) (if) (if) (if)) (if) (if) (if)) (if) (if) (if)) (if)) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if)) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if) (if)
The following information is provided for the purpose of the assessment:
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 have been announced but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease while also monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still in preclinical research).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clamp, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working on 11 isolates and even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least between one and a half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" in protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, is currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could go for human trials in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to $29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an RNA self-amplifying vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 medical COVID-19 countermeasures research projects, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
During almost the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if further outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the trial of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that elicited potent antibody-specific responses to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have started 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens from animals specific to COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures to handle live virus, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested on non-human animal specimens.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed Phase I clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectorized vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectorized (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronaviruses such as the SARS Coronaviruses.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is spread between people mainly through direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when you breathe out, they usually fall to the ground or stay on surfaces instead of remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspected virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for mask use by the general population vary, with some authorities recommending no use, some recommending use, and others mandating use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, blue face or lips.
Less commonly, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only tightness in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatic agents play in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Spit and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking out loud releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause the droplets to reach 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in hallways outside people's rooms contained positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although transmission is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, usually one person infects one or two.The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99 percent copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, and eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks down its protective layer.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was seen in 12% of infected people who were admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with recruitment of IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported at the necropsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples taken by a nasopharyngeal swab, however a nasal swab or cold sample may be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese's experiment with testing has shown that it's accurate to 60 to 70 percent.
The United States FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar opaque glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septs with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available regarding the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
The following are the most common side effects of the drug:
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of giant multinucleated cells
The following conditions are considered to be considered:
ADD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudate in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a scarf when coughing or sneezing, and cover your mouth with the inside of your elbow if a scarf is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart from each other.
No effective medicine is known for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be released before 2021, a key point for controlling COVID-19 is to try to slow the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is given by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be helpful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risks of virus transmission, especially in the healthcare environment when performing procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in airborne infection isolation (AIS) rooms in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.The CDC summarizes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The equipment recommended is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure on two levels.
Whether either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stick with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles, compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developing countries do not have enough per capita hospital beds, limiting the health system's ability to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators that have a high PEEP and pressure control mode are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with a variety of illnesses.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from recovering people as treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show its safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been carried out.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are requested to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analysis of cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are alleged to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
As of March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, an agency of the German federal government, to research and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he had been told by cell phone operators that "40 percent of people are still on the road".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may have a mild course, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, as shown by data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, bleeding disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathological changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung imaging looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
Under-reporting of mild cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die, compared to nonsmokers.Concerns were raised about long-term disease sequelae.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
It can also lead to post-recovery intensive care syndrome.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and long-lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronaviruses at a later date.
These cases are thought to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through infection by overflow.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-restricted and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Sex-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of female smokers and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the US government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is for "corona", "VI", for "virus", "D", for disease and "19" is for when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and " 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease" as interim names for the virus and disease, in line with 2015 guidance against using locations in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on schedule, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components that are most likely to be effective.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicular protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have their safety and effectiveness tested.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drug re-targeting makes up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic review of clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medications are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the efficacy of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after it demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial spike protein in preparation by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine storm-fighting properties. Tocilzumab was included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A nationwide non-randomised phase 2 trial is underway in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled, randomised evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy may mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the net portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
