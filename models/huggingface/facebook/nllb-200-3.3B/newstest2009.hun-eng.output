The Prague Stock Exchange was down at the close of trading.
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
The transactions in shares of ČEZ represented almost half of the normal daily trading.
The Prague stock exchange continued its Monday slump from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the decline.
In our case, the market's reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector in the country, is also evident.
Shares fall in Asia
Asian stock markets suffered a dramatic fall on Tuesday, though the indicators later that day reversed some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index was down by almost four percent during the trading period, but later cleared some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange's shares lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6 percent on the Taiwanese index.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect global financial markets", noted Joseph Yam, chairman of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy autonomously, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are on par with those in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and pass a financial system bailout proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are threatened with the consequences.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to boost the financial system, which would have required $700 billion.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the bill would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy.
On Monday, US stocks were in a bloodbath and the leading stock indexes registered their biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell nearly seven percent, the last time it fell that much in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the House had not adopted the proposal, the index started to decline.
Congress has backed down, allowing the U.S. government to pump $700 billion into the banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader agreement on financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
They're voting on it early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system.
But I haven't won yet.
Congress needs to finalize some of the details of the agreement before they can release the final form of the bill and their vote.
The financial support bill for the scheme will be debated in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported by Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee.
Senate sources say the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
Public commentators believe that there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, this is followed by a "detoxification".
The plan must be effective
"We have made a great step.
We have resolved our differences on what the shape of the market stabilization package should be", Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He thinks the final vote could be on Sunday.
The lawmakers' representatives met Saturday night with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury secretary, to finalize the government's funding.
It should buy the non-marketable mortgage assets from financial companies, which cause financial companies to suffer serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
'We are close to a final agreement on a project that will work and that must be effective on the market.
The repair project still needs to be continued, but I think we are there", Paulson said.
Signaling to Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on stock markets, which have fallen sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are working to get a deal through Congress by Sunday.
The move is intended to reassure investors before trading begins in Asian markets, where the time zone would allow the Congress' decision to affect Monday's trading.
It's not clear yet when the two houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, or whether the hearing could be delayed at the last minute due to a problem.
Lawmakers are hoping the bill will be passed in the next few days.
But the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount of aid to the scheme should be divided into two parts.
At the request of President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
But Congress can block the remaining amount, which was set at $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels the program is not working.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this resolution, he can override the veto of Congress.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire physical assets to buy bad mortgage securities that were losing their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgage loans.
"We've worked it all out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of the amount of the penalty payments
Speaking at the hearing, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said lawmakers have agreed to take responsibility for the financial program, protect taxpayers from losses, close the benefits, and schedule the funding bill.
The new law also limits the so-called "busing" of directors participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides help for homeowners who have problems with their mortgage payments.
The government should buy new mortgages on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly mortgage payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual help
The proposed plan, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
'All this because it is impossible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought up.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share losses between each other", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Marek doesn't think it's that important whether the plan is approved now or early next week.
"More importantly, the congress must decide this week to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of agreeing to approve the plan is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
A duel of the blade: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make a phone call.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons why a person might want to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the use to which it is put and the needs of the future owner.
It's probably not easy to get a high-end, high-priced stereo to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulence album.
Firstly, such musical products are not shown on the discs, but there is no objective reason for this from a quality point of view.
However, if your shelves are filled with art rock, jazz, or blues bakelite records, you may be dreaming of a turntable like this.
This is similarly designed for travel, which is compressed -- simplified to MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here.
Some people may find it unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a twenty-crown market headset.
Two extremes, with enough room for everyone.
It's a wide selection.
Battery life is important too
Some of the best music players can do more than just play music, they can do what most cell phones don't do.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to its primary functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a better-than-normal camera, and can even navigate.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures.
Well, multi-function phones have their drawbacks.
The more features you use on your phone, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drainers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most are much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
So, if you're using a cheap cell phone, you can expect that they won't play for more than a few hours.
If you are using a telephone, get a charger for your workplace for safety - even for expensive devices.
MP3 players won't have that problem, even the worst ones can last at least nine hours of continuous play on a single charge.
The next problem is when you're uploading music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions, the player (iPod) does not require any special software.
All you have to do is load the device with music from your computer via USB.
Most mobile phones and players also create their own music library, organized by artist, album, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only display fascicles similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with OS).
Players are easier to handle, cell phones know more
When selecting a specific piece of equipment, you should first consider the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of the audio output, and of course the ease of handling.
If music is your primary background and you listen to it for only a short time each day, such as on the tram, any MP3 player on your cell phone is fine.
And now, any mobile phone can do that.
You don't have to pay much attention to the music formats your phone or player can play.
All of them can handle MP3s, and the vast majority of the music that you get will be in that format.
MP3 is one of the most common formats, and most devices can handle WMA music.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Right-hand mobiles also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
Simply visit the relevant websites of the provider (or other service providers) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a compelling argument for the acquisition of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the service providers' offerings are limited and usually limited to one-year radio stations.
Those prices aren't the lowest.
In general, however, it is likely that this particular way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile device with them at all times.
Whenever he feels like listening to something, he's going to reach into his cell phone while the forgotten MP3 player is lying around.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which is available on almost all cell phones but few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music phones will probably be price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent enough Walkman.
But for the most part, you're limited by the lack of a conventional headphone output.
The best and technically most equipped telephones with the traditional 3.5 mm diameter hole-in headphones can cost up to fifteen thousand kroner.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, that they are easy to handle.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection) are really the ones that everyone can handle.
Minimal function, handling similar to the previously usual cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of a collapse in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet, or the subsequent huge bill for data transfer.
What to Choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for the removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can only get up to 2,000 kroner if you add the right card.
But be careful.
The basic types support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB or less.
Only the most expensive can get started with up to 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are a more demanding student, choose a specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, which makes it easy to operate and close to the MP3 player.
The industry's most advanced product is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series of mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players from the above brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to SEK 4000, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (generally 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe you
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our operators offer virtually the same services as their Western European counterparts.
But we're missing something here -- a virtual service that's forcing traditional providers to make substantial reductions.
Maybe it won't be like this for long.
We have written many times on the Mobil.cz website that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is higher than in other EU countries.
This may lead to a controversial situation after the European Commission's latest move to regulate roaming charges - some Czech mobile phone operators' customers will get cheaper SMS from abroad than from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound counterintuitive, considering we have three cell phone networks and our penetration is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, has often agreed with this, having stated on several occasions that there is no place for a new operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably has not much chance (and therefore probably would have difficulty finding frequencies).
But there is another option - the virtual provider.
It was the entry of virtual mobile operators that led to a significant price drop, to which the traditional operators had to respond.
Meanwhile, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in the UK, there were voices like ours.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can indeed succeed.
However, we do not have to look far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In less than six months, it had managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest provider in the country.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic owns, among others, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is that they can focus on a much narrower target group.
It needs far fewer customers than a traditional service provider to operate efficiently.
It is not associated with relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear to be low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but often compensating for this with fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom offers text messages at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the Mobilking case in Poland shows, it can be a good bet to target a target group.
This service is specifically targeted at men.
"Real men choose the Mobilking provider - someone they like, someone they can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, the operator of the virtual service.
It's hard to say whether a similar idea to Poland's will work here.
Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický, expresses doubts: 'The Czech market is relatively small for the segmentation approach on which most of the virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with regard to the provision of services.'
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is going to be a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region", said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for Penta's financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
In this way, it indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they do their utmost to ensure that no potential competition is created.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in launching the virtual service provider for some time now, and is thus taking another step towards making Telefónica O2 a true competitor in the corporate customer market.
'We are very interested in providing our customers with not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
This possibility was discussed with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations", says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe now is the time for something better.
Unofficial information suggests that we may have our first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
But for now, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider has a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special compared to other markets.
We have not been approached by a single company offering a complex and serious project in this area", Vlastimil Sršeň, from Telefónica's press office, told Mobil.cz.
The other operators also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile spokesperson, agreed with O2 exceptionally, adding: 'We have not yet signed up to a single viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build.'
And he added, "The T-Mobile network is unlikely to have any virtual service providers by the end of the year.
A concrete agreement should be on the table at this moment to be able to think about such a short-term".
Vodafone's focus is on meeting its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with possible virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From the customer's point of view, we consider this to be the most profitable.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find partners to build shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.'
Public authorities - in line with service providers
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, as the entry of another operator would increase competition, lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easy to enter such a competition?
When service providers have something important to do, they can work together, and that's what the U:fon boom was about.
The biggest pressure on the CTU was probably around the birth of T-Mobile's U-phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But now, U-phone is a good reason why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services will place high demands on it.'
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, it is quite astonishing that the Czech regulators have shown complete indifference.
However, this is not just about the attitude of ČTÚ, which in the Czech Republic - unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no right to interfere in economic competition.
The Competition Authority is the only authority to do so.
But the office has a very distinctive approach to the whole problem.
'The entry of a virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
"The Commission has not yet concluded any such contract, as the range of potential bidders was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers", said Kristián Chlapua, from the external relations department of the Competition Authority.
A statement made by a representative of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
But from an agency that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one takes advantage of the market, this is more than strange.
In particular, Kristián Chalupa adds: 'In a country where virtual service providers are usually active, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decline in the price of mobile services.'
However, it is probably not in OHIM's interest to pursue the correct functioning of the market environment and to put pressure on prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to see the very tangible consistency in the response of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Like gas stations, the exact same gas prices are probably just a matter of chance and tough competition.
'The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither of the two providers has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately higher responsibility for its market behaviour.
The telecoms regulator is also likely to lack the tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual operators", Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no other Czech operator is in a leading position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer another approach - the approval of the network operator is always required for the creation of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it's necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning to UOHS that three mobile operators are apparently behaving in a similar way.
The complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in the negotiations with all the service providers.
And blaming the CTU is a relatively common telecommunications ploy that takes the OHS off the case.
We've seen this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, the extension of the CTU's competence in the area of economic competition in the telecommunications sector was not transposed into the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS should know this, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching.
The Czech authorities have not provided any evidence that the Commission has found that the measure is selective.
These companies publish their own price lists for mobile telephony services, but these are only partially public.
Because these are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected ones.
The magic is that the company is the traditional corporate customer, as opposed to the service provider, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a high-value customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-payment.
"If the cases you are talking about were to occur, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company in question", Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
But it is unlikely that any such activity would not have been reported to the responsible persons of the mobile operators.
The three companies in particular may have several thousand customers.
No provider is immune to this type of procedure.
These companies generate a significant profit from their activities and, unlike the real virtual service providers, are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, yet only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name and therefore cannot be fully available to them, as is the case for the general public of mobile operators.'
But that's what the CTU should be getting at least.
In addition, another question arises for the OHIM.
If mobile operators are blind to such a procedure, why are they blocking the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be noted that OHIM has a relatively strong legal mandate to detect such activity and, if it does not wish to do so, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they have not suspected such activity and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most precious
As mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were virtually the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at this point that regulators stepped in, not to protect the interests of the mobile operators, but to protect the interests of their customers.
And then, either through formal measures or through informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual service provider, which was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are handing the whole thing off to each other.
In our experience, we cannot escape the impression that the ambiguous competencies are useful in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider in our country is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators were to allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS could hardly be indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we may not have any more expensive phones than in the rest of Europe.
There are four new versions of the new Czech anthem.
Choose the Best
Listen to four takes of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech Republic Day, solemnly released the new recordings of the national anthem Where Is My Homeland?
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, choir or instrumental.
The song is sung by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The anthem was modified by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNed.cz website lists all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen young, representative vocalists who are expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
"From the very beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and later the orchestra, had a clear diction, a clear understanding, and a harmonious sound", he recalled.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is my country? was first performed in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's play Tyl Fidlovačka, supplemented by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "New" Anthem?
The Prague transport company will deliver for the first time on Wednesday with a chip card
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008 will go down in the history of Prague Transportation Company as the date when the first passenger will board the subway, the tram and the bus with an electronic ticket in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to approximately one hundred thousand holders of Opencard chip cards.
Passengers can purchase 30-day, 90-day and annual coupons (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save them on their chip cards at the information centres and depots of the Transport Corporation at the Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons can be purchased online via the website of the Transportation Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers by this afternoon.
Those who start using e-commerce can forget about the long lines at subway ticket boxes.
The voucher can be purchased online and stored on an Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"At these places, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help them shop online and save their voucher on their card", says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic vouchers will be available for saving on Opencard in some self-serve machines in the lobbies.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket takers, and passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc, and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
The coupon is controlled by an automaton instead of a driver
The machines that start tomorrow are simple to operate.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will automatically be saved.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So on the city's commuter trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which primarily serve residents of the central part of the Czech Republic, travel to the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Prague, the conductors are equipped with card readers that also allow them to check the validity of the coupons", explained Filip Drápal of Ropid, the organisation that compiles the timetable of Prague's public transport.
Buses around the city have card readers built into the driver's seat at the ticket office.
When boarding, the driver must therefore not only show the smart card but also place the Opencard in a designated place on the side of the cash register.
The driver checks the validity of the vouchers.
"For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest thing to do is to ask the driver", Drápal added.
Passengers who are not on city buses and will not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the vending machines that save the vouchers on cards.

The Sudetes wanted a referendum from the U.S.
The Sudeten Germans demanded that Šumava be annexed to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
This is the request that, allegedly, a group of Sudeten Germans made to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is also revealed by a surviving letter from a private archive, now in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Czechs from Česky Krumlov are asking the US president not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" to Czechia, which was occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops are coming to the German territories not as oppressors and enemies but as liberators", the letter reads, "People who bear the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans supposedly - with knowledge of the Czech national character - can only give hope of brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava "now and forever".
"We cannot conceive that, regardless of the opinion of four million of its inhabitants, he would regard this territory as a foreign country to us, oppressing and agitating a minority, and contributing in no small measure to the victory of the Allies", the letter states.
The reason the authors could not sign is allegedly fear of the "Czech oppressors" vengeance.
So if the president of the United States were to say that he doubted the opinion of the Shumawi Germans, all he would have to do is hold a referendum in Shumawi County on whether its residents want to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the letter's text may seem somewhat naive in light of modern postwar history, some historians believe that it accurately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had the slightest idea that they would be expelled from their country, few of them acknowledged the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree to a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others hoped to remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German budějovice during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and sent to the Holštynsko concentration camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they would be good at Czech", Chalupa said.
He said that no one among the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the country on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think, you pay!
The emotional campaign is targeting the leaders
It's the most expensive road safety operation in Czech history.
That's how you'd describe the emotional media campaign that the Department of Transportation is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rěbiček hopes this campaign will deter the leaders from the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million dollar campaign will be on TV, radio, movie theaters, the Internet, and even on flyers.
Drivers should be warned about speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
He wants to speak to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the commercials?
Emotionally offensive, mostly human stories.
This is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
And the bloodstain has the word "pay".
It should be a sign that a moment of inattention can cost a man his life.
Viewers will be "scared" by the commercials until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of accident victims are regularly seen.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go for the drivers
"Drivers are subject to a 'pull and release' system.
For them, 'catch' is when they go through a red light, saving time.
'Pull' means the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
He says the danger signs are less effective.
"If a danger sign is installed, it is likely to blend in quickly with the environment and drivers will not pay attention to it", warned Kořán.
Olmert would give up almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the head of the provisional Israeli government, spoke of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by the Jedi daily Akron.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we have to give back almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of this territory, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that the possible surrender would include East Jerusalem.
"If you want to be safe in Jerusalem and above all not have tractors and bulldozers running over your feet, as one of my best friends did, you have to give up part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in July in two cities that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for "the Temple Mount, the holy and historic sites" in the Old City.
"Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work", he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an essential condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they must give up to take the Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); give up their systematic support for Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) terrorism in Iraq,' the Prime Minister said.
After the accident, is it illegal to have a bus attendant?
The law doesn't recognize them, so they can't ride the long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether the buses could carry passengers and escorts while they were traveling.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the escort is in contradiction with the law on transport activity", says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was likely caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for her, she was seated next to the driver in the least safe seat on the bus, even though two other seats were reserved for her.
A bus can crash or brake suddenly at the very moment when the attendant is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
Whether the bus has a parking space according to the traffic permit is relevant.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The buses of the Student Agency do not have a parking space, which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
"We tried to find a solution with the Ministry, and at first they didn't allow the movement of passengers.
However, this was withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can use the toilet during the journey, provided they have their own seat", he said.
The law doesn't recognize a flight attendant.
'There is no clear legal definition of the role of a flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing the services.
The law on road traffic only defines the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define his rights and obligations", adds the spokesman of Hanzelka, who is less clear.
Josef Pokorný, director of the road vehicle operation department of the Ministry of Transport, on the other hand, believes that the law is handling the problem properly.
"Depends on whether the bus has a parking space on the licence.
And that's the end of it", he says.
Buses may be urban, with stops and limited maximum speed, and intercity buses with stops and permitted higher speeds, and long-distance buses without stops and permitted higher speeds, with seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, traffic safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem with the movement of the escorts on board the bus.
"There is little danger in moving forward, and the situation is comparable to that of a flight attendant.
"It's not safe here when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit her head".
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, the laws of physics apply.
Just like the city buses and the trams.
The safety of the escorts must be ensured by the carrier's internal rules", he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura ready to end services
The Student Agency is the only bus operator offering escort services.
He employs 200 flight attendants.
The director doesn't consider their jobs risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of a flight attendant is risky, I'll take it out.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save money", he says.
The lack of flight attendants in his vehicles was explained by security concerns by Alexei Litvin, the director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have escorts, we've been opposed to this from the start.
Sooner or later it ends up with some kind of fatal injury", he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from Plzeň, who had been working for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck, probably without using a direction indicator, turned off the lane and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly maneuvered to avoid the bus, but the right front of the bus struck him.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's decision to open the formal investigation procedure was based on the information provided by the interested parties.
"These places are not booked on long-haul flights, they're blocked".
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
In compensating the family of your daughter, the agency is not waiting for a court decision, but is also expecting financial compensation from the perpetrator.
Amendment to the law?
In the distant future
The precise movement of the passengers on board the bus could mean the change in the law, which has been working for more than a year by the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"The group, however, did not reach any concrete results.
Buses are not so much about speed limits on the motorway, but about the use of mobile phones while driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the bus attendants to be a fundamental threat to the safety of the passengers", concludes Hanzelka, adding that the police and the employment offices are responsible for controlling the safety of buses.
The hopes of Dusseldorf are passing in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB management to the bank's employees is full of words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf financial institution and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group", says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable 'competence block' into such a business.
Such a link could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its mettle in a time of crisis.
The pressure on WestLB, which is in a precarious position, is still immense.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Supervision Authority, which recently informed the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is a limited deadline for finding a lasting solution.
For savings bank customers, however, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has long been discussed, including the Frankfurt part.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, already stated at the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly data, that he did not see the merger of the Mainzer Landstraße bank and a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB as making any sense.
Nevertheless, the Deka board of directors, composed of representatives of the Landesbanks and the Savings Banks' Association, instructed the board to negotiate joint business with WestLB.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts thereof.
But the negotiations, financial circles say, have only just begun.
Deka-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the major employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the hedge fund sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But this threefold alliance was not to be.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a relationship between Deca-Bank and the provincial banks was raised again and again.
However, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, recently spoke out against the merger plans with the bank.
Nevertheless, there is a recognition of the need for different public sector banks to approach each other.
Now, following the Bavarian state elections, the first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
As the pressure for further mergers increases, it may run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, only young entrepreneurs could be considered, even though they have so far far far fared considerably better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart in surviving the financial crisis.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out earlier this year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which had an 85% stake in Helaba.
It is better to leave NordLB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings and Loan Association had not yet answered the crucial question of the business model that should secure the future of the Landesbanken.
Finally, the possible dismantling of WestLB is still possible, but it is obvious that this is not what they want.
So the letter from the local board of directors says that they are certainly seeking a "complete solution".
How that's going to be reconciled with the merger of the individual units with Deka Bank is still a matter of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend".
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, alongside the Kaiser five-liter barrel, a man with a stout beard demonstrates to some 200 Oktoberfest-goers how deeply he can produce sounds from his throat.
Elena first caresses Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From there, from the bus station next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart at 23.45 for the "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" with an expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, the fourth for Brazilians only.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing along with their flag, and during the night, they began to celebrate.
And so loud that it's not for Italians", says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, faux fur-lined coat and wide silver-rimmed glasses.
He's been taking you to Oktoberfest for five years. He's arranged three trips this year.
Going there at night, going to Oktoberfest at daylight, coming home at 10.30.
The accommodation would be a waste of money, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Law, accident insurance and a tour guide in German - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already plunging into the night on the highway towards the "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus soon becomes quiet, the passengers sleep.
That's good, they'll need their strength.
They're having a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several Italian buses on the Highway 8 are also taking a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven, as scheduled, there are already nearly 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last briefing, explaining the war plan.
First, everyone put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of the letter, the inscription reads "Oktoberfest" in broken letters, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscerviagando.it".
Second, "When the beer tent opens, run", Marco says into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, we'll get stuck, and not all the yellow hats will sit on the same bench, but spread out in the tent".
A gallon of this stuff costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget about the tip.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving yourself.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll be taken".
Third, "Be back here tonight at exactly half past ten". You got that?
And now for the Wiesn.
On the way, one man uses yellow hats as signs to tie up trees, signs, and even a large Bavarian party election poster.
We must prepare for retreat.
It's the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; they talk about 50,000 people crossing the Alps in beer bottles, and it is said that ten percent of all weekend visitors come from Italy.
The police in Aachen are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, and the Bavarian Red Cross is assisted by Italian volunteers. With around 200 medical services, the Italians are in first place in the national statistics, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60), who are at the bottom of the list.
The Hofbräu beer cellar was especially popular among the Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, as Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even inserted into his statement that the German banking sector is not spared from crisis-like developments.
Because that's what happened this weekend.
The Munich real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on Daxon, has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan guarantees amounted to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it has used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
The state-funded Depfa, according to a newspaper report, has lent money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for extremely short-term maturities - which is no longer possible due to the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its own capital ratio decreased moderately from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current revenue and net revenue from cash transactions were down to zero compared with the same period of the previous year, while revenue from credit-to-claim and securities transactions and the liquidation of loan business provisions fell by more than 70%, to EUR 5 million.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
The former State-owned bank had, after privatisation in 1990, been speculating in corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently divested in Aeral Bank.
As the traditional public financing did not generate much revenue, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in private-public partnerships (PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the State had provided any evidence that the State had provided the State with the necessary information.
The fact is that there was no payment of dividends.
The dividend was already reduced by one third for 2007.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Greek authorities on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
It is more dependent on the interbank market for refinancing than other financial institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
The collapse of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank in the U.S. two weeks ago, has slowed the flow of credit between banks, because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets every year to refinance part of Depfa's loan portfolio, amounting to some EUR 50 billion.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the capital increase was necessary to cover the capital needs of the group.
Other sources claim that the funds will ensure that the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of HRE, however, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets for a considerable time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the market viability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
It gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But the dynamics and immeasurable nature of the crisis cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that the funding should not be used in full.
But the opposite of that cannot be ruled out.
With the bank still on the brink of bankruptcy, even a temporary bailout could not calm the spirits.
The stock price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, by contrast, are holding up quite well.
While the debt ranked first is barely changing, the rates of the bonds ranked last have declined significantly.
The crisis particularly affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and the maturities extending considerably beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their stability is now seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the intensification of the banking crisis and the financial institution's near-domestication of the crisis by taking over Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still willing to support the scheme, the timely repayment of the fees can be a starting point.
Or we'll have what almost no one is hoping for right now, which is that we'll have a financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports concerning partial nationalisation, the probability of a near certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to divest their investment can cause sleepless nights.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use the sale to create a reserve for taxes due on exchange gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inner Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana High School on her first day of classes, the girls start yelling: "The German girl is a total "kavia"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - the new exchange blog talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was so high on the way to school.
I live outside of Tokyo, in Kawasaki, and it takes me 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, but luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that starting teaching at Tachibana is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to gather at eight o'clock, until a brief conversation with the teacher, the "home room", begins at 8:40 o'clock.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my landlady, a blouse, blue knee-highs and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the chair in this costume, trying to pronounce everything correctly: "Szajonara, vo ne Sylvana "... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word "kavaí".
I've seen that in my manga.
It's a basic Japanese girl's word, and it means "sweet, sweet".
Then I quickly got back to my seat.
The girl sitting next to me smiled broadly, and was honored to have the exchange students sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they were running straight.
Everyone was talking and laughing in a confused way, and their questions made me sick - and it is quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everyone unpacked their underwear.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's not like those boring German Tiso sandwich.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, a salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit, and a kind of tofu-meat roll.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and tastes completely new.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well, except maybe the salty plum-coated one, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the dining room is more than just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl will give a boy a homemade undergarment, which she will put together in a very artistic way - hoping that she will get to know him better during lunchtime.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it just fascinates me".
After all, for years, my favorite book has been manga.
And to understand comics and the culture they represent, I started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me that I had to come here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and custom.
And these are highly valued here.
Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends - but also of strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a mole runs away when threatened. Does that mean that it feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have feelings too.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
The online journal "The Edge" has been publishing articles by famous scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE published a series of answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it, and it's probably true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
But when we're looking at other species, and we're looking at issues of perception or consciousness in general, it's hard to get into the field because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do - it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
Humans behave in ways that some researchers have found to be comparable to subjective experience.
I don't believe that.
There are two aspects of brain structure that make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits related to human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This broad area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as our sense of who we are, or our ability to plan and make decisions, there's a reasonable assumption that we're different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature of human linguistic nature is that since a great deal of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not dependent on language, it would certainly be affected by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to tell what consciousness might be like in other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as something internal and subjective, and because of special hardware, it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research presents us with a serious problem.
Most of my thinking is about the content of conscious experience, but there's another aspect of consciousness that is probably easier for science to access.
The conscious processes of animals could be studied without regard to their content, and this is precisely what happens in experiments on short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, this hypothesis, also explored by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on neural contexts of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: They may be identical, or they may not be.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the formation of visualization.
What does this tell us about our emotions?
I'm going to take this to the point where an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the conscious mind.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies working memory.
So emotion is very closely related to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to linguistic character, perception is subtle because words and grammar allow us to distinguish and categorize states, to describe them to others as well as to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from the simpler activities of the cortex and the cortex body sensing areas, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the cortex.
Since this network hasn't changed much in human evolution, it could easily play a role in emotions across species.
I can't disprove it in theory, but I can't prove it.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be fear in both: How can we check if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away when in danger, but does it feel fear?
In my opinion, similar behavior alone is not evidence of the same experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further, rats and humans have similar brainstems, but cockroaches don't have brains.
But the brain stem is responsible for emotions?
And even if we could prove this in humans, how could we prove this in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their emotions are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm studying the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
However, progress in this area has been made at the neural level, as long as we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Just as I'm not looking for language or consciousness in rats, I'm not looking for emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bumping into walls.
I'm practically an emotional person.
Platini, UEFA President: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
'The government sees in the UEFA Bordeaux decision the confidence in Ukraine and the belief that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship together with Poland,' Vasunic said.
"But this is not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries".
Both host countries are lagging behind in terms of construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now", said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us".
In Poland, they were going to take a more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee has suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which has been replaced by independent commissioner Robert Zawlocki, following a series of scandals.
The committee met at the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have written to assure the UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the UEFA Euro 2012".
Only in the last season, several first league teams had to be relegated due to manipulation, and finally the league start had to be postponed.
The outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
The actress was supposed to promote a new film, and in an interview, she talked about her private life, and now she's having a falling out with her ex-husband, Meg Ryan, who has described her former husband, Dennis Quaid, as an adulterer.
♪ Who's gonna take it and hit back ♪
The two Hollywood actors are engaged in a bitter fight seven years after their divorce - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan first spoke about the divorce in an interview with InStyle magazine last week, saying, "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it caused a lot of pain".
And it wasn't until after the divorce that she found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her with.
The psychic striptease was triggered by Ryan's press release about his new film, "Women", which tells the story of an adulterous relationship.
Dennis Quaid reacted strongly to his accusation of being an unfaithful husband: "It's horrible", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is endlessly repeating and re-telling the story of our relationship".
It is also "sad" that 16-year-old sons Jack and Jack are "repeatedly reminded publicly of the many pain and changes that divorce brings to a child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
So his reply ends with the following footnote: "My life is going on anyway.
I am blessed to have a wonderful family in which everything is in order".
Prices for airline tickets and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European airlines and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
A recent study showed that air travel in Germany has become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Airfare and hotel room rates have been made more affordable again, according to a study by American Express, a travel and financial services company.
The company analysed the booking data for the first half of 2008 and, following the first quarter price increase, recorded a significant price decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, accommodations in many places have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared with 2007.
However, the period from April to June already saw prices 3.6% lower than the previous year.
This trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this in the low dollar exchange rate, which has led to "a waning travel mood among American tourists".
The decline in hotel room prices is more pronounced in financial centres such as Frankfurt and London than in industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
The Norwegian city has a hotel rate increase of 26.3 percent, which is a European record.
The first quarter also saw an upward trend in airfares.
The increase in kerosene cost caused passengers to pay an average of 7.1 percent more in economy class than in 2007, and long-haul fuel-intensive flights increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, economy class prices decreased by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, while business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
Prices in Germany have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
The study shows that the cost of domestic flights in Germany has been cut in half.
The company claims that the reason for the price decrease is partly the slowing down of economic growth.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air travel between the USA and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is evidenced by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines and the bankruptcy of several airlines in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach by one to zero.
With one goal and simple tactics, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
Luhukay at Borussia still can't find a workable team.
Kristoffer Klein is magnifying Deep Flying for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was late in the game and his pick-up was bouncing off the goal line.
His exact wording left a convincing impression.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway leading to the Hamburg Arena booths.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the pause ended, and most of the people were back in their seats.
Rieger was the physiotherapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying more prestige than some of the players of his time.
So your request was heard in the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and unanimously held up his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg head coach, Martin Jol.
His order was something like, "Here's the second goal".
The order was not carried out.
"Today was not always a beautiful day", later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "imagined" the situation more easily.
The 1-0 (1:0) goal difference was due to the Hamburgers' Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that the very weak gladbachs could not inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the billboard on the screen that showed their team as the championship's class winners.
This is going to be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it", said Marcell Jansen.
He thinks the tabella's mid-season certificate is more a sign of the league's unpredictability than of HSV's dominance.
Although the team is slowly recovering thanks to the late commitment of its players - Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen, acquired from FC Bayern - it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and more persuasion", Jol insisted.
After the vote
Wall Street is in fear.
With the first news of the bailout's collapse, the Dow Jones temporarily fell 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
And then the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down a good 5 percent, at 10,579.
The Nasdaq, which trades technology securities, dropped more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest loser in the Dow at this point was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with a 12% loss.
None of the papers have strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank shares are down nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett, the investor, had bought a stake in the bank.
The rescue measure is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called 'dubious mortgages'.
However, they do not want to pay the amount all at once, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive stock option vouchers from the financial institutions, which could be redeemed if the exchange rates were favourable, reducing the burden on the State Treasury.
European and US stock prices in descending order
Billions in aid to European and American banks are not dispelling investors' doubts.
The stock of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is plummeting, and it's taking Dax with it.
The Dow Jones is in decline despite the government's planned bailout of the financial markets.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German equity index (Dax) deeply into the negative.
The value of shares of the Munich real estate financing company, despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, fell by a quarter, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax dropped below the psychologically important 6,000 point mark, scoring a 3.7 percent minus with a score of 5,839.
Stock markets around the world have been forced to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, a 3.3% drop to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to approve the bailout plan, and the Senate is expected to vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges followed suit: in London, the FTSE index fell 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index dropped 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after an initial rally.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
The Sensex index of India dropped to 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
Arcandor's shares on the Mdax exchange fell after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheimer has listed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said that the shares of Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter is affecting the flight of space probes.
A mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers for years, dark matter interfering with the speed of space probes during what is known as a swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity may not be completely correct.
The Ulysses space probe has been in space for nearly 18 years.
He's in danger of death by frostbite from the soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a spacecraft's gravitational swaying of a body, such as Earth, to gain additional momentum.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe, like the Ulysses probe, also used this physical trick.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is that flying objects don't behave exactly as expected by ancient gravity.
Instead, there are anomalies in the velocity.
The probes are either accelerating or slowing down unexpectedly.
Physicists have yet to find an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which views gravity as a curvature of space, may not be completely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, remains adamant that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly by the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may be found even in the vicinity of the Earth", writes Adler.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space explorers for a decade.
It's obviously exerting a gravitational force that can be seen to be exerting an effect on other celestial bodies.
But the material itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists Kidnapped in Egypt Rescued
After spending ten days in the custody of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister has confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers have demanded millions of euros in ransom.
Six hostage takers are reported to have been killed in a shootout that preceded the hostage release.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
This was reported in unison by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arabic and Italian media.
Italian television Sky TG 24 reported that Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and other hostages have been released.
We are currently monitoring their health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian passengers are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the pre-release shooting remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage takers had already expressed a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprised them by killing six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom", the official said.
"The hostage negotiations were about to begin when suddenly the surprise came".
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers and arrested two on Sunday at the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "al-Masri al-Jom" quoted a German media outlet as saying that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers will release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they can find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to comment on the report.
Stepfather's Violence "led to Suicide"
It was said in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been abusing her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, spent six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of attempted aggravated rape.
The St. Louis Criminal Court has learned that he routinely bound his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of her confessions, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for his death".
It was reported at the trial that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in the Mutley area of Plymouth on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and blindfolded her before intercourse, while her mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise divorced her husband in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, it was revealed during the court hearing that Miss Randle, who had spent much of her life as a volunteer with the National Trust, was haunted by the horrors of rape, which occurred twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been a passionate surfer and cyclist, was described by friends as "emotionally dead" and "lost in life".
In April 2007, she was found dead in her Plymouth apartment by her father, Terrance Randle.
Probably choked himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a falling-out with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his confession in a letter: "I always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was horrible for your victim, especially since she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family affair ended with the victim committing suicide.
What is even more sobering is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have gone to court".
The judge added: "I would like to draw your attention to the effect that Stephanie's parents have felt your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
If that had not happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful, happy young woman".
The official who lost important data has been charged
The BBC has learned that a government official is being charged with breaching official secrecy for leaving top secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on an expert assignment from the Department of Defense when he left behind two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the most basic charge of violating the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional homicide.
Frank Gardner, the BBC's correspondent for the Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
"It was believed that the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which covers the retention of information.
The prosecution has proposed that the case against the clerk be brought by the Metropolitan Police on the grounds of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee, which is of a rather sensitive nature.
The documents he lost included classified surveys on Al Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi military.
They were informed of the decision on Monday, and then he was moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B's bill
UK housing associations are facing a bill of over £80 million following the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government has spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that use the money of the deposit holders, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "exciting" that the societies and their members had to pay.
The repayment of the loan of 14 billion pounds will finally take place after the repayment of the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing associations were among them.
It is a pity that institutions which have been prudent in the past ... are now having to pay the bills of institutions which were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA, is the man who's gonna be the next president.
We learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the escrow amount they hold, and the companies share 18% of the cost between them.
The Treasury estimates the loan to be worth £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to set aside £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Building Companies Union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is appalling that these institutions have to pay the bills of far less cautious institutions that acted cautiously during the booming housing market".
According to BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since it started operations in 1945.
"We will have to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to decide how to protect the housing associations and their members from a significant bill", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, you'll have to pay a full year's interest, which could be twice what it is now.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations, without shareholders, the members must eventually pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk goes up five pence a litre.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by five pence a gallon starting Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and following a survey by a consulting firm.
The resellers themselves decide whether to pass on the price increase to the consumer.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey was last changed in 2002.
Former Member of Parliament of Bangladesh's request to be allowed to defend himself in open court has been rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for the release of former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court had denied him bail on charges that he extorted $50 million in coverage ($729,700) from a businessman during his time in Parliament.
This case is just one of the many corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country's military-backed interim government grant her full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions of his release did not clearly state whether he would be able to retain his freedom when he returned to the country.
His lawyers say he's now going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appellate court.
"The appeals court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application, saying it was unnecessary as she has been temporarily released and is undergoing medical treatment abroad", lawyer Rafique-ul Huq told us.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal".
His lawyers argue that he needs to be protected on the highway so he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 Afghan children were excluded from the recently organized polio vaccination program because of violence related to the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesman said that this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or interfere with the work of thousands of vaccinators.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV dismissed
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its stake in the rival broadcaster ITV was dismissed.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
Earlier, the Commission found that BSkyB's shareholding was a distortion of competition and gave it undue influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV threatened the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin's CEO, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom watchdog all opposed the takeover.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV shareholding was a meaningless and disproportionate compensation - especially in view of BSkyB's declaration that it would be willing to surrender its voting rights.
The U.S. Attorneys' case is being re-examined
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move followed a report by the Chief Justice's Inspector General on the case that criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because he was afraid that the prosecutors had been dismissed for political considerations.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation attempted to obstruct justice by lying.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal activity have not been investigated or resolved", said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify.
The series began in December 2006 with the dismissal of nine state attorneys general by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, it was said that the state's attorneys were fired for poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the sacked prosecutors were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many to conclude that the firings were politically motivated.
Some state attorneys participated in the criminal prosecutions of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others refused to participate in the investigation of the allegations of election fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are government employees who investigate and prosecute cases.
They can go at any time, but they can't be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks by the Attorney General over the layoffs and eventually resigned.
Several other officials in the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the case, saying that the Attorney General had "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, had "forgotten" his role as controller, and had "apparently excluded himself" from the process.
He's criticizing other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to Bush Sr., for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic is receiving acclaim
Rock star Meat Loaf will be receiving recognition at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will be receiving the special golden award at the London ceremony next week, said he was honored to receive the award.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty-five seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 greatest hits album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, coming in at number four on the list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross time or genre boundaries, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is one of those".
The song that Jim Steinman had written was a very big song, and that was Meat Loaf.
The song began with a nearly two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell", however, stayed on the charts for almost nine years and still sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been battling health issues, including having heart surgery in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute bronchitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It turned out that there was a cyst on the vocal cords.
An unknown city street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, roundabouts, and other side streets, some of them famous, others merely functional.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time local residents would have difficulty telling where Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village, and it runs north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 30 feet wide and 100 feet long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a major thoroughfare.
There are no street signs.
It's practically impossible to find on a standard map.
But the street has its admirers.
There's Avalon Bay, for example, the builder of the newly built luxury First Street.
He wants to re-cover Extra Place and make sure that the shops and boutiques in the new buildings are accessed by a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are long-time neighbors who were struck by the fact that it was the only remnant of the area's pre-renovation past.
But the owner of the street, the city's Department of Building Preservation and Development, has no interest in sticking with it.
This month, at a meeting of the district's zoning commission, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal to the developer to buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer that the street remain under city control and has asked for a new plan to be submitted by next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district manager of Municipal Board No. 3.
"There are very few properties that are owned by the city, and we want Extra Place to remain city property", he said.
"There are suggestions for restoration and maintenance that Avalon may undertake, but we also want to ensure that it remains accessible to the public".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would re-cover the alley and provide seating for a coffee shop, part of which the developer is expected to lease.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first brought up at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't insist on owning it.
"The main objective of Avalon Bay is to restore this devastated neighborhood and turn it into a pleasant public space", he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the bureau's job is to improve buildings, not to maintain them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
Some say that the name "no man's land" was coined in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his numerous children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
Closed in 2006, the punk-rock landmark CBGB's back exit opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for being the location of the cover photo of the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"It was a terrible place", said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, dress slips, barrels and poster pieces, as well as wall sheets and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how the middle class took over the East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the hands of the community.
Others speak of Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "Siralmak's Book: A Bitter Nostalgia on the City's Dying Process"), posted on his blog a portion of the story of Extra Place that appeared in the weekly The New Yorker in 1952 in the column "Rumor of the Year".
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small cul-de-sac that is dark even in the daytime, bordered by rusted iron storage doors and sashed windows, and where weekly newspapers are carried in the wind in the gutters".
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same as it did a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street from the back door that used to lead to CBGB, now belongs to the high-end clothing store that was built on the site.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty, three-gallon beer bottle lying next to a discarded stack of fresh newspapers.
Some of the passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could use a makeover.
Fields said he thought some people underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp, and disgusting places", he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment
In this episode of Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow for California Studies and director of educational research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice".
It's not easy to please the voters from the Spanish-speaking areas.
And that includes Barack Obama's education proposals.
The Obama campaign says that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and that's true.
To overcome such differences in performance, the Obama education plan explicitly supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
But for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English language education in schools, overrides his interest in tackling the large achievement gaps.
Take the Sixth Street Prep charter school in East Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Hispanic and low-income.
More than one third of the students - many of whom are newcomers - are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of fourth graders scored excellent marks in the 2008 state math test.
Equally impressive, 93% of fourth graders scored A's in English Language and Literature.
They didn't achieve this incredible feat with the tools that Obama would have preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills and the rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is something Obama should consider, Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, says the school's educational policy is to "fully immerse" English-language students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching the other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We had a great success in that if you walked into a classroom, you wouldn't know who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier".
"It works", he said, "it works for us".
Would Obama put schools like Sixth Street Prep ahead of other schools that have a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students?
The school's achievements should make the answer clear, but because of his own party's education policy (the National Education Association has long supported bilingual education), and since he himself is a consistent advocate of bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a disparaging statement on the issue when he said that people should not worry so much about the "exclusive Englishness" of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should get their kids to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to reduce the disparity in performance, he should really study the models that work, rather than just dismissing them and dismissing them.
Renewed economic concerns have caused a sharp drop in oil prices
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, amid fears that the US bailout of financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares are down seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and a few powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before being hit again by the extreme volatility in financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again worried, even after congressional leaders announced that they had agreed on the biggest economic rescue in history this weekend.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis was not over for a long time.
In the latest development in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking arm of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts say that as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "the bailout appears to have failed to revive the stock market mood".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities such as oil is expected to decline.
"The future of the equity, interest rate and currency exchange markets has become uncertain worldwide", wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the commodities market will not escape the 'epidemic' either.
The biggest question from a commodity-economic point of view is the extent to which the US "disease" is infecting the whole world, especially China".
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts slashed their expectations for the coming year, cutting their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
With a second-quarter brawl, the team set a new school record.
After spending more time in the Jets' uniform than anyone else over the past eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
But then he saw the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a no-hit game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began with the Jets and Arizona Cardinals playing to a slow-pitch match against the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, setting the stage for an afternoon in which their budding partnership has evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including two back-to-back cornerbacks that were down 10 seconds before halftime.
"I didn't regret the trouble", Favre said of all the passes he gave Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've always been able to communicate well, regardless of what people think".
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense stopped the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, the cornerback, caught a bad throw and threw it back for 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety, he's got another pass and he's got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
That last turn would have been the most exciting move of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball with 10 seconds left and the Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the game at 34-0.
That's the best score the Jets have ever had in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the game's distraction, he said, "In the second or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter and the Jets scored none - Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
We've scored a lot of points in a short time".
The restless Gebrselassie is about to break her own world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why he is considered by many to be the best middle- and long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first person to run the 26.2 kilometers in two hours and four minutes.
With a comfortable victory in a flat track in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set 26 career world records in a variety of distances, winning world championships or setting world records in almost every distance from the 1,500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon for fear that air pollution might worsen his asthmatic problems, which may have been an over-cautious step in retrospect.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, with temperatures of 9°C at the beginning and 13°C at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since marathon runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya, who had never run before, switched to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, he had a sprain in both legs and hadn't been able to exercise for two weeks.
It's clear that during the forced rest, you were refreshed and not intoxicated.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters. "I'm so happy that you are here.
"Everything was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but everything worked out fine".
He has received some criticism - particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - that he uses too many props in his races, generally avoids many world-class marathoners, relies on his sprints as if he were running on a track, and places world records before the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie, with the help of four Kenyan sprinters, crossed the finish line in 1:02:04.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the pace to Gebrselassie after the pace runners ran out of fuel.
With just over three miles (4.8 km) to go, Gebrselassie overtook Kwambai in a final sprint, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan and now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh-fastest time of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, won the London Marathon by a surprising 2:24:14.
He was unable to compete at the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but he recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved by five minutes in the individual peak, the third marathon distance he competed in.
He won the race by clever calculation: first, he let a four-man group of Ethiopians and Kenyans break through and take a considerable lead, then he chased after them for about 20 miles [30 km].
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second with a time of 2:21.31 while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third with a time of 2:25.01.
A Separate City, Black Pride and the Trials of the Black
In the sprawling theme park of Greater Orlando -- a few miles from everything that's shiny, loud and mighty -- lurks a quiet little town that is the birthplace of the pride and complexity of the African-American experience.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to be incorporated into the country, and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guajas and two schools, no jail".
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, a series of celebrations in Eatonville in honour of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction - which is also featured in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers Project for the Crisis Era - is distinct from its surroundings.
It was as independent, dignified, and closed-minded as it was in the 1930's, when, Hurston writes, Florida's urban blacks were often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people who "knew so little about us that they didn't know what they were missing".
Even in the year that black presidential candidate Barack Obama is promoting his open discussion of race, many here are wary of outsider gazes.
"We are very careful about how we tell our story", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident of the town and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be said properly".
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
It's a historic model of black resistance, but it's also a community of almost 2,400 people with poverty rates twice the national average.
Part literary hub, part exemplar of the sometimes-deprecated, sometimes-praised, Southern urban black culture that flourished in the shade of oak trees, the result of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the people here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (here everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in a frank, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five sections of the Florida Book of Roads have transformed the city, which lies alongside Route 17, a road that leads from the long-forgotten heart of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was as brave as a drum in life and literature, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to the more trusting spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, on a brown ground with a white border, with well-kept yards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller looks after, though he can scarcely read or write".
She mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of liquor and anything you need in temporary accommodations".
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly, Fodor's guide presented it differently.
That description really didn't appeal to everyone.
"Zora told the truth", related Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls whom Hurston immortalized by quoting the silly songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as the lively oddball who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a dashing Chevy, with cigarettes and long pants, in a city where people still take pride in their dignified dress.
Most people were fascinated by it, Franklin said, but many were disgusted.
"People were always happy to see Zora", said Franklin.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, rocking his chair: "He never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were out of print.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, had forgotten about him.
Although she was once a popular author, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us", said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography "Cloaked in a Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
Expansion in Orlando has already begun to penetrate Interstate 4 on the city's western border.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950's, the race-mixing struggles of the community were a taste of hate.
"At that time a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at people sitting on the sidewalk", Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died in it.
"They threw a turkey out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to mandate forced integration, saying of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, "It is more insulting than respectful of my race".
Now, residents say that while the desegregation of the schools was positive in some ways, it weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of the young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - the teacher was hugged in the morning and in the evening", reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit organization We're Watching the Community of Eatonville.
"This continued as long as the students and the teachers were from the same place", he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because she was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us", Nathiri said.
But human rights helped to lift up many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudice, as she did, with such visionary confidence and lines as, "How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company!
It's beyond my comprehension".
In 1975, Alice Walker walked into Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a biography of Robert E. Hemenway, a well-known biographer of Hurston, was placed on bookstore shelves, once again elevating him to the status of an American exemplar.
The road project was about to begin as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as their savior.
In 1988, the community began organizing a Hurston Festival to show what would ruin the county's highway system.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the celebration every January since.
A few years later, the county rejected the proposed road.
"The five-lane highway has brought the community back to life, to full speed, and that's a real civic pride", Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply, "Eatonville was saved by the storm".
The victory over the road project helped change the city's self-image.
With more and more out-of-towners showing up, like lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started attending the church in 1993, the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (naturally named after Hurston) opened on the renovated and embellished Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cockatoo: it's less than 10 miles from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban back street in the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They're still wary of outsiders coming here looking for the story of Eatonville to tell.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, painted by a white man and depicting black men working the land - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville - including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly drawn to the vibrant red - fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew in stature, so did the pride of the town.
Young people in particular are increasingly seeing Eatonville the way Hurston saw his own race: as wonderful, with problems and everything, neither better nor worse, just as proud, creative, industrious, foolish and confused as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
There is a genuine civic commitment in the voices of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job with the local government or the police, which he believes are in need of help.
And it seems that the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, as did the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who pass through here think this town is nothing compared to the others", said Alondra Kenon recently after church on a Sunday.
"But if you stop and take a little time to learn about its history, it's a very nice city".
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstands and the giant TVs in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a big storm.
They would never know that with glass walls and honeycombed offices overhead, the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York are having their worst day since 1929.
The couriers still drive their metal tea carts down the sidewalks, carrying trays laden with muffins to breakfast meetings.
Still, Spanish-speaking men roam the blockhouses, carrying as if they were human donkeys fifty iron-plated shirts, hanging from their shoulders on a yoke-like hook.
Office workers still line up for their breakfast at the sidewalk food trucks, and it's still impossible to get a cab between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I had deliberately planned to do this during my lunch hour at the local branch of my bank, JP Morgan Chase, but there were already about 20 people in the line ahead of me.
Not at the cashier's window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me - I later learned from Star, the banker "assigned to me" - lined up with the same intention as I had.
But unlike me, they've already taken their money out of smaller banks in their home state, like the New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and supposedly treat their customers like family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went bust quietly.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a buyer with $440 billion in savings.
The office workers and shopkeepers in front of me, fearing another collapse, had moved their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, the bank that does most of the capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
In the past few weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have become experts in finance.
A woman at the local Chinese department store called in about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its oversized CEO, Dick Fuld, as if to complain about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform from the back of my apartment, the 50-year-old tramp, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery, as we usually do.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I put all my savings in money market assets.
I've changed my mind, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria tilts to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, where the organization "Vendors to Counter the Islamic Conquest" was introduced.
They were drawn with signs that imitated traffic signs that depicted mosques with red lines drawn across them.
Police believe far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of a Muslim cemetery in Austria, which occurred on the same weekend that far-right parties made significant gains in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged in the Trauni cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe to be an organized action.
The perpetrators used spray paint to paint Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators believe that this was an attempt to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is connected in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" to hear of the desecration of the grave, which occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a soul-searching in the wake of yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the political balance of power shifted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labelled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, which won over 18% of the vote, also expressed his dislike for the campaign against headscarves and burqas, and for food that is allegedly linked to Islam.
At its final congress in Vienna, the party spoke of "European brotherhood" to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing espionage of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analysis conducted immediately after the far-right victory suggested that the change was due to a largely young voter base who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign tour.
Garry Glitter, convicted child rapist, known rock star, has been banned from traveling in France and Spain.
The judges ruled in favour of a six-month ban on Glitter after he notified his controlling authorities of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after presenting evidence to the court of convictions for child molestation against Glitter.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates' Court, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September Kent Police filed a petition in Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person".
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he was required to do so by the Sex Offender Registration Act.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also required to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you don't inform the authorities, you could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police have said they don't want to discuss his individual cases in Glitter County and his possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police Department told us: "The Kent Police Department does everything it can to protect children at home and abroad.
'We think it is easier to check someone if they do not leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to deal with potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent Police consider it their primary responsibility to protect the people of Kent. "Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders and those living in the county to minimise any risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
However, he claimed that he was unwell and was unwilling to fly to London.
The authorities in the country refused to allow her to pass the passport check, so she eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry into the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the overseas police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22nd and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge court in west London, having been entered on the sex offenders' register by court order, at the request of Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously served four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting child rape.
A Home Office source says Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, has welcomed with relief the fact that Glitter has been denied entry to France and Spain.
"I don't take the photographs on stage because I want to show the artist from a personal point of view".
There's no set, no hair, and no dance shoes.
The great masters of flamenco, without the excitement of the performance, to see the dancers' everyday faces.
The artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, the common man.
And the two sides cannot be separated, except in those intimate moments, far from the audience, when we can touch a personal movement, capture the depth of a gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the expression of an artist who is not preparing to perform on stage.
In his series Flamenco-people, Günther Bauer of Germany combines the theatricality of the singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known, everyday side of the masters.
Through the photographs, he presents the unique iconography of flamenco from different angles.
The exhibition, part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international significance of flamenco", says the artist, adding that the Flamenco-people "can be anyone, because the images make the observer realize that these images do not represent the artists in a typical way.
These people who are on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not the best way to capture their personalities.
Their personality and character are at the very core of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco players with the camera".
The Cante de las Minas Festival gave Bauer the impetus to embark on a long journey in 1997, during which he took portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a flat camera.
This portrait, thanks to the camera and the choice of subject, evokes classic photography.
The use of different stylistic devices, however, breaks with traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following thought reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "It is a music with traditional roots, but one that changes from day to day and is always fascinating".
It is not the dance, nor the singing or the music itself, but rather the personality, the character of the artist that captivates the audience.
The main motive of the works that can be seen today in the El Fotómata Gallery is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic illusion, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
The names of well-known flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the names of this collection of photographs, which features almost sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published as an album of portraits presented at the exhibition.
Two years ago, his passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea with the "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is a bit different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter into their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult art of photography is the portrait.
People you meet, personalities you meet, people you don't even know, or people who just want to take a picture for a few minutes.
But despite these circumstances, I'm still trying to make my dreams come true as a photographer.
The exhibition Flamenco-people, a selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, is on view until 16 October in the El Fotómata Gallery, located in calle de la Mata 20, which runs parallel to the Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "a complete recklessness"
The setting and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is working on a new novel, the main character of which is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who has lived for twenty years in the Congo and has also travelled the Amazon.
The writer, who is up for the Nobel Prize in Literature, admitted at the Hay Festival in Segovia yesterday that his current work is "a total daredevil" and that "all indications are that it should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it someday", he said at the end of a four-day festival of ideas, exchanges and exchange that brought hundreds of writers, historians and journalists to Aqueduct, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary festival and he has lived up to the expectations.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award, voted for by the participants, for an old edition of Dickens' novel Our Common Friend, which was performed in the Juan Bravo Theater.
After the toast of Félix Romeo, the audience was greeted by a devoted audience, and the hour was soon over for the Peruvian writer to tell with a marvelous memory and a great deal of humor how his writing career had developed from his special passion for reading and from his desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with his disciplined writing methods, meticulous documentation, correction and rewriting; how his writing had influenced Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories his stories are based on.
The Latin-American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or demonstrate that books change our lives, but added: "I do not think that literature is mere entertainment or a wildlife experience", since it affects people and makes them think, and therefore he asked writers not to succumb to the temptation of ease and to take responsibility for their profession.
The weather is so bad that the Pozoblanco farewell is shortened, and the bullfights are canceled.
The traditional bullfight, which was the closing event of the Pozoblanco festivities, was cancelled yesterday morning after the future bullfighters found the arena terrain unsuitable for the event.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided not to have a bullfight.
The weather conditions severely disrupted the festivities, with two of the three events being cancelled.
The rain delayed the second bullfight on Saturday.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were supposed to fight the bulls of Castilblanco.
So they only had bullfights on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy, carried on his shoulders after a battle of exquisite and aesthetic.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante, thanks to his two bulls, won many awards and a trophy, but he owed it more to the public than to his own performance.
But El Juli followed, and he did little to increase the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the crowd was swept off their feet.
In the meantime, a two-ton truck carrying hashish tried to escape a traffic stop.
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Police are conducting a traffic control operation in the administrative area of Armiñón, Álava.
A van containing two people is stopped by the authorities, and the passengers try to escape the measure.
The shipment, over two tons of hashish, was non-obvious, though.
Investigators have pursued the passengers and one of them, a 28-year-old man, has been arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government's Interior Department said.
The man arrested is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred in the municipality of Armiñón, where the employees of the Álava Traffic Authority were conducting a traffic check on the N-1 highway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, gave it a sudden throttle, and then left the scene of the inspection.
The detectives chased him, and the vehicle stopped at a stop sign a few miles away, while the passengers fled the highway into a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police finally caught one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its consignment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish balls that filled the back of the vehicle were taken by the police to be examined more closely and to measure the drugs.
In addition, during the inspection it was proven that the fake license plate of the vehicle does not match the data in the documents of the van, therefore the arrested person is also being prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continue the investigation, aimed at, on the one hand, the arrest of the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled from the highway, and on the other, to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was taken to the police station for necessary questioning, and within a few hours, court proceedings were underway.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence.
Heather Locklear, the actress who played Amanda on Melrose Place, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw him maneuvering out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "put gas on the floor, turned the engine, tried to leave the parking lot, back and forth, and reversed the sun visor several times".
A short time later, a witness who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear pull up on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "in fear of Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"It seemed like a distraction", so the patrols took him to a drug and alcohol testing center that specializes in that.
A police spokesman said the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately, adding that officers' initial impression was that Locklear was under the influence of drugs.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unknown substance, and was taken to the local jail at about 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear was released from an Arizona sanatorium two months ago where he was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) federation to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the union will decide on the case of former youth and sports advisor to the Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to provide benefits to his family members.
"In these matters I am far more federalist, and this is certainly the responsibility of the Andalusian organization", Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply against the former member of the city council of Seville.
On the other hand, the IU president stressed that "transparency" should be taken into account when investigating possible irregularities committed by Silva: "The IU has always been committed to ensuring that such cases are as transparent as possible".
He added that the training included "a strict code of ethics for civil servants".
"Blood of May", by Garci, epic work
Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes was inspired by José Luis Garci's evocation of the Spanish's famous anti-French revolt in Blood of May, which, with a budget of almost 15 million euros, is the most important work in his filmography.
Accordingly, the director has tried to illustrate the human flow and social analysis in the work of the famous novelist, which he has always admired, as he told the audience of actors today, in the company of film director Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The two-and-a-half-hour-long "May Blood" will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and will later be shown as a four-hour mini-series on Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, has realized his childhood dream with this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Province of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events of May 2 in Madrid.
The 15 million budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, and it was a unique opportunity for Garci to show, in rich decoration and costumes, "the confused Spaniards who had mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, since the struggle for independence had plunged the country into a great recession under Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's ghosts, which more than doubled the blood of May. For this reason, he had to omit some scenes from the script, which - as on many other occasions - are remembered together with Horacio Valcárcel.
So he followed the usual method of the director of The New Beginning, shooting scenes with the actors with whom he had already begun rehearsals before filming, and casting was not done because Garcia considered it "humiliating" and because, as he said, "part of being a director is going to the theater and the movies to find out what's going on in the industry that you're working in".
Several actors of May Blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not step in front of his camera for the first time.
Garcia - who has four Oscar nominations and one Oscar - believes that the nominations for this year's Spanish entry to the Hollywood Academy, namely Blood in May, the Seven French Billiards and the final film, Blind Sunshine, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented", he said.
Garci's not counting on an award for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that the only thing that matters is getting by, and then you're happy to have another film made", says Garci, who has a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville is commemorating a flamenco dancer from Seville.
Born in Triana, Spain, to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), Carmen Tórtola Valencia moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
She was an expert in free dance and oriental dances.
During her active life, she was a pioneer in the fight for women's equality, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against the wearing of the girdle which inhibited the freedom of movement of women.
The war in Europe sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution, and Isabel Bayón was fascinated by her life.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, and he recommended me Tortola, whose personality really impressed me".
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell the story of your life but to capture your spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, the guajira is from the "butterfly dance", or the tango is from the "snake dance".
"It was a very emotional dance, and some people say it's my style", she says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, who has sung in Isabel's performance since Open Doors; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilda plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm so happy that you've accepted the offer, and I'm so honored that you're going to be in my play".
In addition, the production includes the music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussionist El Pájaro, the brazier Rafa El Viola, and the actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character that constantly invades the real div".
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London but travels across Europe and even to places considered distant at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great influence on his age, but nowadays his work is not known and even less appreciated", says Bayón.
The performance begins tonight at 8:30, at the Lope de Vega theater.
At the end of the Triennium, "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will be published.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet will take place at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The presentation is part of its series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of both of them.
The Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium will conclude with the re-publication of the work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial hall and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Oak", which will visit several Andalusian provinces and New York in time for the International Congress.
The Cultural Commission of the Regional Government of Andalusia has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet edited by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile poets of Andalusia.
America is not so attractive without Paul Newman.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that".
The quote comes from Sally Field, who worked with Newman on the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman's death has caused in the American film industry and in America as a whole.
It's hard to get an Oscar.
Retired in 2007.
And he was publicly sick.
But still, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to express our feelings in words, and I have lost a good friend", said tearfully Robert Redford, "who has made my life and this country better".
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or of being exaggerated.
A hero of the cinema and of the home, he lived through a particularly dark period, shadowed by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-respect and dignity.
When times are hard like this and people lose their virtues so easily and there are so few people left to look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
He embodied the Platonic notion of beauty and truth with the people's reality.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation he set up in memory of his first-born son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his home-style organic food brand.
It was a gift to a country that had a hard time getting over its suicidal food culture.
My overwhelming admiration has swept through all of Hollywood, regardless of nationality or background.
The last James Bond, according to Englishman Daniel Craig, died not as a man, but as an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning actor Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He set the bar very high for all of us", said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to emulate Paul Newman's lifestyle of honesty and privacy away from the serious and the cameras.
That's not always easy, if it's possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He was divorced once, but then he lived in a faithful marriage for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, though he certainly had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why eat hamburgers anywhere else when you can have fried meat at home?" he joked.
He's proud in heaven to have fans on earth, which is not very common in America.
"Of all his roles", they say, "he was more proud of none than his role as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted philanthropist".
The rugged path of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympic in Madrid, and after 2012 failed, it may be 2016 will be.
But I'm asking, are we really ready for this?
Because, judging from yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of the many I've been to.
It was a cluster of absurdities, and if it were to be evaluated and I was the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
But let's go through it in order and start at the beginning.
The absurdities began with the acceptance of the serial number, for that reason you had to arrive earlier.
That's not a problem in itself, but if you're going fast, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid being in the back row).
That's not what happened.
First they gave me only the serial number (first nonsense, just to go there early) and (after standing in the usual line), what a surprise, it was only a S-shirt (second nonsense, because I have exactly an XL size)!
What kind of world are we living in?
Or have they decided to cut back on material because of the crisis and buy only cheaper, smaller-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things still pale in comparison to what happened on the day of the race.
Besides the awful early hour to pick up the chip, the wait in line was 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started and we didn't give up the backpack, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, which was punctuated by attempts at rioting and stand-up attacks, even more pleasant.
I think we're gonna have about 500 confirmed cases of pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of them, myself included, won't be getting our location with our actual time, because I'm assuming my chip has mis-recorded the departure.
If you were to ask me about the perfect running race, of course, I wouldn't think of it by accident.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-equipped Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft unveiled the development of a new image-recognition and human-interaction system, a type of not-so-intelligent artificial intelligence that can perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle on company property) based on information it hears from conversations.
Using a camera and a face-recognition system, this "receptionist" can recognize how many people are in a room, who they are - even what they are wearing - and can listen to and understand key words in their conversations.
And then, based on the conversations, you can group the people in the room.
In the introduction video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that he is not part of the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she has come to visit someone and assures her that she will come to her aid soon.
All without the big blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
The company has more important things to do right now, like developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about Microsoft changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran only the necessary programs instead of all that commercial junk, then machines would be five times faster -- bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish vial, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version.
The change in course is reversible.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming more and more outdated, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I also joined the theory that Google took the first step to become a competitor to Windows.
Many people have correctly realized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, because it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but you have to reckon with the death of the operating system, not in the absolute sense, but in the relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports that idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on our computers just to open Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and we spend more time browsing than we do in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with it?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 is going to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overwhelming, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services more online and to eventually become an alternative to Google.
And they really need it, and I'll give you an example of why.
I took this picture earlier this month in a lounge set up for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
A poster on the vending machine tells them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not in early 2009, but at the end, in fact, in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the cell phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slowdown, given that Android and the iPhone are already on the market, will certainly hurt their business.
The Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, by Leonardo di Caprio on Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, by Al Pacino on Francis Ford Coppola's Crossing the River, and by a number of the derided gay shoppers.
And while we're at it, we might as well bring up the peaceful figure of the traveling circus goat mustache weightlifter.
But what are we talking about, nothing more than a typically slender, unkempt, male cotton-tray?
I mean, the "tank", as the English call it, but with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, no rival can compete.
First, because of his elegant name - though he is known to his friends as "Marcel" - which he owes to sports, since legend has it that he was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The Marcel stands out from its competitors for its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive emblem and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which is hidden in the collar of the shirt by the most traditional models.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports suits, retro boxers, cashmere sweatshirts, wool sweaters, navy sweatshirts, baby clothes, mini suits - and countless others - are all part of the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it's also unfortunate that they have to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is"
He's very much like his brother, but he's also managed to become himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
The Cruz sisters are currently looking to take a more serious role in the fashion world.
Monica thinks modeling is so much more than just some pretty, pretty girl giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new Paris headquarters and the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's got a warmth and a gentleness that's catchy.
What are you doing in Paris, anyway?
We're presenting the new Mango fall/winter collection, designed by me and my sister Penelope, and we're also presenting the second Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentino Gala dinner at the Opera.
It's a busy day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot from them.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch the women dress, and how they vary and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You're a dancer, an actress, a fashion designer, you're a woman of many facets, aren't you?
I think so, too, but these three things are connected, because they have so much in common.
I've been interested in clothes since I was little, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's house and look through my aunt's closet.
Well, that was Canaan, almost equaling an amusement park.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to be careful about what I wore.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals, so we can have a good time looking in the mirror.
And in the acting part, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, everything is connected, and I have a lot of respect for designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you go into lethargy?
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm feeling better than I've ever felt, and I love the '30s.
I think women are really getting there, they've had enough experience and they're making fewer mistakes in life.
I'm not worried about the biological clock.
Since childhood, I have done what I love, and it has brought me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
And as for the father-to-be, it doesn't matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and love.
Let's talk about the cinema, you made a lot of films last year that haven't been shown yet.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I want everything right away, but of course I know that it is impossible.
I can't wait to see the presentation of The Last Hour and the Search for Christ's Tomb.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she invited me to a charity fashion show in London that she was running for her organization, Women for a Better World, and I chose two of her Mango collections, and the clothes that were on display were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much that's been put together about him, and I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activities.
You asked me to do the fashion show for a noble cause, but if you wanted me to stand tall, I would.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I know no impossible.
Drunk drivers will be required to install the Alcolock
The Department of the Interior would require a driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting when the driver is drunk or not breathing into the device after three DUI violations.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office, which says the pilot project will last for one year.
As the aim of the project is to restore the vehicle to traffic, the driver will also have to attend a repeated course on traffic education.
The pilot will involve the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA), in addition to the Attorney-General's Office.
Statistics show that 30 to 75 percent of drivers who are repeatedly arrested for DUI are getting back into their cars.
The Alcolock would prevent this, because the system connected to the vehicle would detect the alcohol level of the air injected. If it is higher than the permitted level or if the driver does not inhale the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the device, which is over 1000 euros, would be borne by the offender.
A related 2007 study in the USA demonstrated that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on breaches of the rules for two reasons: firstly, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming criminal offences;
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of legal reform is carried out in the usual way, whereas the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment of the Basic Law.
The apparatus is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's initiative to install the system in school buses, following the French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
At exactly the time announced in the program, at 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force transport plane arrived at the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already going down, but it was still so bright that we could only see the royal couple coming off the plane with our hands as eyeglasses.
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries.
A few hours earlier, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Royal Couple were coming to town on an official visit.
- Great, so there's not gonna be an airport transfer for a while, so she's local or something.
- No, no, sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press knows all about the Asturian princely couple and the significance of their visit.
Many wait on the red carpet of the airport hangar, with the 27 Marines guarding the dignities of the people.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a navy blue dress, and then the Princess, with the wind blowing through her long hair, in a tight-fitting suit but not her usual shoes with their toes sparkling - perhaps warned that a storm is coming to Mexico City.
They stop for a moment and smile for the cameras, then enter the hall, where the official reception will take place.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - they are greeted by a reporter from a Mexican television station.
The most valuable fashion prize
Paris is without a doubt the most fitting place in the world to host a fashion award, and of the most sophisticated and brilliant of the fashion designers alive today, Valentino is without a doubt.
Mango recently announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote young talents in the fashion industry internationally.
The main fee is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designer clothes on display in the Mango shop at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost cried with emotion.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European store and it just opened in 1335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
In the midst of the solemn celebration and the thanks to Valentino for presiding over the jury, we find ourselves at a sumptuous dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
In the company of the most entertaining Chagals, the banquet table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who had recently lost her brother, was left with a heavy heart and sadness, wearing a piece of the Company and some breathtaking jewelry from ELAH, and with her son Luis, who was two meters tall, close by, she was escorting Valentino to the main table of the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests, but he and Baron Rotchil were so chivalrous that they were left without suits, since they were both given by a lady.
Monica Cruz came into the store in her own designer pants and T-shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress, and at the nightly opera visit she was so taken with the company of Gaya Toledo in the ballet hall that she went down to one of the bars and to a grand plie-like routine, reminiscing about the old days.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace tour, but before she did, she showed some photos of her son on her phone.
The next morning, we saw Oliver Martinez, who is six feet tall and has a motorbike, and John Travolta arriving at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, bringing his own sheets and towels, and saying in advance that he would not ask for any perfume in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's the life.
1001, the stress-reducing number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 and one ways to shut off the chaos and confusion of everyday life.
The other good news is that you can find it all in one book, which will arrive in bookstores on September 30th, bringing with it the peace of mind.
It's almost torturous to be on the clock at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how fast-paced life is being forced upon us day after day in today's world.
The office is stress, the computer is back pain.
Stress is the public disease of the 21st century.
But there is no one way to overcome daily fatigue and workplace stress.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find a solution that suits their preferences and their leisure time.
The stress-relieving work is titled 1001 Relaxation Methods and the calmness that flows from it is from the publisher Pearson Alhambra y DK and is coming to bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress cannot be eliminated from the world of work or from personal relationships, this handbook will surely shake your faith.
It also offers other ideas to help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it's time to lie back in your chair, relax, and focus on reading.
♪ Speaking in their sleep ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the people who wake up and tell me what happened to them that day, but the people who talk in their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It's quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you have heard him talking at night.
In terms of frequency, it may be completely rhapsodic (for example, only occurring once in a high fever illness) or more regular (once a day, weekly, or monthly), and the child usually has no memory of anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night awakenings, nocturnal bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is also not legal.
As mentioned, it may be accompanied by a high fever, or even stress or a state of heightened excitement.
In any case, it's been little studied.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It may be soft, quiet, or may be incoherent, murmured, but it may also be in the form of shouting, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the symptoms are very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist.
As mentioned, this is a benign condition, so there is no cure unless it is accompanied by some other manageable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things we can do. Here's a preventive measure:
Make sure that your child is calm before going to bed.
Choose games that are soothing and avoid watching frightening or more aggressive TV shows or series.
We teach kids who are prone to nervousness or who have difficulty relaxing some relaxation techniques to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more soundly.
If he does start talking in his sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Helpful Counsel
Don't wake the child.
It's superfluous because the child is unconscious, but it would be disturbed.
Despite the fact that he's talking, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Remember, if you experience severe anxiety on more than one occasion, it is advisable to consult a professional or to find out what triggers your child's severe anxiety.
If he speaks intelligently (which is rare), do not start asking questions to get information.
It's useless anyway, because you're not conscious enough to collect your thoughts in your sleep.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you don't see the associated dream images, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and the possible conclusions you draw.
Never tell your child that you can ask him questions at night.
Not even for fun.
It's a very distressing situation.
So the most important thing is that you don't worry, because it's just a harmless episode of a few minutes.
Finally, straight to the Illhaeusern
After a long flight, the Illhaeusern team has finally gained momentum and won again on home turf.
Although it was not a great match, the yellow and black players were in several situations, one of which they were able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had a hard time finding the right rhythm.
The first shot was attempted by the guest team captain Kauffmann, but the ball from the far field barely touched the top of the goal post. Illhaeusern was then outnumbered, and the shots followed: Fonderflick attempted a long shot, then Hirn shot the goal above the goal. Romain spiccel and Diebold also attempted to shake Dannemarie's defense with a long shot.
On the other side, the players were concentrated in a block in the center court, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale first got into position for Dannemarie. Soon after, the first goal was scored: Diebold's first shot was scored by Illhaeuserni Marais, who had a great position, and then got it into the goal (53rd minute).
Illhauser's goal scorer, however, did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight in the backfield.
The Dannemarie, however, were unable to exploit their advantage, causing little inconvenience to the home team, who had just moved a little further back to strengthen their defence, and only in the last seconds, when the ball was very close to the goal after a great rush, did they sustain some excitement.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralysed traffic at several ports in Brittany and Normandy, and the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the President in a 'constructive spirit' and expressed the hope that Sarkozy would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of gas oil, which has exceeded the record average price of €1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, spokesman for the President of the Republic, said that the President "will discuss with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic jams were set up in the counties of Morbihan and Calvados, causing congestion along a road of almost 10 km.
They've also disabled traffic at the marina in Quiberon, but the roads to Belle-Île are not blocked.
Roadblocks have been set up on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tires and boards in front of the oil depots in the ports of Brest, while protests were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further disruptions in other ports along the Atlantic coast and in the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishermen did not board, and Le Havre, where some 20 vessels obstructed the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region have lifted the blockade of the massive Total oil refinery in the Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday what to do next and whether to attend the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Commission did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "fishermen do not give up their demands" and "are not willing to travel to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the operation of a vessel would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell below 0.30 euros a litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83 from cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have paid their respects to the late actor and film legend, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 planes this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, can keep up with the plans and is planning to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is highly anticipating the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft with 30 to 120 seats.
In total, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company rescued by the US financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay $85 billion in arrears, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times reports.
The deal would take away from AIG a large part of its other businesses, including its international life insurance and American pension business, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The Times reports that AIG's board of directors met on Sunday night to discuss the possibility of a sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG intends to sell include the company's aircraft leasing company, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times added.
But the paper says that no final decision has been made on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly access liquid assets to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, and in doing so, it is taking the risk of having to divest up to 80% of its capital and losing a corresponding proportion of its shareholders.
The Paris Historique's study of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bailout plan, with the Dow Jones index falling 6.98% (nearly 800 points lower than ever before) and the Nasdaq falling 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to close at 10 365.45 points.
The largest drop in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq, which is based mainly on technology securities, closed down by 199.61 points to reach 1 983.73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points, according to official closing data.
Wall Street was already weak at the opening, and then when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bailout plan to restore market equilibrium, it went into a deep dive.
The House voted 228 to 205 to reject funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
The plan was voted down by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
"This has sent a bad signal to the market, as it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan", said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market has counted on this plan,' he added, expressing concern that if such a plan were to be adopted a few days later, it would be 'too late'.
"If the plan is doomed, . . . the Fed and other central banks will have to deal with the crisis and lending conditions will continue to tighten", warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
Further heightening the sense of urgency, Piegza adds that "every passing day more and more financial institutions are going bankrupt" in the United States.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
The sudden acceleration of the crisis in Europe, which necessitated emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicates that the market is "not just in crisis in the US, but in crisis worldwide", adds an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has picked up considerably.
The yield on the 10-year government bond fell from 3,827% to 3,632% by Friday night, while the 30-year bond fell from 4,357% to 4,161% the day before.
Obama won the first televised match
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge as the winner.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign officials claimed victory in the televised debate that was watched by one-third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that while John McCain's performance was admirable, it was not "too generous" to stop his declining popularity, as evidenced by the polls taken five weeks before the presidential election.
Gallup says the Democratic candidate is more likely to be challenged, with the poll released Saturday showing Obama ahead of McCain by five points (44% vs 49%).
Among the most influential undecided voters, 39 percent of those polled believe Obama will win, while 25 percent expect McCain to win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further boost his lead with his running mate, Joseph Biden, making a promising appearance on Thursday, as Biden prepares for his first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palint.
He has a good feeling".
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to highlight his own, undoubtedly vast, foreign policy experience, but also emphasizes his opponent's "naivete" on these issues that were the focus of their first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that"... the attack was repeatedly made.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president", McCain said.
It's the main attack surface, which has been used by the Republican TV commercials since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he was the future.
He was not embarrassed, he was focused and precise.
He emphasized that he could make good decisions and repair the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does", retorted a Democratic advert aired over the weekend, accusing the Republican leader of still not having gauged the impact of the crisis on America's "street people".
"In the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday to 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina for a rain-soaked election rally.
The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom Americans see as the man best suited to rescue a collapsing economy.
"The next seven weeks may prove to be a turning point", Senator Charles Schumer, the powerful Democrat, said yesterday.
Emanuel Rahm, a Democratic congressman and a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama has "the same economic instincts" as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final judgment on eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the volatility of the stock market, he would be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include the eventual energy independence of the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the creation of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, is planning to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates have been careful to avoid questions about the $700 billion bailout plan, which was passed by Congress last night and is deeply unpopular.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition demonstrators marched on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday night to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square after polling stations closed to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not been published yet, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: "Dictator, resign!"
Some admit that they did not even go to vote. 'Why would I go to vote? They can do whatever they want with my vote!' says one young person.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has been trying to make a good impression on foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic change of regime.
If the election is deemed fair by the observers, it could undo the sanctions that have hit the country, denying visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing some bank accounts.
The opposition, however, believes that the elections were not conducted in a fair manner.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes", lamented Yuriyem Potkin, spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, which is made up of twelve parties and is thus very heterogeneous.
"The changes were only nominal", stresses Aleksandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive power.
If the opposition delegates get into Parliament, it means they were appointed, not elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to be on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to introduce legislation.
The opposition must therefore take part in the political life, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be initiated'.
If our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk being taken over by Russia.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the election process, will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high and the widespread organization of the early voting (in which 26% of the electorate participated in Minsk) allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks social-democratic leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was the second to last to be released from prison this August, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one abstained in the polling stations.
And the parliament will be filled by no more than five opposition members, the ones who are most suited to the leadership.
The October Square is once again the quiet of the night.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are celebrating their success.
The Blood Is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood donation companies in the world.
Most important, he was able to regain the public trust that had been badly shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As is well known, the national blood bank maintained by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service was infected with HIV and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, the Canadian government launched a formal investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to formulate recommendations for preventing future similar cases.
While Justice Krever was late in submitting his report, some provinces formed their own committees to design a new blood-treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports led to the creation of two blood services in Canada: Héma-Québec, which serves Québec, and the Canadian Blood Services Corporation, which serves all other provinces and two territories.
"When Héma-Québec began its work in 1998, just 38 percent of people had confidence in the Québec blood-supply system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years that followed, however, the improvement in the safety of blood products and our work in the field have helped us to regain the trust of the people". Décary proudly reports that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
But Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is a very fragile thing".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, several cases of human infection with a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were detected in Europe, says Dr. Gerhardt, who has been running the association since it was founded in 1998.
"We had no idea that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So we took one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that if we are unsure and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we should take exclusionary measures, and in this case it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain damage, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was established beyond all doubt that the disease is also transmitted through the blood.
This case convinced us that the precautionary principle was a good idea".
In 1999 a technique was introduced that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV - a nucleic acid assay (NAT) that can detect the virus directly in the blood of donors, rather than the antibodies against the virus that previous tests were based on.
"With the NAT test, we have shortened the window period from infection to when we can detect the virus in the blood with our technology", he explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This greatly reduced the risk of unknowingly infecting the blood supply by donors and of its being undetectable.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS transmission through blood transfusions.
Today, the odds of someone getting blood contaminated with HIV are 12 million to one.
"In other words, that means we would have to distribute 12 million units of blood until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 units of blood annually, it would take more than 24 years for one such case to occur and for someone to become infected with HIV through a unit of blood.
"I think that today, anyone can accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health", says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen is getting into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus, which like the West Nile virus is transmitted through insect bites, appeared on the island of Réunion.
We must be on the alert at all times,' Dr Décary continued, and stressed that besides emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must have a sufficient permanent reserve.
"As the population ages, so do the needs.
As cancer-fighting treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population is also affecting the donor pool, since only 3% of Quebec's population is in the network of eligible donors.
However, any healthy person who is at least 18 years of age and who meets the eligibility requirements can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of the applicants refuse to accept blood because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria is rampant are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
"With that 3 percent, we have enough in reserve to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
But we need to increase the number of donors as the existing ones get older, because after a while, they can't give blood.
But it's very difficult to convince people to donate blood, and it's even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's fast-paced world, one has barely an hour to go and give blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeball tissue, and skin tissue, almost exclusively for use in the treatment of severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen, and then deposited at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Québec.
The cord, now treated as medical waste, can be used to extract blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the arrival of the thousandth cord blood sample in our bank a few weeks ago, and we plan to collect over a thousand new samples each year.
"We are going to start offering them for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who says that cord blood donation is very popular today.
'Many mothers are sad that they don't have the opportunity' - and this is true, because Héma-Québec cannot afford to make this complex and expensive program available in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - the Impact is in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounder 3-1 in the USL-1 qualifier yesterday to go 4-3 overall in the semifinals, the second game of the quarterfinals and the deciding game of the overall standings, held at Saputo Stadium.
The winner was Antonio Ribeiro, who scored the winning goal in the 90th minute.
While the first half went without a goal, in the second, two Montreal midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, hit the opposing team's net.
The only Sounders player who managed to play Matt Jordan was Roger Levesque.
Let's remember that in their first game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact are in the playoffs against the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder, who lost 3-1 to the Whitecaps in the first game, won 4-1, but the Whitecaps still made the playoffs with a 5-4 record.
The Impact are expected to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the matchup are still being worked out today.
In the nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite trio is ready for the new season.
A trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led off a great offensive line, and the Canadiens finally won against the Florida Panthers 3-2 on a penalty shootout last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meet, scored a goal, Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goal pass, which was the team's fourth win in six preliminary matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian player warns.
"I need one more game to feel really fit".
"He tried too hard to get you to come out in the first trimester", observed Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the result of the match.
He got a big ovation".
Charest's Northern Attempts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the elections will begin this year
As soon as the Liberal Party assembly was over, Jean Charest was already on his way to Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is seeking to win the midterm elections today.
'Reclaiming our last great northern border': this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis.
During his lecture, behind the back of the stage, a series of images similar to "Moulin à images" were projected.
The three giant projectors were filled with stunning images: dams for hydroelectric plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
These spectacular devices are usually deployed during election periods.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee that the elections would not take place this autumn, although he added that the timetable was very tight.
The fourth pillar of the "Northern Plan" is the "vision" of the Prime Minister for the future of Québec, which is embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements with Ontario.
The opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at the 49th parallel) has been a frequent topic in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The Head of State, however, only explained why he considered the North to be "a treasure trove of enormous possibilities", without mentioning the time factor, the amount of investment, or the specific priority of future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: water power, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is being further boosted by the growth of countries in recession and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
In the north, "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", wrote Chares.
This area, "two times the size of France", "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us", the President reiterated, stressing that he wanted to create a national founding myth.
He stressed that the development of Quebec was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a stage break to gaze at the giant map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed for itself, the head of government said at a press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been endorsed by all governments.
There is a line that has been a long time without agreement and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government", he said.
On the other hand, "we must rethink our approach to the North in the light of climate change", he said, referring to the north-western passage that opens up every year as the polar ice melts.
The Prime Minister believes that in this new geopolitical environment, the capture of the territory is an important task.
What about the indigenous people of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would give them priority and that the plan would bring many benefits, especially to the young.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate from the Parti Québécois in Ungava) have already started negotiations with some thirty local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee, led by Benoît Pelletier, also began to function, with Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) playing an important role.
The Prime Minister doesn't rule out a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where they "create a shared vision".
The development of the region would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematic and environmentally friendly", the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as being in line with the ideas of the previous Liberal Prime Minister.
"Just like the previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend which began with a big cocktail party on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as a party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power station be converted into the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"Our party politicians, including Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who brought about the silent revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydroelectric plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another, albeit conservative, work, namely the 1957-1963 programme of John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, entitled "Roads to the North".
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam project, President Charest stressed that the dam was scheduled to be operational by 2012.
"Keep it between us, but I plan to be there", he told his followers, who applauded him loudly.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, with tasks to be undertaken at the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party rally held at the end of the week provided the Liberal president with an excellent platform to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without thinking, and in particular the "constitutional aspirations": the Liberal party in particular demands recognition of the "special character of Québec" in the Constitution.
I would also like Québec to appoint the members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, and these members would have a veto over decisions made in Québec.
The opposition, however, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-introduced the northern Québec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't, she said, "we would be a long way ahead by now", agreeing with Françoise Mercure, who was nominated for the Jean-Talon vote scheduled for today.
The ADQ is an opposition party that supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"We want it to be more than a show", said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his holiday today.
Letters - A Favoured Country
Vic Toews, the Harper cabinet minister (also the "justice" minister) last summer had the audacity to call Louise Arbourt "the shame of Canada".
To insult a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and deserves all our admiration - that says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, the only Western country that has not repatriated its citizens from Guantanamo.
It's a government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager when he committed the crimes that he's accused of.
This is the only government that, despite Canada being a signatory to the Geneva Convention, has reneged on its word and allowed a child soldier to languish in inhuman conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet show of the justice system while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let's just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also calling for Omar Khadr's extradition to Canada to be given a fair trial.
And our government is blind to torture, not caring that a young adult is now spiritually destroyed, and that many years of torture have likely sealed his fate for life.
We may not be aware of it, but there is a subtle destruction of our rights, our freedom, our democracy. "Democracy" is a word Harper repeats incessantly, and it sounds like an empty word coming out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morality: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the whim of the leader of a government that has been in the minority until now (and what will happen after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that salvation lies in a party that glorifies the Prince, Law and Order, and they fail to see that this government is trampling on the very values that have given this country its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is this - look no further.
Opinion - The Orwellian oration of Barrick Gold
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine, was published in the September 17 issue of Le Devoir.
Following Orwell's rant, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a $6 million libel suit against three authors and a small-cap publishing company for the purpose of initiating a so-called "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, they base their decisions - especially in defamation cases - not on truth but on the law.
It's no wonder Garver was silent about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to engage in public debate to destroy anyone who disagrees with their position?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to defend and fight an unequal fight with an army of lawyers on the other side, supported by the mining industry's almost inexhaustible resources.
In such an unequal fight, however, the tactic of undermining the plaintiff and making friendly settlements is often employed, not only to silence opponents but even to intimidate those who would try to re-open the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have spoken to the public.
Although this is not the case in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the parties to a dispute usually do not strike each other with a club but speak their minds.
So all the mine had to do was open up its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying independent research groups to shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public and is throwing out petitions and letters written in defense of Noir Canada's authors with a motion.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain to me how he could initiate a "public" debate while ignoring the views of that public?
In the vice president's mind, the word probably means only the lavishly paid lawyers and not the entire population of Canada, and the meaning of the term is much reduced.
In a democratic state, even those who speak ill of others have the right to free speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the main reason why the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are supported by the public is because they condemn the mine's brutal methods.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and make a judgment, but on the basis of civilized reasoning, rather than through a lawsuit that many would prefer to silence (and, incidentally, in connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently wrote to Noir Canada's authors to ask them to refrain from using that term.)
Beyond Garver's surreal arguments, the Barrick Gold case is an open attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and the pursuit of truth that are the building blocks of any democratic society.
In the process as a whole, it denies the right to cite credible sources, to debate facts and their interpretation, which are the basis of intellectual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss topics that are frowned upon by the corporate world of today, who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada use.
You have the right to answer.
We have long been able to handle debates, disagreements and conflicts in our academic circles.
Barrick Gold's reckless conduct clearly shows that, contrary to his assertions, he is not inclined to engage in open debate.
This is a loss for both the academic world and the Canadian public debate institution, and it is time for governments to implement measures that limit the legal process for such abuse.
The Wall Street rescue - Democrats and Republicans have agreed
The Bush administration and the congressional Republican and Democratic leaders finally agreed yesterday to an economic rescue package, the largest of its kind since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to end the financial crisis that has been roiling Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective control of implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public funds allocated; new provisions to maintain the number of houses occupied due to the delay in payments; access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Republican Congressman Judd Gregg, who was in the meeting, announced the good news just before midnight yesterday, after the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets", declared Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush administration.
"We did all this to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be a tremendous amount of shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans", said Republican Representative Judd Gregg.
The trial has been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another setback could have a negative impact on investor sentiment.
They gave you until the opening of the stock exchange this morning to make a deal.
The two candidates who joined the negotiations late expressed their willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed their displeasure that the situation had escalated to the extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with expanding the agreement with elements such as provisions for the preservation of home ownership and the payment of executives of state-assisted companies.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take some extraordinary action because of other people's irresponsibility, it's not very welcome.
But these steps are necessary", he noted on a U.S. television program.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so".
"What I have read in the main lines shows that this is something that we all need to digest and move on with.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan would use taxpayers' money to buy up the dubious claims of American financial institutions, their risky, unmarketable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt-embracing (commercial) securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was unveiled by a group of Republican lawmakers last week.
We seem to have gotten out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to let the government insure certain "toxic" assets of distressed companies rather than buy them.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan included a provision that if the government is to suffer losses under the program for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, an initial payment of $250 billion would be made, followed by another $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for the aid, Washington will receive shares in the subsidized companies, which will be divided into profits and then sold after the crisis has subsidized.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the foreclosure of the real estate underlying the mortgages covered by the plan and to set the maximum amount of wages and final compensation to be paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's developers want to see the House vote on it today and the Senate vote on it Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, there is still no certainty that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there was a renewed outcry against the plan from both the Republican and Democratic parties.
"It's clear that Washington does not hear your voice", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we are having serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is none that is favorable to the taxpayers".
Brad Sherman, the Democratic congressman who leads the small congressional group called the "skeptic faction", presents it differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred of the world's leading economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to ask Congress to take the time to consider carefully what course it is taking", Sherman said yesterday.
And in Europe, at that very moment, it was understood again that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis dispute, the three Benelux states announced that they would be nationalising part of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was made necessary after BNP Paribas of France announced that it would not buy its near-bankrupt competitor, after it had lost EUR 2 million (USD 2.9 billion) in the secondary mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis, with 85,000 employees, is the 20th largest bank in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
"This is not money thrown away", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is precisely something that depositors and households are appreciating now that the situation is uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government appears to be preparing to nationalise another bank, which has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the outstanding loans of the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which the real estate loans account for 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion U.S. dollars).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they will be buying the British bank's subsidiaries and client assets.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has tried to privatize since the crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - A farewell to the acting idol
His beautiful blue eyes were considered by some to be his greatest asset, by others his greatest weakness.
Has the American actor with the charming smile ever gotten rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes, and no.
His shyness, sensitivity and innate talent also kept him away from the harsh style that is the very existence of the great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge track he ran into!
Paul Newman, 83, died of lung cancer on Friday at his Connecticut estate, one of the last icons of the golden age of American cinema.
He was less of a monumental personality than Brando, whom he resembled and who had long been his rival on the screen, and in his roles he was more reserved and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also preached freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results in abnormal children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian descent.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the most symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
He was the embodiment of the self-made man and the pacific war-torn nation of the warrior ideal. In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at the Actor's Studio in New York before bursting onto the world of theater, television and, much later, film.
As well as being a civil rights activist, he was a race car driver, runner-up in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a sex symbol, despite having been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now, we will never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, reclusive, dedicated actor who hated the glitz of show business.
He was a man of integrity, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week shocked movie-goers, as we now see him in his big role on the black screen of memories.
Looking back on his life's work, we have the seventh American art, cinema, in continuous change for over fifty years.
We remember the charming cowboy in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man who was estranged from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the 1958 Tennessee Williams production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof".
He is most recently remembered for his role as the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, faces the fact that his marriage has not lived up to his expectations.
Paul Newman has a lot of other faces in his films.
Robert Wise's memorable portrayal of the violent crime-fighter Rocky Graziano in "Boy Up There" launched Newman's acting career in 1956, a role originally intended for James Dean, and which he took over after his death.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film "The Big Bang", which won the Oscar for best picture in 1973.
He played a resentful, vindictive billiard player in Robert Rossen's genius film The Swindler (1961) and returned to a similar role in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, for which he received his only Oscar nomination in 1987 out of nine nominations.
Times change, but the face is always the same: it was him.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by a change of era.
Younger audiences may know him from George Roy Hill's cult film Icebreakers (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of a hockey team who uses unconventional methods.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Leap" in 1994.
The series ended with Sam Mendes's "The Road to Perdition" in 2003, his last appearance as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its glitter, glamour and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier considered it "a living denial of the understatement" with a certain humour: he thought his play was too strong.
But the industry was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who had been getting film roles for a long time.
However, he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he played characters living on the edge of society - nervous, alcoholic, ill-tempered or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he could return with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a less-known face: a man who was deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deep, deep, deeply, deeply, deeply, deep, deep, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deep, deeply, deep, deep, deep, deeply, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,
In the 1968 film Rachel, Rachel, with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, he painted a delicate portrait of a melancholic woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and Son", which is a film of restraint and sadness, is a tribute to his son, Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman was remembered by countless admirers, including his close friend and former partner, Robert Redford, who, in a heartbroken statement, said, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have lost.
His legendary career is overshadowed by his civil rights, environmental, and independent film work, and his comments on Hollywood's excesses.
We've seen her smile on the packaging of sausages, sauces, cookies and other foods, and she's got a bad mouth, although she thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always donated to a foundation for children with the disease.
Newman never sat on his hands: he remained committed to the profession throughout.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and forever unimaginably grateful for the lucky star.
It has been a privilege to be here".
We are privileged to have followed the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a good citizen, above all.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Tsai factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, in a criminal organisation and in a businesslike manner, causing particularly significant damage.
According to the prosecution, the funds received from the tender were used for their own purposes, and the completion of the tasks was often confirmed by fake invoices.
The state and municipal funds - totalling some HUF 65 million - went partly to the cash register of the Young Left and partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the tender money was collected on the basis of cost statements that were not backed by real performance and the associations never fulfilled the obligation undertaken.
The indictment says most of the bills were fake.
The bills were obtained from the market in Josephsburg, and the postage stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And which companies the invoices were issued to, among other things, on the route to the Balaton area, where Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed to looking for inns and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption there, which was then used to prepare invoices to be submitted to the applications of, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Labour Fund, and the Metropolitan Municipality.
Most of these were written by István Lados with his colleague, András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote mostly the reports necessary to obtain the grants.
One of the highlights of Lados' "study trip" was a bar.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlag family in 2003, the restaurant catered for a group of 90 persons belonging to the Sigur Point Association.
However, according to the manager, that number would not have entered the restaurant at one time.
Similarly, the invoice for the Better Future - later called Together for the Third Millennium - Foundation issued in the summer of 2002 was riddled with errors of form and content.
A boarding house in Badacsony had only three rooms, and no more than ten people could sleep in it for one night, but the number was one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form-fillers went too far when they marked Pigal Kft., another hospitality company, whose accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not contain the documents for the Better Future and the Hoppá name.
His manager, Wolkas Győző, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were wrong on the stamp".
He added that, apart from the formal reasons, it was not true that the bill said that 100 people were accommodated, since they have 11 rooms in total, which do not have enough space.
Plus, the bill was for the food, and the restaurant hasn't been open for a while.
The enthusiastic account creators did not investigate the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they looked at, only organised foreign trips, so they marked travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not in line with the company's invoice issuing practice.
Moreover, as the investigation revealed, the document included VAT, whereas the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the VAT rate was incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to Jobb Jövőért, because the company's service was not charged with the indicated 25 percent VAT, but with 15 percent VAT, and the hotel employees only issued a machine-made invoice, while the manufactured invoice was hand-made.
Furthermore, the 'exhibitors' compounded the situation by marking the road haulage of goods as an activity carried out for one company, as was established by the prosecution, which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
Also, because of the irregularities - the wrong invoice format, the wrong stamp - it turned out that the invoices for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Safe Point were fake.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sportkamp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Ariegyháza was being liquidated at the time (2001), when the group of the Association for the Young City was dining there, which is why the liquidator of the company - as far as we know - denied that he had drawn up the paper.
They deliberately set off
The second group of invoicers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Foundation for Budapest has issued an invoice for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Co., according to the indictment, was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue a fictitious invoice.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlages in the now-under-liquidation Biogate Kft., which in 2003 provided the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Vörösfenyő Association with invoices worth roughly HUF 5 million, which were not backed by any real economic activity.
No cash flow, because the accounts were later cancelled, but the organizations forgot to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoices are those which can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery agent for the Ukrainian manager of the fuel and automotive retailer Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest but not located there, was Ivan Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhala, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was managed by a Romanian man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would have also forwarded documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know that during the investigation Kubatov admitted that he issued an invoice in the name of the company to Atlas, Hopp and the Foundation Together for the Third Millennium, and that he paid for it.
The Romanian authorities have provided the Commission with information on the economic situation of the Romanian quarrying companies in Romania and on the economic situation of the quarrying companies in Romania.
But in reality, none of the companies were operating, which the defendant said was because they hadn't been offered jobs.
The companies benefited, however, because at the request of his partner, the lawyer Szente Zsolt, who also prepared the company documents, he issued invoices in the name of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has issued a total of 15 invoices to the entities, amounting to HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution believed that the invoices were 10 percent of the amount and the VAT was the Kubatov mark.
He even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious bills, which were produced for the Sigur Pont tender.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a bid to the socialist party's public-benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They won 500 000 forints, but they didn't spend it on the projects they had announced.
To avoid that, five fictitious invoices from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found during a search of Kemecsei Árpád's office at the education wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as the prosecution did, will probably report on the billing process.
The most interesting thing is when the accused himself, John Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to speak extensively, he has not done so.
The question is whether he is willing to do it, because the socialists have made a deal with him for the return of the bulk of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
He may have been offended by the fact that his requests for relief from his detention, namely house arrest, were consistently ignored.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater damage and do not repair it can walk free or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he has no such opportunity.
The psychology of over-bidding: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuroeconomic basis for this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior has been uncovered by neuroscientists and economists at New York University.
Their study, published in the journal Science, says that people are willing to pay a premium for a competitive product, such as an eBay auction, if they don't want to be outdone.
The research attempted to map the neural circuitry of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in a lottery, while the other participated in a toy auction, while the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method examined the active brain areas of the subjects.
Both games offered money, but in the auction game, where the over-bidding of the other party is a major element, the striatum, a complex under the brain's cortex, became actively involved when the game was lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system, among other functions.
Therefore, the researchers believe that the increase in price can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists in the research group also conducted a financial impact study.
In this case, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they did their thing.
Another group was also promised a $15 bonus if they won the game.
The third group, on the other hand, had just received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost that money in a losing auction.
So the only difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized on winning, and the other group was emphasized on losing.
However, proving the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the "lose-lose" teams were willing to bet even higher than the control and "win-win" groups.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
For until now, they have explained the phenomena of auctioning solely by the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging techniques have helped to resolve the conflict between these two theories, and now we have a third explanation", stated Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should I see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death in Hungary.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis here, but only 7,000 are being treated, and the reason is that patients often don't know they're infected.
The term hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
They have many similarities in symptoms, typically hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E are transmitted through the digestive tract (e. g., through contaminated food, water), and hepatitis B, C, D, and the other viruses are transmitted through blood and body fluids (feces, vaginal excrement, saliva).
Travellers should be vaccinated against A and B viruses, but there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, generally accompanied by nausea, weakness, stomach complaints, nausea.
After this, the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow, the stool is light, the urine turns dark, and the healing process may take two or three weeks.
One million people a year die worldwide from the more severe form of the disease, hepatitis B, caused by liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected with the virus receive treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis, even liver cancer.
Most people who are infected are unaware of their disease, for the virus subtly destroys the cells of the liver, often taking 20 to 30 years for the first symptoms to appear.
So it's very important to do early prevention, to do regular screening.
Three groups have a much higher rate of this disease than the average: transfused people before 1991, people who use drugs, and people who have tattoos.
Worldwide, there are an estimated 200 million people who are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to consult your doctor if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Early detection of the disease can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus eliminating infectiousness and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
It aims to raise awareness of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its causes and the importance of early detection.
Does believing in God make you feel less pain?
Recent research has found that religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to examine how belief in God affects people's perception of pain, reports the Telegraph of England.
In a rather bizarre experiment, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were electrocuted while all of them were studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that the Catholic faithful were able to exclude much of the pain.
The human brain scan technique also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics, as well as scientists, philosophers, and theologians from across the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkler device to the subject's left hand, which was the source of the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look intently at two paintings, a 17th-century painting by Sassoferrato, and a 15th-century painting by Leonardo da Vinci, Lady Hermeline.
The study's authors hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would evoke a religious mood among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the others and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sessions, while looking at either the religious-themed or the general image.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" and "protected" and "calm and at peace" during visions of the Virgin Mary.
The religious-themed viewers reported 12 percent less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was involved in the study, believes that the same effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even for atheists, just by finding the right photo.
"We should find an image that makes people feel very positive about them, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"The practice of faith should and often does change our personality", added Wright.
After these wonderful results, the question is, if you showed the faithful a painting of the Madonna by Leonardo or a similar artist, what effect would that have on their pain management?
Would a vision of the Virgin Mary have better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On its 10th birthday, Google can tell you that it's in people's pockets as much as it is in the sky above them; it knows where they've been on vacation, what they've been to, and what they're interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top people.
And for the skeptics who are drawing parallels with Orwell's nightmare, they're the ones who are missing the point of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's primary goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, and that this is necessary to keep them in line with the original goal of the Google founders, which was to "put all the world's information in a system".
The Google boss said that after ten years of world-changing work, the company is just getting started on all the information it can handle.
Asked what it would be like in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions like "what am I going to do tomorrow?" or "what kind of job is right for me?" - but until then, software can't answer these seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that Internet searches record the exact words used, the IP address from which they were searched and the page to which the interested party went after the search.
Personalized Search, which was launched two years ago, allows users to store their browsing history, look back on what they've searched for, what they've clicked on, and in the long run, generate much more personalized results for them - the same logic that Recommendations will use to recommend products and services to us based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me, what if they see what I do? - users ask, worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, it's the potential power of the corporation that's scary, not the guilt, not the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, maybe the rebellion against power that's driving the online reaction.
However, it is a well-established fact that all search terms are not only recorded but may also be passed on to third parties where appropriate, and in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the most prominent recent example of this was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identifiable information about pedophiles from its Orkut social network.
Privacy-conscious netizens were able to mount a legal challenge in May when the company, in partnership with the EFF, successfully argued in court against the FBI that Google could not be forced by any provision of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(However, the federal government successfully fought off some fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms it had obtained by invoking the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but it still failed to obtain search lists of individual users or a complete web site and keyword list spanning two months.)
So Google's judgment is quite controversial: it is scolded by those who are afraid to give their personal information because they feel that their privacy is being violated by using Google's services and by rebelling against them with the image of a corporation that is glowing in conservative images.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its drive to bring together computer enthusiasts, activists, users in many countries, is seeing the next generation of big companies, the "leading corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which has emerged as a world leader because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
It's because Google, unlike Microsoft, doesn't ask for user IDs, doesn't charge for its applications, and the open source, free, continuously updated software package is more accessible, more youthful, and cooler than the official software giant's practices.
But it can also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been followed by one of the most frequently used keywords of recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces and taking advantage of the communication channels that are available to us, and while the scale of these varies from individual to individual, the essence is the same: show yourself.
The average young person can also have a profile on multiple social networks, from Facebook to Twitter, linking them to other services like Twitter or last.fm, which lists their music habits, linking them to social media like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and blogging, where they automatically see their latest photo galleries from Flickr or Picasa.
While there are many examples of this, the friend can easily figure out who her cheating boyfriend spent the night with by looking at the photo gallery of their shared morning circle of friends, or can fire a company employee just because he writes an honest opinion on his blog about top management: one sure is that the notion of privacy has been completely overvalued.
Living an online life is about what you show, and that's the foundation of what's going on with today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least want to avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with, for example, the Scroogle who uses the Google search engine but at the same time intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, many people who intentionally don't log on to social media so they can't be found, Google's online applications, from text editors to image editors to newsreaders, can be replaced by alternative versions that aren't tied to giant server farms and that don't build the best profile of us that's ever existed.
The public isn't exactly waiting in secret for Google to show off its tooth whites.
With a current value of $156 billion, it is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the accelerating pace of services introduction is causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, find the counter-arguments to be troubling: for example, the top management completely rejected the employees' protest after doubling the company's kindergarten fee, the company management found it too expensive to feed the employees multiple times a day, but all this is overshadowed by the fact that Google had to bow to the Chinese government in 2006 and under their agreement the company filtered all findings that hurt the good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they don't announce new services until they're ready to use them, but what they're sure to do is to take the problems that are coming up in the next few months and years and move the world to a new place: while some people think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project has reached a point where the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of the Health system, because it allows us to build a complete health profile of ourselves with our past records, our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, which could be a good source material for the next generation of science fiction writers, is that Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled Point, describes in Orwellian tones a future in which a human being can only be approached from Google data in a frighteningly good way.
Two juveniles assisted the Ozdi double murderer in the arrest.
Two teenagers were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder of a gangster, on the grounds that they helped to cover up the crime, said the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
The youths have admitted to the crime, and are currently being charged with conspiracy.
The two juveniles - two girls, according to the MTI - are in free fall.
Criminal defamation is punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the Oz double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of the premeditated murder of several people for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect refused to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a building in Oz on Wednesday, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and its use are being investigated by the police with the help of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - to buy the 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously excluded the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
The Polish state holds 99 percent of the shares, and it intends to sell more than 60 percent of the shares in a few months.
The Czech business daily E15 has just learned that the Polish bid represents the highest amount ever offered by the interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the dissolution of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion crowns by market experts.
Under the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of around 25%, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis as seen by European newspapers
In their Tuesday editorials on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already referring to "September 11 as the second".
The global financial disaster is due to the American president, accuses the Roman newspaper La Repubblica, the president was not even able to organize his own party behind the bill that was wounded in the wounds, which aims to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett has suggested, it's more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Some in the Madrid press are also seeing Washington as the culprit.
El Mundo sees the lack of political leadership there as bringing the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but the threat from the congressional vote is that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - at the very moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still bail out the failing financial institutions and use taxpayers' money to bail them out of bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor the new impulses will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to go beyond their national self-interest and centrise control over fragmented financial markets.
More than 100 billion euros were given to failing financial institutions on Monday alone, Vienna's Der Standard newspaper said, adding that there are growing concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, will have to dig deep to find a solution to the crisis.
The EU has not yet taken seriously the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviours" do not have to put up a hundred billion euros, but it would be good if they could fix when it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the dongo
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than by imitating natural obstacle detectors?
Like the bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumble bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting idea for how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimicrobot control system, a robotic mini-car endowed with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that eliminates all collisions.
"In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shell", explained Kazuhiro Doi, a technology PR and R&D brand manager at the exhibition.
The bee's complex eye, which can see more than 300 degrees in all directions, plays a vital role.
To replicate the function of the complex eye, engineers have turned to the idea of a laser telescope.
This identifies obstacles within 2 metres of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts into a collision avoidance action.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected and the robot, mimicking the movement of the womb, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels as needed to avoid the collision.
Unlike any current system, this evasive maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It must react spontaneously and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety guard, a layer within which a collision is currently considered to be unavoidable.
The whole process should mirror what one bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike the spokes, the deviation can't be up, down or transverse, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
So instead of the endless possibilities for bees to avoid other bees, here we just use the rotary motion and acceleration and deceleration as options for the Autobot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh believes that instinctive intelligence is the ability to process, much less store, information.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
It doesn't need to store them, and it reacts with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory all the time.
You don't need gigabytes of memory, or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing the immediate escape technology that Nissan estimates could be in production within ten years.
Another possible application is to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the car to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles in the road.

The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout bill, which is a multi-part program to buy bad loans from banks, is now in effect.
The first round will be half the amount.
In a new round of talks that lasted until after midnight Saturday, Eastern Standard Time, congressional leaders reached a consensus on the $700 billion bailout package that has been dragging on for days, Reuters reported.
The European Union has also been a major player in the fight against terrorism, and has been a major supporter of the EU's efforts to combat terrorism.
The compromise that was made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the compromise was a success, and that the program would work and be effective, but that more needed to be done, and Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy.
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened at 8pm Washington time on Sunday (i.e. 2am Monday morning Central European time), but it did not cause a spectacular uptick in the stock market.
The bill that would make the program effective, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, will be voted on first by the House of Representatives and then the Senate on Monday.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi Saturday night, and the White House welcomed news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the White House press secretary.
The program, by the way, is a departure from the original Bush administration proposal that the $700 billion would be spent on a single purchase of substandard, subprime debt securities.
Now, the first round of up to half of the $700 billion can be spent, with $250 billion immediately spent after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, with the Treasury buying credit-backed, subprime securities, and the remaining $100 billion depending on the president's decision.
The program will be overseen by a separate board, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is contingent on another Congressional decision.
Under the law, the Treasury can employ a combination of tactics: simultaneous purchase of bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly, according to the ministry.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial purse guarantees the assets causing the concern, for which the companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said the law would provide the means to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it's buying bad assets on a large scale, insuring them, or avoiding systemic risk by collapsing a major financial institution.
We'll take the necessary steps to be ready to enact the law as soon as it's signed.
But the heads of the banks in trouble and waiting for government relief can count on the government to limit their escape money - what the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute.
The limitation of salaries is only in certain cases and depends on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that when the department buys gold in an auction, it will be taxed as a surplus on the gold parachute, unless it is retired for the tax-free bankers.
In the direct purchase of bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the management's money is not overdrawn.
Adding to the picture is that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction will only apply to new ones, to encourage participation in the program.
"This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the compensation of CEOs", said the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires equity in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk for the taxpayers, who can eventually benefit from the transaction as the economy and the rescued bank recover.
The bill states that for the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress that provides for how to recover for taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, those on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, which is protect the taxpayer's dollars", said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were pushed by the same people responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12,9% compared to August 2007, KSH reports.
Prices of industrial export sales were 1,1% higher than in July 2008 and 3,9% lower than a year earlier.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0,7% higher than in the previous month and 3,2% higher than a year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally by 0,1% compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0,1% compared to July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in the leather footwear sector (2,8%) mainly due to the monthly price increases of 4,6% for handbags and belts and 2,5% for footwear.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical feedstock resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1,6%)
Prices decreased in the petroleum processing (1.4%), electrical machinery and equipment (0.9%) and, to a limited extent, wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we have measured an increase in prices between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which accounts for a significant proportion of the industry's domestic sales, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the spillover effect of the official increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, the petroleum processing industry showed the highest price increase (32,4%) in terms of domestic sales of the manufacturing industries.
The metal products industry recorded a price increase of 13.2% and the food, beverage and tobacco industry, which accounted for the majority of the increase, an increase of 11%.
The decrease in prices was recorded in the textiles and textile goods sector (2.5 per cent) and in the electrical machinery and equipment sector (0.3 per cent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the price increase rate ranged from 0,6% to 9,1%.
In the manufacturing sector as a whole, prices have risen by 10.2 percent in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than a year earlier.
In domestic sales, the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) was recorded in August in the sectors producing capital goods.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3%, while in the energy and consumption sectors prices remained unchanged compared with the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and downstream sectors (16,8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 6.8%, while in capital goods prices fell by 1.4%.
The export sales prices in industrial forint rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month and fell by 3.9% in the 12-month comparison.
Our national currency has weakened by 1.7% against the euro and 7.1% against the dollar in one month, and compared to August 2007 it has strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
You don't need a visa to come to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into effect around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the local Hungarian community leaders.
He said that "it is now almost all about whether the electronic entry and control system is built in time overseas".
He also pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before departing.
The Hungarian foreign minister is in Washington for talks today.
He meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Order of the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and holds talks with the foreign policy advisors of Barack Obama's Democratic Party and John McCain's Republican presidential candidate.
The bailout package is backed by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major U.S. presidential candidates, both pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there is a politician who is demanding the Treasury Secretary's resignation.
After days of marathon negotiations between congressmen and the administration, they announced early Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on a bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to thaw the frozen credit markets became a central issue in the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain both seem to be more suited than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls suggest that Obama's return to economic issues has given him a slight advantage, eclipsing the advantage that McCain gained by the Republican convention's nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama, at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, expressed his hope that the $700 billion package would pass through Congress quickly.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passages that he supported.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are at risk", he told the crowd of 35 000.
He didn't fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain told ABC, "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing this (...) but doing nothing is simply not the way to go".
The Republican senator said the bill would establish a committee to oversee the Treasury Department and limit the compensation of top executives, and he insisted on those.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House is expected to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The German language area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp have the voters become more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haider are ready to take over Austria to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
The Spiegel (Spiegel.de) is the newspaper of the day.
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, the Bavarian revolution devours its fathers, he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the noted political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renovating Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not a surprise to the CSU, but Sunday marked the end of a process that was almost exactly as likely as it had been ten years ago: the end of the undisputed hegemony of one political party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU dropped to 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s that it had fallen below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason is the CSU's consistent modernization of the province, devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong about the pace, and yet it could not have been without consequences for the voters' loyalty to the CSU in secularization, educational outcomes, and the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the voters have become more self-conscious, more critical, more opinionated.
It is also striking that in recent weeks it is the classic groups of citizens who have moved away from the CSU the most; the self-employed, the industrialists, the graduates and the highly educated.
The CSU's approval rating here has dropped below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in an article entitled "Who, with whom? The party leaders are restrained in coalition issues", discusses the confused domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not want to negotiate the coalition yet.
The election is over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely even let us look at their cards.
The Chairman of the SPÖ, Werner Faymann, confirmed that he wished to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible for the two parties to work together - in some provinces and in the social partnership, this is possible.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, as well as with the ÖVP chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
There's no way to repeat this trend.
Mol reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will not be successful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition, it's completely open in the party for now, and the issues absolutely have to be discussed within the party.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has once again shown himself to be open to all directions.
"We are ready to assume government responsibility to prevent a red-black coalition", said Haider.
Passenger: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Equal Opportunities Summit began in Paris, hosted by France, which holds the Presidency of the European Union this year.
In her message to the plenary, Járóka Lívia, a member of the European People's Party, and one of the main speakers at the professional conference, drew attention to educational segregation as one of the most serious violations of rights affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The conference was attended by representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma were excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youth do not have a secondary education and only a minority can obtain higher education because of the poor quality of their primary education".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role in the promotion of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can be a boost to the economies of the EU Member States.
The MEP believes that these links should be made known to the widest possible audience, including Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income and consumption taxes.
"The Roma should be guaranteed their right to quality education as citizens of the European Union and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education should be guaranteed", Járóka Lívia stressed.
The MEPs also stressed that the EU should be able to take action to ensure that the right to vote is respected, and that the right to vote should be respected in all Member States.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunities that the democratic space has given them, so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka demanded.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since the last Berlin meeting in the framework of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All', aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a while.
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided.
Despite the dismal election result, heads are not yet down, and the top of the Bavarian CSU has postponed the discussion of personnel issues for the time being.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial governor Günther Beckstein may still be in office, question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the Tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the vote, will be decided at an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the critically acclaimed couple have, however, noticed that they are not holding on to their chairs with all their might.
This was an attempt to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "major tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his game, the Christian Social Union had 60.7 percent of the vote, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sovereign" in Bavaria, which contributed 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives continue to hold high in the southern province, which is key to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the change in the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible successor to Huber, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, are part of the small group of scouts who are starting soft talks with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters, who are organized along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition government in Munich.
It is a strange twist of fate that the list of Free Voters includes Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein couple as a coup opportunity, and then mercilessly dealt with by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now devoting all their energies to stabilizing Beckstein somehow.
Stoiber, who has been weaving the strings in the background, will also play an active role in the transition, and the former head of the province and former CSU chairman called 28 September the darkest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some rather harsh remarks about the CDU, saying that they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not somehow brought to its feet by a joint effort.
Merkel, who has been working hard to hide her disappointment at the fiasco, said the CSU's loss of ground would not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Of course, this is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD's 18.6% vote share in Bavaria is the lowest since 1946.
The opposition to Lukashenko: 110-0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is due to the irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the country of 10 million people has been without an opposition legislature for more than a decade, the opposition, united under the name United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), had been hoping that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time after the controversial and fair 2006 elections, would "allow" some opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODSZ thus abandoned the boycott that had been planned in advance.
The opposition's expectations were that Belarus, which had become increasingly economically dependent on Russia - and had taken on the burden of reducing its steadily expensive imports of Russian natural gas and had also helped to put Russian Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines that pass through the country, in its hands - was seeking to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians were denied entry permits because of what they described as an anti-democratic Belarusian political arrangement.
It was a preliminary relief that the OSCE's assessment of the election campaign focused on the positive developments rather than on the shortcomings, such as the fact that a third of the opposition candidates were banned from running.
But the OSCE's Monday briefing also criticized the campaign, which essentially did not allow opposition candidates to appear in the press, and in particular the fact that the opposition was not present at the counting of votes.
However, the opposition says there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have seceded from Georgia, despite the fact that Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Mr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said he wanted to keep it, even though "the power was afraid to let even one opposition member into the parliament".
The opposition is not planning protests in view of the results, but rather is trying to convey a message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- Of course we have many problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in the way of their distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly, - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main achievement, is not considered adequate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
- The country's indebtedness, the growth of the trade deficit is a matter of time before the "quiet of the grave" social security collapse, Milinkevics said.
In contrast to opposition politics, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the CIS mission, told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that "people believe in deeds, not words", so the absence of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work".
In a unique way in the history of Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed to let workers enter and exit.
Starting today, this new policy against tricksters will be enforced, to screen out those who block and then go out for coffee during office hours.
The new anti-daily measure was announced today by Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"Turn-around gates", said Brunetta, "are for better and more efficient work, reducing deficits and increasing services"
"a new era of greater accountability and transparency is coming.
This is real reform", said Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, 'the installation of the revolving door is also symbolically important'.
We have not encountered any resistance from the employees - the General Secretary confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated".
So, no more breakfast on the job, no more coffee and no more broth.
Brunetta smiles and advises, "A good little cappuccino at seven in the morning, it does wonders".
At the Rome School of Public Administration
At a meeting held in the Ministry, the Minister announced that "the number of absentees due to illness in the public sector has fallen by 50% in three months, which means that 60,000 more people are coming to work in one year".
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
"which, according to the Minister, has had wage growth twice that of the private sector over the past eight to ten years, and has far outpaced the rate of inflation".
At the same time, thousands of public servants have gathered to join a petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta decree.
"While the minister of public administration boasts of data to support the reduction of deficits due to the disease, the army of 'tireless dickheads' is constantly growing", writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Across Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working public servants gathered to declare war on the unlawful provisions of the decree".
The regional administrative court is challenged, inter alia, by the abolition of supplementary sickness benefit due to service, the extension of the period of stay at home of employees on sick leave, which is the period within which the sick-visitor may appear, and several other aspects contained in the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is the key
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work-related accidents, 3 of which result in death and 27 in permanent disability.
According to the Occupational Accident Insurance Corporation, in 2007 there were nearly 1,200 work-related deaths.
The figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, with nearly twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is celebrating the Day of the Victims of Work-related Accidents in every Italian province, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the media to this tragic problem.
"The alarming data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm that prevention plays a crucial role in workplace accidents", said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, in a message sent to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workers' Compensation Compensation.
The President of the Republic sincerely praised the 'persistence of the Union in its commitment to workplace prevention, to protecting the interests of workers who have suffered an accident, to helping the families of victims and to making the public more receptive'.
"It is natural and common to be genuinely outraged by tragedies of this nature, which by their magnitude arouse the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we are confronted with dramatic, repetitive events every day".
Napolitano openly admits: 'We are obviously short of funds, and funding for education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at directly informing young people on the threshold of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
We have an obligation to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be lost to the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation to be enacted.
The President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "the seriousness of workplace accidents that cause deaths, the social significance of which we all have a conscience, and the need for institutions to put an end to it as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still staggeringly high", said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want this downward trend to be accompanied by a decreasing attention, because it's when attention is running out that the greatest tragedies happen".
"We believe that at the global level we are still not doing everything that could be done through a comprehensive action programme to combat the phenomenon.
We believe that there should be stricter supervision and control, and more intervention in the area of labour training, starting with school education", emphasised Mr Mercandelli.
'Further efforts are also needed to inform and make the public more receptive,' he added.
What is needed most, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a societal problem".
Mercandelli then criticised 'the gradual deterioration of the protection network for compensation for victims of accidents at work' and the 'direction towards which the system has drifted in recent years'.
"The aim, then, is to restore to the workers the security of insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary or arbitrary measures of the legislators".
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Prolonged exposure to portable devices such as MP3 players, such as the
The European Commission has published a report in Brussels, referring to an opinion published today by the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The study found that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music players at high volume for more than an hour a day for five years may suffer permanent hearing loss", says the explanation.
"It is alarming that young people who use portable music players and mobile phones at high volumes in large numbers and frequently are unaware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing", said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific studies indicate an undeniable risk to which we must respond urgently", added the EU Commissioner.
The main task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information widely.
In the light of that opinion, we should also review the existing control systems to ensure that they operate with adequate efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies.'
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission is ready to explore, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices", said the committee member.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level for portable music players at 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the noise damage caused by excessive use of such sources.
However, solutions exist, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
The EU Scientific Committee's expert opinion states that users of portable devices who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week have a noise level exceeding the current maximum value for noise at work.
If you listen to music for a long time in similar conditions, you're at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects approximately 5-10% of mobile device users, which could be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno is setting up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs through March, results are expected in June.
This is the agenda set by the Metropolitan Government for the "Future of Rome's Capital", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, Commission President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draft the Rome Statute.
The study and plans will be evaluated by the municipal assembly and the municipal committee at the end of March, with a view to submitting the strategic plan for the capital, which will be formally approved by the municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, in June.
'It is a completely independent committee, representing all political, social and cultural views,' emphasises Alemanno, 'and its task is to draw up proposals for Rome's development plans on which the political decision-makers, i.e. the Assembly and the Local Government Commission, can rely.
There is no question of any conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans for the good of Rome could be born.
In March, after the work is done, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed term of office.
We will present a strategic plan in June based on the work of the committee entitled 'The Future of Rome'", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work superfluous, arguing that the expertise it has produced is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard is right, as in France with the Attali Commission, and I am sure it is in Rome, the contribution it makes will be important.
The power of politics is often squandered in the management of daily affairs and the handling of emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, look further and plan for a longer term, taking into account the long-term, and are committed to the development and the future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'water pipe' because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome one euro, but serves as a stimulus and aims to attract the best minds in the capital".
For Alemanno, "we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will allow our city to make the leap of quality it so badly needs, thinking in a unified spirit about its future".
The future, which the Mayor of Rome emphasises as 'not limited to the current municipal framework, but looking much further,' is not only a future metropolis and capital city status, but 'the role that Rome can and should play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean region'.
The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who calls himself an independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, whose decisions wrecked the American economy and cultivated close ties (as he does privately today) with the enemy Islam".
As the election approaches, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A woman in Miami wrote on the Internet, "This man is full of ambition.
Obama boldly believes he can win the highest civil rights dignity in a nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!"
These attacks are really meaningless; they're racist, of course, but they don't answer the question of whether the voters think he's a good president.
In this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their reason.
In the deep South, a newspaper in Mississippi wrote in an editorial: "We know who the true American patriot is in the voting booth.
A side of American thinking that was hidden until the last moment is revealed.
"You can say whatever you want, and we'll know where to put the icons, Obama or McCain".
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Never have words like that been uttered until now, when the black candidate's success is almost assured.
But despite all the talk, the Democratic winning weapon is George Bush.
And when they asked 1,500 people what mistakes they had made during the Bush administration, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and they were whipped the fuck out of their way.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack up.
But most people think that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
There's a huge job ahead for the man who's going to replace George W.
The economic collapse is already being felt by journalists, and it's time for the editorial board to tighten up, and many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists what they thought about the future of their profession and its intellectual power.
Well, at the moment, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not explicitly claim that their concerns regarding the reliability would have been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalism is money.
They see the 2008 crisis as the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the cuts to the newsroom, the editorial offices that produce the newspaper.
If we don't want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands it, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, say the journalists interviewed.
There is a visible and compounded pessimism in American journalism today.
Sixty percent of print media journalists and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic media.
The press has no trouble seeing where the world's web is going.
The largest publishers are making their way onto the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists rose to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists we interviewed admitted that they were voting for technology in the hope that it might help journalism.
There's a gap in the American journalism industry today between the editorial managers, or editors, and the reporters who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of executives are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, while at the local level, the figure is only 23 percent.
Some associate it with a secure job.
Nationally, 47 percent of managers fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, that number is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "safe work" is a constant on the agenda at the team level (in our editors, ed.)
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In a large nation like the United States of 300 million people, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers, employers generally offer as much as they want, so it's a "should or shouldn't" situation.
Directors are generally well paid, and editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and health insurance premiums.
On the other hand, the holiday works on a rather complicated principle: x days in the first year, and in the third year, until, after a certain time, it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all weather related.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 concerning the conditions for the grant of such authorisation.
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second criminal division of the Roman Court, has rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to move from his home in Grottaferrata to a flat in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the investigation into the Unipol-BNL share swap deal.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and it was changed to a restraining order against Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have applied to have the real estate agent transferred from a rural town to his capital apartment.
However, according to the court, these fluctuations (for which the prosecutor had made a motion of refusal) would allow him to influence the company's cases and to have access to the evidence brought against it.
The Elite in Danger
And you could see it a few days ago when the House of Representatives didn't vote on the $700 billion bailout package that the White House put forward, and a significant portion of the American people were more interested, and still are, in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is backed up by yesterday's New York Times reporting that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party, revealing a growing divide between the traditional, conservative East Coast attitude of support for federal institutions and business and the new, anti-Washington and anti-financial world that is growing in the Midwest and South.
This line was critically manifested in the House of Representatives vote mentioned in the introduction.
But this is only one of the many changes that the economic transformation that is still taking place is foreshadowing or making visible, not only in the United States but throughout the Western world and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have been latent for a long time, which are consolidating in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the return of the dual category of state sovereignty to the public consciousness, in connection with a kind of re-empowerment of the economy.
The crisis is affecting banking and financial institutions, which, although they have close links with the rest of the world, are primarily and largely affected by individuals and families who live in one country, one state.
This, in turn, creates a direct political difficulty for those in power to respond to the grievances and protests of the people who are also voters.
So while the crisis may seem global in an economic sense, it is almost entirely national in a political sense.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially stranded beyond the shore: the European Union is a clear example of this, which, floundering between different interests and divergent national strategies, is unable to set a unified political direction.
So everyone is waiting for the national governments to intervene, to provide a bailout, to resuscitate and to set new rules, but above all to open up the money markets: because in a tight situation, only the individual states have the economic resources, the financial reserves, that might be able to make things right.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation will ever have in such quantity.
The new emphasis on the nation-state in the context of the crisis is also fully consistent with the fact that recent economic growth has given greater importance to a factor closely linked to this element: territorial dimension.
And paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network, the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we were suddenly forced to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not at all abstract, like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, yet are completely tied to a particular place, a particular area.
So the person who dominates the territory has a lot more cards than the person who unfortunately was born in a place where there is no crops, no oil and no water.
And that brings me to the second innovation, which is a kind of a breakthrough.
When you say territory, state, government, you are necessarily saying politics, or in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two interlocking phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition that we need authentic leadership, people who can take charge of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the business leaders, have been completely discredited, they have proven to be completely incompetent and they have proven that there is still a lot of uncertainty ahead.
The two together have a deeper meaning and are in some ways more disturbing: the sense of loss of trust, impatience, incompetence and alienation that is affecting the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
So it seems that there is a growing belief among the general population that the era of the social elite, which was at its peak, is over, that it is over before they can adopt their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, and that the social elite is becoming increasingly alienated from the majority opinion.
In other words, the need for leadership, in its veiled form, is fueling a widespread but strong delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system, which is manifested in unexpected "uprisings" of voters, or in recent times in sudden shifts in public sentiment, such as the rise to power of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the unity of the workers' party in Britain, or the revolt of the US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, its programs, and, one might even say, with its habits, its press and its elite intellectuals, is becoming less and less able to understand and therefore less and less able to represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time.
Yet, to speak of "the revolt of the masses on the threshold" would be an exaggeration, to be frank.
But it's not a bad idea to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk on the walls with super-strong adhesive.
Using super-strong adhesive to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
That's the goal set by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
With a mere one-and-a-half-inch-square piece of adhesive, the researchers were able to stick a 300-pound [100 kg] body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
THE American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team invented was developed from a pre-existing material with a special structure called carbon nanotubes.
"We should think of the glue as a kind of a bag of spaghetti-like glue", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers drew inspiration from the gecko's legs, which are covered with microscopic scales that provide the animal with a perfect grip.
Tests on materials such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the talpa of these reptiles, but it "easily breaks off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material may be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Could we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less glamorous use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good conductors of heat and electricity.
It could have other applications in space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
A NEW type of adhesive is being tested at the University of California, Berkeley.
According to an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, scientists in California have demonstrated a hairlike adhesive made of a microscopic fiber that self-cleans as it moves across a surface, always providing perfect adhesion.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not allowed with fruit juice, and that is not allowed with fruit juice.
You have to be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in the summer, when they are taken with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption, potentially enhancing or reducing their effects, which can have serious health consequences.
The risks of using canned or fresh fruit juices with certain medicines have been brought to the attention of David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario, London, who reported at the 236th annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange, or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has been on the list of defendants before, when it was found to be capable of increasing the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiolytics, painkillers, and nerve agents to levels considered toxic.
Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official bulletin, warning doctors and patients to take seriously the risks of such concomitant use and to be careful about taking medications such as Diazepam or Methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers believe that orange and apple fruits also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
The list of substances that inhibit absorption by grapefruit and other fruit juices is long.
This is what Michele Carruba, a professor of medicine at the State University of Milan, points out: "Discoveries of this kind are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, which, if necessary, make sure that the information on the leaflet is changed.
Therefore, always read the package insert of the medicine you are going to take and if you do not understand something, do not be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist", emphasized the Ansa specialist.
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the territorial relationships between trade patterns and economic activity.
55-year-old neo-Keynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an op-ed in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more fateful consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has been the subject of much debate, and has been criticized by economists on several occasions, but we now know it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and a little shocked, that the public interest has moved beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom", said Krugman in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist" but he also has a "very aggressive style in criticizing the Bush administration's over-liberalism".
Open Office, third edition, is now worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, we're releasing OpenOffice.org 3.0, a personal productivity suite of open source applications that are a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting a wider range of users, from home users to office users, from freelancers to government employees.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers and supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is bringing several new features to the public: in addition to the welcome screen and a newly designed, less spartan user interface, it also offers several important new features, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so that Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some of the module's specific features are also interesting, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which can be useful for sending files by email, and the ability to import PDF files into the graphics module while maintaining the page layout.
In this interface, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text editor.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the sharing of workbooks, but prevents overwriting of each other's work.
Some companies are already working to make some of the OpenOffice features available on the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after appearing on the mirror pages since Friday, is now available alongside the English version, which can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The package is available for Linux in addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
You can also get the installation CD at home or at work.
The biggest draw for home use is probably free, but the Open Office suite is now trying to catch up with the business sector, as it has a number of government and school projects to look forward to.
There is also no shortage of ideal training, consultancy and service services for SMEs, which can open up new business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a text editor compatible with Word; Calc, a spreadsheet manager intended to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint-type presentations; Dbase, the most familiar, similar to the Access database manager; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but considering that we are already approaching 3.6 million by the time the new version comes out, that number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's tested positive, and this is his fourth case of doping.
In the final stage of the Tour de France, Bernhard Kohl of Austria, who was part of the Gerolsteiner team, again set a positive example by winning the best climber's jersey alongside the bronze.
The news was published on the Equipe Internetes newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth such competitor, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany, also a Gerolsteiner, who tested positive in the Cera test for the third generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests in the last few weeks, was tested by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from competition for two years according to the regulations.
The news of Kohl's positive third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, who told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was able to finish behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the best alpinist's dotted jersey.
The question is, is he a racist?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to a popular destination for reluctant immigrants.
This is the question posed by the New York Times, which, following the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young Burkinabe who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a lengthy article to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions have "the strongest integration and employment", while "anti-immigration and pro-Northern League sentiment" is strongest in the country.
The NYT cites incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno as evidence of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants.
I did.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the immigration cage and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were also touted as an example of the mood change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also highlighted this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI met with Benedict in the Quirinale Palace and proposed that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism".
Students suffer from skyrocketing rents, with rooms costing up to 900 euros
The market for student accommodation is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest estimates by the Sunia Union of Renters, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such staggering proportions that, because of the enormous total costs to families, it is depriving large numbers of students of the opportunity to study", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price-fixing process has been set in motion against local residents".
In most cases, the property offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts without a rent limit, linked to a sub-lease.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the tax system of the PRC is in a similar state to that of the Union.
The survey details show that in Milan, the Brianza area charges up to 450 euros for a single bed; single rooms range from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) and can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350 to 400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where most students live in the neighbourhood close to the university, a single-bed bed costs 250/280 euros for a two-bed room and 370-500 euros for a single-bed room.
In Rome, in areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), the price is around 600 euros for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€ 550 for a single room) in the vicinity of the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs, you can save a little: a bed costs 300 euros, and a single-bed room 450 in Prenestina, Centocelle, and other similar districts.
In Naples, beds cost between 300 and 450 euros, and rooms cost between 400 and 600 euros.
In Bari, a bed costs 250/350 euros, and a single room at least 350.
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms but have a greater weight in the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, another anomaly is found: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30% higher than that charged to Italian tenants.
Goodbye, old Cinema Paradiso, the cities are past the age of the old cinemas.
Traditional movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
The images, shot by director Giuseppe Tornatore, are a powerful way of showing what is happening in the big cities, but also in the rural regions of Italy.
The displacement of cinemas - the rise of large, multiple-screen cinemas in the suburbs and the consequent decline of single-screen cinemas in the city centres - is a seemingly inevitable and irreversible process, but it also bears all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it is as if a friend had left, an acquaintance with whom we shared a journey and many experiences", says the director of Cinema Paradiso.Tornatoré, which won an Oscar and the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival 20 years ago, tells the story of a small-town movie lyric, the longing for a cinema experience that may have been lost forever.
The figures from the largest operator association, Anec, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, with the biggest losses in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions were Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the multiplexing of the cinema is responsible for their disappearance is proved by the fact that it is in these three regions of Italy that the number of new multiplex cinemas has increased the most: in the last five years, the number of cinemas has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same number in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of cinemas in Italy has increased in an irrational way", says Anec president Paolo Protti. "It is right to build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a city cinema closes, not all those who attend are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the uncharged financial funds intended to support operators: the State's outstanding debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is an ethical and moral disgrace that the government does not respect the laws in force.
The market would require between EUR 16 and 18 million per year to maintain.'
The case of Bologna is particularly noteworthy, as it is the first Italian city to have decided, in the face of its concerns about closures, to address the problem by means of an agreement between the Municipality and Anec, in order to protect and promote the cinema sector in the city centre and in the outskirts.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: spectators could enter restricted areas and park at a reduced rate in certain car parks.
"I like this initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, perhaps by introducing other measures.
But it's also clear that traditional theaters, in order to be able to take on the multiplex dominance, will have to improve their sound and image quality, because today's audiences are much more demanding.
The preservation of the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that finally made me do Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been in Rome for 25 years, so when I'm walking down the Via Nazionale, past the Rialto, or the Quirinale, which is closed, so as not to see the dust-black posters, I turn my head.
The narrowing of the political and 'ndrangheta, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro has supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in the municipal decisions".
Serious charges have been laid by the judges of the Mafia Control Board of Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of outside involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
Bilincs was also handed over to Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and to the boss's nephew, a lawyer of the same name, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a Mafia-like criminal organisation and was awarded €10 million in damages.
"Disregard for all legal and moral norms, and even for good taste", state prosecutors wrote.
"The clan would have been formally admitted to the town hall, which would have given it more control and control over the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the regional assembly of Calabria, makes no secret that there are "many collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But many local politicians resist the 'ndrangheta's pressure, and they are the heroes who remain pure".
This morning's arrests are a continuation of the events of July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to run the municipality.The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was dissolved once before in 1991, again because of alleged links between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor who was re-elected in the 2006 elections, was elected in the second round to lead the centre-right coalition.
He made a scandal when the County Court ordered the dissolution of the Municipal Committee.
He summoned the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnini, to appear before the court, accusing him of having orchestrated the whole thing for political purposes, but the court, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan dared to demand changes to the A3 project.
The warrant against Dal Torrione, state prosecutors wrote, showed that "he was willing to comply with the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs, known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the clan".
That energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy that covers 70 percent of the planet's surface and is only now being discovered by the major international energy companies.
Waves, ocean currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have set their sights on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
For a hundred years, scientists have been exploring the possibility of harnessing the power of the ocean's movements.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using offshore energy was abandoned, but today environmental concerns and the renewed rise in oil prices are giving new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind turbines.
That's twice the amount of energy produced by nuclear power plants today.
Besides, there'd be currents and tides.
The giants are in action.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy, signing an agreement in 2005 for a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are now voting for marine energy, including those who until now have been committed supporters of conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean-based energy technologies and is considering working with us", a spokesman for one of the U.S. oil giant's joint ventures told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a license issued by the US Energy Commission for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is not insignificant, especially when you consider that the United States is drilling for oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan to drill for more.
Besides Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also pursuing offshore energy, and the amount of money invested so far, as far as the details are known, is indicative of growing interest.
The technology is still being developed.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, simply because the energy from the sea does not dispel concerns about its environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal and Scotland, are all small and therefore not very problematic for the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities are needed that also have a greater environmental impact.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power uses an interconnected buoy system, for example.
The shock of the waves that moves the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by the piston and cylinders.
The pressure drives a turbine, which drives a generator.
Electricity is carried to land by undersea cables.
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning stages, all of which are awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating power for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six subsea turbines located in New York's East River estuary.
When the water is in the flow, the turbine rotates, and this rotation powers the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are just waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
Waves and waves.
At present, the opportunities that tidal currents offer deserve special attention.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and thus can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, Alaska, and other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to harness the power of tides, and that number is projected to grow to $35 million in 2009.
