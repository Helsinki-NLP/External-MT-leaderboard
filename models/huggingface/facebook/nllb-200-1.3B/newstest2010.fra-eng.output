Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The award, medal and check of $1.4 million will be given to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October from 172 individuals and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in a solemn ceremony in the afternoon, when Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive the award, but only the third to be presented with the prize in the Committee's own hall.
The White House informed us in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this topic because he's aware that he's getting this award for being a president who's waging war in two countries right now.
He stepped up the war effort just a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for 10 million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He plans to donate it to charity but has not yet decided which one.
His busy schedule then took him and his wife to a banquet that included the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government, and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to accept that price at first.
For example, he mentioned feeling that he was not fully deserving.
He also repeatedly stated that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the very beginning of the announcement, he said that he would be "calling for action".
A conservationist accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police have charged the president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Protectors with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and demanded money from investors for his personal gain in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for Litoměřice police.
The chairman of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
The waste sorting bins in Brno are not good
In Prague, anyone can sort out their beverage packages, whereas in the villages of South Moravia you can find sorting bins on every street corner.
What about Brno?
You would have to take several minutes to find the right containers.
I'm not saying that we shouldn't sort waste in Brno.
But I feel that the city councils of our second largest city in the country are not paying enough attention to this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting, not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but also because of the number of waste bins.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle downtown?
It's a science, and it takes time and nerve.
The only place I've found so far is Moravian Square across from Potrefena Husa.
I don't want to be angry with Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that doesn't sound like much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinekure either.
So, finally, a lot of my friends don't sort their garbage.
I was lazy.
It's a long way to the dumps.
I'm not surprised they did.
I myself, after a party, I suggested that we go and throw away some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any colored bins on Kunicova Street.
Luckily, I found the right place to go on the tram.
But the garbage was overwhelming.
After all, it's the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably because ecology and a supposed aestheticism are not of much interest to the socialists in Brno.
They would rather buy the city a place in the top hockey league which is a disgrace to the city all over the country, than buy a few extra cans and offer to sort more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging around for a while on the Internet.
According to data from the EKO-KOM company, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has removed pension and sick leave from the budget
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even civil servants there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the state debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they relied on the government borrowing for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "This is just postponing the problems, undermining the ground", said Janota.
It is important to know that interest on borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state really has no choice in where to get the money.
If he doesn't cut social welfare or spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those who have been raised by the left at the moment: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and they won't have to worry about their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have gone.
But at the expense of greater public debt - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditure.
The State will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or to reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
We are also short of five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections where it is not possible to modify the projects to possibly reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major projects, and the collection of EU funds is also at risk, warned Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very cleverly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electricity), which is majority owned by the State, and will feed the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and it is by no means a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion was shipped from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And that's not the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation schemes for victims of Communism and crime, even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save on the department side or, in the worst case, on the government's budgetary reserve.
The project to set up a two-billion-dollar state fund, which should allow the online monitoring of the expenditure of each administration, also lacks 100 million.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will be imposed, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems.
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another with the press of a button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
With just one click, you can go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the American company VMware, which is mainly engaged in the development of virtualization software for computers.
We're going to let you manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate between personal and professional.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which ran the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is currently working with European and US carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices in 2012.
Mountain snow shortage worries hotel owners
The problem of abandoned runways is not confined to the operators of climbing roads.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find rooms available for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Day.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People are browsing the offers, asking for prices but not committing to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud on Christmas", said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate too much to book.
If you prioritize savings and the quality of accommodation comes second, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in Špindler offer only one week's stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to place them for a while longer, but they will give in too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of vacant rooms will rapidly decrease", Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting week for us right now, it's not completely sold out.
There's still, say, half the rooms left in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays", said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are just as good, the remaining winter stays are selling out moderately.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will be complete too", Schiefert thinks.
In contrast, the occupancy of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We've got a few last places left for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well too", says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázně is also 80 percent full during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half the beds are empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, when we have already 60 per cent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly increase further, said Omnia hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, hotel owners in the Krkonoše Mountains should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowing in the mountains.
But after that, the weather should warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is even comical that Barack Obama, a well-known and wise president, has made a determined effort to repeat the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he finally let out his long-awaited doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it onto carbon paper from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A New Road Forward".
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed, so much so that the newspapers at the moment do not mention Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a far more favourable final position than could have been hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who demanded an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even sharply criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He was asking for 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but for lack of a better option, he at least swindled the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in getting the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on 10,000.
What seems to be causing the most problems in the whole Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving of the increase will produce the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is the exact opposite - no one is counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are used to changing leaders from day to day as they see fit.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain as a powder-for-the-eyes, behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity on the relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state of emergency", which is the basic aim of the operation, does not seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzling by its voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and it is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and unrealistic heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "immediate return home" will bring about a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will view it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The recent NATO summit showed that the European willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is heading in the wrong direction.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor which can radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of resolving the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will be able to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only problem for Obama is that he has three years until the presidential election and therefore still has enough time to devise a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a complete fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to sell for five years.
Shares can be taken away from executives if they take too much risk.
Goldman Sachs is leading the way in the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street, according to Reuters.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global direction to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after it set aside nearly $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was planning to impose a single tax of 50 per cent on bankers' bonuses above £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
The five women, a record number, have today received the Nobel Prizes in technical sciences and literature from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with fellow American Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research on chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom, along with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are now the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of acquisition of the prize money.
The total amount of the aid is SEK 10 million in each category (approximately EUR 1.1 million).
If there are more than one winner, they will split the prize among themselves.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, the President acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to achieve peace, even if it costs a lot.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Representatives.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the deficit was too large, which further exacerbated the public finance crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation which will be submitted for Klaus' signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday endorsed the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the austerity package passed by the Fischer government, which he says should curb government debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficit" of public finances.
He now believes that there is no good solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
The SDS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is staggering and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of the SDS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the SDS, the SDS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The leader of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is playing Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincible will expose the world to many things about the country, its struggles and victories.
History is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the apartheid regime in South Africa and the country's first black president.
Freeman said it was a 91-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm going to play you, I should be able to see you in person.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's boxing-centric drama Million Dollar Baby, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who became a slave himself, a fictional U.S. president, even God in the film Evan Almighty, but someone who is still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby team captain François' joint efforts to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country is still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders of the world ranking.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake her hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I'm getting some of your energy, it's getting through, and I feel like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to be someone else.
Matt Damon stars in the film as François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby's tough environment.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the baton of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the ratings of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway solved: the Russians tested a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again a failure and the "Bulava" type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian military is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava either didn't fly, or it was damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers are talking about "Bulava" as "missile that does not fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was going on normally at first.
It wasn't until the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It's obviously the third-floor rocket engine that exploded.
This time, the Bulava flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
The Norwegians, moreover, did not for a moment doubt that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, there is no such thing as failure.
The first two stages of the rocket held, and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines have failed on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This almost fifty percent success rate fills the generals with optimism and they still claim that one day Bulava will fly without problems and will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will once again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world, olympic and Stanley Cup champion will lend his hand to his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his debut already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who retired at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to work out some details about the form, says the club's coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP.
It was not made clear whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will be for just one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov would become the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov quintet, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the Soviet Union's flag he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as the Junior World Championship.
In the latter part of his career, he also earned honors in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that's why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz website reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be allocated at a later date for the working day of 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they get the extra for the overtime, or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their year-end holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport and lunch expenses.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot topic in the comments and demands of unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work two hours overtime on top of their usual eight hours almost every day.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the car factory management and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation in the factory reached a peak last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged bribery.
The management defended itself by saying that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements of automobile production.
When announcing the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a remuneration of 5 000 crowns (about € 209) for these this year.
The Hyundai automobile plant in Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people.
It started serial production last November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles as of September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hard" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality is, in some cases, overridden by the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
There is no cure for AIDS at present.
However, a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body can dramatically extend the lives of patients.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses that no longer have any effect on medicines.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University, paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a way different from any drugs used so far and therefore could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work led them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding to virus proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus by the HIV protease there would be no generation of mature infectious virus particles.
If the protease of HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explain the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes and on resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the current version of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it is not weaker than on resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of further chemical modification, are therefore interesting combinations to be further investigated in the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Structural Biology Laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The SDS is going after Fischer, who is defending himself.
The chairman of the SDS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget ratified for the following year as "terrifying" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDGs's statement a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
SDS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, SDS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDGs and the Social Democrats on the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, but the left included amendments of 12 billion crowns.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the running of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of DKK 163 billion.
The SDGs left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget be a less bad alternative to an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will reflect further on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign if the amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his move to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would continue in his position.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those on health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the SDG are not in question.
This is a matter for the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are complaining about TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the size of the public budget deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he bases himself on the left majority that is currently in the House".
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda then I'll focus on it, said from the Chamber to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in this afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDGs backed down at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also stressed that the SDGs would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if they had not specifically asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, he said when asked whether the SDGs had not been criticised by the party chairman in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew at the time I resigned that what would follow in the months to come would be a Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit some express or regional trains with less traffic from 13 December and will reinforce some others.
Total transport coverage will be reduced on the day of the new timetables by two per cent compared with today.
Most fares will not change, including the basic fares and the discounted fare.
For example, the people of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, and the railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line, the direct Prague-Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At regional level, the greatest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent overall, while Prague and its environs can expect an increase.
Two overnight trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, Milovice residents have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The Czech Republic will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill for regional railways this year: 200 million crowns more.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion crowns to cover the visible losses, the same amount as this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have just signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration has always been one year.
The railways are pleased with the system, which is also why they have not used a price increase on the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discount internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the journey, whereas until then it was valid between cities in a chosen region and was a single tariff of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
Rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was reported by AFP, but originally only spoke of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, along with one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields in a run-off from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find a deal for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence during a settlement between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre in connection with the election of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao also has active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film is coming to theaters in the next few days, titled Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has gone back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been given to Matt Damon.
As the film arrived in theaters, the feedback from critics and audiences was heard.
Nelson Mandela is a
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the World Cup, and also because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to AP, the reaction to the new film is so far rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the leading roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, in his own words, proud of the film.
I've been dreaming of this role for years and I've been preparing myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally so that I could - as they say - get some energy from him, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the rugby national team jersey
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin, the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial groups from a long-divided population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he wears the South African national team jersey on the field of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in a T-shirt, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long applauded fourteen years ago by mainly white audiences and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully, the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black player on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently told LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A tens of millions of crowns' worth of transformer in flames in the Louny area
A fire in the morning engulfed a transformer of the Čeps company at the distribution centre near the town of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí Fire Department, there are six units working on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn out, but they changed their minds and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical malfunction, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of kroner, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps has not experienced anything like this and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, says ČEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, and the operation of households, government offices and industries was not affected by the fire at the power plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of the 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission to distribution systems and lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura to file defamation complaint against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint today against three Social Democratic prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura reported this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them have attacked us and claimed that we are making a big deal, when we only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for the slander against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
It also stated that it had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint lodged by Mr Jančura is the continuation of his media show which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I think this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating public opinion and using false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed us last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement which will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after New Year's Day.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust Czech Railways with the operation of the railway lines for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a ČSSD member of parliament.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we might lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Tumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
The pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at a high point.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurances will pay.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
Another shot.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born from 2 August last year can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the next vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet parents paid $1,500 or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurers spend between $500,000 and $500,000 a year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now the State has spent about 500 000 crowns a year on all vaccinations for children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the 'Janota package'.
Pneumococcus is the cause of middle ear inflammation but also of serious infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, pneumoconiosis infections have caused the deaths of up to 28 children under the age of 10.
Apart from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are suggestions that vaccination may be required in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Association Rudolf Kalovský said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference our association attended, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that is the direction we should now take, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health doesn't want to change the process of vaccinating against pneumococci.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Doctors say that optional vaccination has its drawbacks.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination is flawed.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be envisaged. "In a situation where the vaccine costs so much I understand the decision to make vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
The pneumocoke vaccination is also a breakthrough in that it is the first vaccination of children to be funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to concerns among pediatric practitioners about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other government-provided vaccine products.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurers to "deduct health insurance amounts".
So doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to invest about 40 000 crowns a month in vaccines, which is a large sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum robbery"
The son of renowned illustrator Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force their way into the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
The AP quoted a police official as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such a permission, the agency said.
Labour is in favour of raising the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also attracted the attention of the public by tackling low and medium wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% in Social Security and a cap rate of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The wrath of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were being penalized by a recession for which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were looming.
The reduction in Social Insurance - which will bring in around £3 billion a year - has angered the business world, as it is a tax on jobs when the objective should be to boost the economy.
The increase, which is reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect some 10 million workers.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a draft budget for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.
Social insurance will increase by a further 0,5% from April 2011
The economy will shrink further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies was abandoned
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 a year will gain £110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 entailed "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted any increase in tax and stressed that a reduction in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared with what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will need to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of the Labour "debt crisis", said the plan to borrow £789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which are due in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, chief secretary to the Treasury of the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it".
"The important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and the other
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the next cuts, unlike the Tory proposals which would lead to a faster and more substantial reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems argued that the money raised through the tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC political editor, claimed that the timing of the announcements - such as the inflation increase for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing charges of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional aid is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget" is the name of the game.
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending constraints would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually postponed", said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of who wins", added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
FBI investigating "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as having Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are US citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are and what the conditions are", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokeswoman for the FBI, said the agency had been made aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house was already being watched by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States should "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the terror infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their home in northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses" of the peace process
Human rights have been violated more than ever in the past 20 years, says a report by Amnesty International.
The report shows "repeated violations" by the regime, both before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC's correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International has reported on the case of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and judiciary should set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park trail, a small springboard preceded a 100-foot-long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the runway was beautiful but that the runway was quite intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the city lights glittering down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best volts - or figures - on the track.
After the Thursday night party, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and the other
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like the Scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for some fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country at the moment.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims in France.
He is very good at listening and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should evolution and gay rights be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They're not going to get the debate through.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their counterparts advocating a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today constitutes a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of both sides.
He wonders how committed French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulently guarding secularism) really are to pluralism.
He said that Muslims were not corrupted by Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowing of key values".
After reading this book, you're tempted to say "yes, but not yet".
The world's darkest sight
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it up is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Ice Sheet", author and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He is an expert on the history and complicated policies of whaling and describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The encounter with Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspiring soldier who had only the tip of his musket to fight with, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The cubs, caught swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, a famous show included 75 bears at a time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is still generally one millionth of the area needed for an adult in the wild. The climate is rarely indicated: A polar bear living in Singapore turned green because of the algae growing in its thick fur.
For more information, click here.
Mr. Ellis recounts the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motor-skiing are using powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a fascinating glimpse of what the future might hold there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately describe the speed of these changes.
It's not for lack of trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages provided the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
Submarines of the Cold War then mapped the changes in terrain underneath it.
Satellite monitors and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary, tiny world of the Arctic ice sheet, formed by the seams of brine pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, predicted between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
First-class DeAngello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who once stood in their place.
In a few months, from where we are sent, we may be in their place, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in different sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, started the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way, to hold commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and at the site of the memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked among the lawns and rolling hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose old graves, from World Wars I and II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as frequently visited as the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was upbeat, with children playing and couples holding hands, carrying fresh pine crowns over the gray graves.
Each round crown was dark green, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Nearby, there was silence over Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying openly, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stone while others bent over to see the little black and white information cards, buried in the wet earth for those whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers weeping at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to collect herself at the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him".
An American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen for distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the US State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but was denied permission.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desirable consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones, which are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that is equivalent to a day's pay.
Internet access is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
It's rare to see an American detained in Cuba.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arresting and detaining him is a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an alleged organization plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting down a hidden insurgent figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving of the terrorist waves on the Internet video site YouTube.
When they arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not part of the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast, which had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a spokesman for the authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry into al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters act as barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
Analysts say potential American recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to be more careful in recent years in choosing who they accept as the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many others have already followed?
The pattern is the one that's increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets here on Saturday, demanding greater climate action from the negotiators working at the Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but police estimates were 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, holding up signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has had enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that a trip to her mother's native Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening".
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the Great March -- to spread the word and to call on world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, the activists, wearing masks and black clothes, lit several explosive devices near the main canal in Copenhagen which is surrounded by several ministries.
They were dropped near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Assembly Hall, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought a protest would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He noted that walking could seem harmful or beneficial depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others".
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal math report brought good news for D.C. public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African-Americans and whites, at both the local and national levels.
The average grades of white fourth-graders in Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success rate actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Progress among African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The six-year outlook is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) classrooms, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by school board director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were being driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we've raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in D.C. education.
I don't jump for joy over a point or two", said Kwame R. Brown (a Democratic relative), D.C. Councilman, whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But the scary thing is that we don't spend enough time and energy in our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the late primary and early secondary grades who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math curriculum for Kindergarten through 6th grade emphasizes real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former District Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions to these students below the level of the classroom", Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system performance while providing money and resources for schools with lower performance to close the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of California, Berkeley who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and your management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like all the other school superintendents, she tries to take advantage of the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children can get a good public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to closing the achievement gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in Washington District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" for getting another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks at the white columns, brick facades, and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
So when she and other Grade 8 students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less one of an impressed than enthusiastic new student.
"This is great, I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, as the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
"Youpi, really?" she said thoughtfully, when she was told of the low law professor-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh place the kids visited on their three-day discovery trip, and now they had completely incorporated the message: It's not a question of whether you go to college:
The question is where.
While this question is still widely asked by the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have dropped out of high school and become parents in their teens, hundreds of thousands are also receiving university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five second-generation Hispanics are continuing their education at high school - a remarkable achievement when you consider that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, as they pave the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study fighters say that fighters have a natural affinity for school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are consistent and long-term.
When you look at children in low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to organize college-preparatory programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Wins Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Ministry of Oil has obtained with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone back with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who bid lost.
Two American companies won contracts for the fields that were auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news website.
It's gonna be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops withdraw have held back US oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, US companies were at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, which had significantly lower labour costs and were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided it with their technical advice, have gone back empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and has emerged with significant holdings in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids which were then compared to the barrel price that the Ministry was willing to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda is reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile that hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of al-Qaeda's operational planners this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired from their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by a drone of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civil intelligence officer, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Officials said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally dismembered bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US counterterrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the senior military organizers of al-Qaeda who directed the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the officials who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed strategic instructions from al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second US official said that Somalia had advanced rapidly in al-Qaeda's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but that doesn't diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaida or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, along with three other operatives.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures provided by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have made progress in reducing their vulnerability while also mercilessly killing suspected informants, the website says.
UN special envoy to Kabul resigns
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term marred by widespread corruption allegations during the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the deployment of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
Military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor the pledge he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to alert the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The officials say that the names of Staffan di Mistura, an Italian-Swiss national who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations, have been mentioned.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and of concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was thanked - "have hurt the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism regarding international election observation".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the US and other Western countries than he is assigned to the Afghanistan mission, saying it would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of her powers in Afghanistan, saying that the UN's heavy hiring regulations hampered her opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subjected to additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a contingent of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that really weighs on me is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it's the unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranian street people.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from such sanctions.
In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear test solely for peaceful purposes.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust on both sides and to buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempted deals - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's toughness on some of the international community's proposals that they actually agreed to in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to agree on what they hadn't considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31st as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhanced sanctions".
In a statement issued Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce potential conflict to avoid any delay in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm Kurdish anxiety about the pending withdrawal, and US officials have quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you".
Changing Directions in an Ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching, "Mother Earth is too tired to take in more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They learned so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, changed course dramatically this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child. Their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We've already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left", said Wang, 31, human resources director and father of an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy, which created two generations of notoriously unique children with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has fallen from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of around 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent future labour shortages".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, though - as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A gradual easing
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is by far the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and facing discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where the man and woman are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that central government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent out family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and to place leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the answer was disappointing.
The disappointing answer
While officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications for records of couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported no change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem isn't just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us".
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others".
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class working-class couples who are driving down the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have that lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even an only child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write their resume to get a place in the best kindergarten".
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back into the spotlight on Friday, due to the release of a paper highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations taking on most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as providing some guidance on the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in the time-strapped negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The report, written by a special UN task force, does not say how much the rich countries will give to the poor to cope with the ongoing and long-term global warming.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies might reduce their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate change executive secretary general Yvo de Boer described as "the complete picture".
It outlines the guidelines for a possible agreement whereby the industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would, over the same period, reduce their own by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US representative at the climate negotiations, rejected any discussion of the need for greenhouse gas reductions by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not stress enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top US negotiator was either lacking in "common sense" or "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, gaps have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The battle is now more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States bickering over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now unified and are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became urgent as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government could reach agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their planes and rushed to the Bella Center building for closed-door meetings and briefings, so they could make claims that would be studied over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people are coming in and out of the convention center every day -- activists playing guitars performing nightly shows mocking countries they say are betraying each other and proposals are being written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 140 miles per hour will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 Monday morning, a whistle will sound through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transportation revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, running from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate into an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburbs, business travel times will be much shorter, and the shift from air and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road traffic congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties are in favour of this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle over timing and fears of environmental hazards could slow Britain's high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the map will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final route.
It is also envisaged that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y-shaped configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will run through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option", said one railway professional.
When it's finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a current one-hour journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK's network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London to Birmingham line.
A terminal capable of handling 20 000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built piece by piece.
Trains will first be forced to run off existing high-speed lines on the railways north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This seems to be the best way to ensure that trains and airplanes are in line, and is a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers repay £75,000 loan to the Tory orange shop
Alan Duncan, the leading Tory member of parliament, made the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orange shop he built in his riding house.
The party official who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "kept in touch" has increased his £75,000 loan to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who monitors members' expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland-Melton constituency.
The neighbouring houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing in a recent inquiry by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his advance borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal security of the £271,406 loan from his London estate to the home in his constituency which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in interest on borrowings until March last year.
In April, his requests increased by over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS standard variable interest rate has risen from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year and has remained unchanged since.
The latest release from the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's national now, you have to live on a budget and you're treated like a "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small share, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for a hell of a lot more, but I didn't".
The MP, a millionaire from his former job as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May after it emerged he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved by both the Expense Office and Legg".
He added: 'There is no problem with dodging or making or using the rules or anything.
It was very clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler".
All you faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. daily, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why are we as a church waiting for people to walk into an old strange building? It seems to me that the church should get closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea for the Advent calendar for the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality".
Strong climate action in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement on combating global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, and 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is set to conclude by Friday with an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global climate mobilization, as illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP reporter noted.
Riot police immediately intervened without mercy.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mostly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had made their mark at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "indistinguishably", noting that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold.
Party of Parliament, the fairly good-child procession, headed for the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the speakers scheduled for the ceremony, before a candlelight vigil attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them in rain-proof blue skies, had formed a first-morning rally in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt to the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no separation between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had triggered the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organisers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, holding banners celebrating solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of several hundred protesters were also held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organised by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, as Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first vote after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout rate was 58 percent a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the incumbent President, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
This election is a sham.
Meanwhile, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-93 conflict, which left thousands dead, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in the capital city of Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region of sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea coast.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch with Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are scattered throughout this tiny territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who had come to monitor the election process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations", said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, holding up a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the polls by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive protest.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, and about 100,000 according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which until December 18 hosts delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should come into force on January 1, 2013.
The party of Parliament, the procession, generally good kid, headed to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the speakers scheduled for the ceremony, before a candlelight vigil attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of several hundred protesters, all dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, smashed windows, an AFP reporter noted.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without mercy, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying that they were mostly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had made their mark at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a paved road and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, police said.
We have our eye on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters circled the skies.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them in rain-proof blue skies, had formed a first-morning rally in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several figures, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had triggered the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organisers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, wearing red and carrying banners praising solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organised by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
The geohistory is strengthened by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were coming out "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, all first-year pupils will have four hours a week and the same programme for a common culture, says Mr Chatel.
The Minister said that "we must stop being hypocritical" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific field" but "basically concentrates the best students".
The ES and L subjects cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing further: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of history-geography as a terminal subject in the technical high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory history-geography teaching in the S-level. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the removal, as did the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The Minister added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilisation on Tuesday to protest the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year, which will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test, which will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also undertake practical training during the M2 year and then spend a first year in front of the pupils as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more time in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister says that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in the National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: this was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of a series of 15-minute expert talks, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that would get people interested and want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the day, which is named after the fish in the school's swimming pool.
He said that about 20 speakers were chosen from among experts in their fields and were selected for their charisma.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes but using graphs, to about 50 people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he stressed, hoping that the audience would remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos from these lectures will be posted on the school website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delayed payments: anger from prison guards, planned actions
Prison overseers' unions called for a "general mobilisation" on Friday to demand the payment of bonuses and overtime by the end of the year, which was postponed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisors' union) asked the staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate in front of the prisons on Tuesday morning and "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization . . . to bring up the dissatisfaction and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime was significantly increased in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but they assure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisors' unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which has resulted from a miscalculation of the number of overtime hours, does not recur in the future, adds Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for the executives who receive the famous bonuses for their duties and objectives, lamented the UFAP/UNSA, for whom "budgetary constraints are a good thing".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille has said, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularised in December, including overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, the CGT-prison of Bordeaux believes.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less badly off than others.
But the point is not that, said Jean-François Forget, secretary-general of the UFAP.
Obama says he's giving "cooler tricks" for Christmas than he's getting
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule about gifts: "I give more cool stuff than I get".
In a special broadcast on ABC Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle give a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the New Year's Eve in their new, prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" get a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama signed off on her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he gets: "Certainly not, I gave you some cool gifts last year", she taunted the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before he replied humorously by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, casual program, with the famous host who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time I met my father who came to visit us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of the dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had all the furniture lined up against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday has undergone surgery, RTL says he's in an artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent further surgery on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after US doctors found "operative injuries" to his herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, adding that the injuries "require reconstructive surgery".
However, the singer's press service was reassuring, saying the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical report would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
When asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drainage was installed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
He was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's news.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said he had "no worries" about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing 12 hours of flying after an operation like that, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, Hallyday's producer Jean-Claude Camus gave himself up for reassurance, saying that Hallyday was "responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling from his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of many, Johnny Hallyday was diagnosed with "a small colon cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66" tour, presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been a topic of much comment, with fans and journalists noticing the singer's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Little Basin: Bousquet's first time at his fetish distance
Frédérick Bousquet, a Frenchman who won three medals at the 2009 World Championships in swimming, won an international title on a distance he particularly likes, the 50m freestyle swim, at the 2009 European Swimming Championships in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, when the combinations are allowed for the last time, saw only three world records broken while waiting for a flood.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in the 200 m 4 swim and the other two by Russia in the men's 4x50 m 4 swim relays.
A pity for Bousquet, who was staring at the world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he holds in the large pool (20.94).
On one of the two main distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won in 20 seconds 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet overtook Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream better, and in that case, I said if the world record was within my grasp, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
The 238 world records since February 2008 are now ending their epic run in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the suits did not help this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the large pool this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400 m freestyle record (3:32.77) but nevertheless won the race with his second-best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up for this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold Thursday for $1.5 million, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 centimeters high, dates from the third century C.E. and was estimated to be worth between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and bacchanas, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antique art auctions at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have bid the most for so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days ago.
The panel remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private hotel, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It was a shadow zone for about 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's failed attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a passport by the coup government.
At the moment, after a late-night phone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for the transfer are not in place, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
After arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its original destination, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad in order to grant him a passport.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to visit Mexico as the visiting head of state.
The coup government "has failed again in wanting me to resign my position . . . they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the fallen president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for a passport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Wednesday to the Honduran radio station HRN.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
He stressed that a possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the fallen president's supporters on Wednesday, who had gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military had strengthened their siege.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
This shows the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had been close to Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his reelection, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had been exiled to Costa Rica, but had returned unexpectedly on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which the government of the coup is accusing him of.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in a controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street up, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up hike Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery in both U.S. and partner activity: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she said, saying that the market was focused on "the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said that investors were focused on the U.S. trade balance, "which shows that business is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared with September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to widen.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is that the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflects the growth in the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new jobless registrations in the United States rose above expectations last week, to 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to its lowest level in a year", noted Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has gone down.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,482% from 3,423% on Tuesday night and the 30-year bond to 4,492% from 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the government are part of the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday burned the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were eaten in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist noted.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Viva Fidel and Raul!" the supporters of power shouted with their fists up to the dissidents.
The women were escorted by plainclothes officers who "provided protection".
The day before, a similar protest against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about 10 dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, an AFP reporter noted.
Police forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles, which were consumed by government supporters, according to this journalist.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", who won the 2005 Sakharov Prize from the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 of whom were dissidents, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in detention.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" for their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, which is ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European and American NGOs of violating human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A maniac stabs an 80-year-old and wounds five in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, at a busy time late Thursday.
According to the initial elements of the investigation, the assailant, aged 28, would have hit with two knives and for unknown reasons, an eighty-year-old, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses learned.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital from his injuries.
In or outside the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his 30's, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person's life is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Two passersby, apparently accidentally, were reportedly injured: one in his 30s and one in his 40s, the latter seriously.
The script was still confusing at night.
He was armed with two butcher knives which he carried in a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a union official in the Hauts-de-Seine.
According to testimonies gathered by AFP, several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the outburst.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn't because the guy was big, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, said.
A crowd ran over him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police sources.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was a person out there who was hurt.
I went outside, saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe position, and saw a very large wound in his abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30's came in, stabbed.
It was the National Police who arrested the man without identification papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office referred the investigation to the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The maniac was admitted to the hospital Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out he's in a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it took six officers to bring him under control at Clichy Police Station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of hyperacctionality" like "all the crazies of this species whose strength is multiplied by the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) the abandonment of the proceedings against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a morals case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", denounced to three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, Mr Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
He said that Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before handing down his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison -- which is a serious procedural flaw.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" by the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally said in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
If the court refused to drop the proceedings, Mr Hummel demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed at first instance, namely that no dismissal of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear for the hearing".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
She said the filmmaker "is asking for favor from the court, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision - also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the escape".
Mr. Hummel wasn't the only one who asked for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be dropped.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client could no longer stand being harassed at every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, held back by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended with no direction Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in tight margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
US consumer confidence also improved markedly in December, to 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
The indices were however held back by a further rise in the dollar, which reached its highest level against the euro in two months, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has gone down.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year bond to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's journey across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross the final line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this big beauty fair held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their tickets for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I have seen and experienced so much! exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 5pm (15pm GMT).
I couldn't have dreamed of a better country to give back my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and is running in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown", Miss India said with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee executive Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on bicycles, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not uncommon for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will probably be the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to promote the event a bit more.
I've been around people I never thought I'd be around.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, said Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday "very positive", according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was to visit his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, he is doing very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who appeared relaxed, said he would be going "very soon" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo further surgery on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to extensive injuries resulting from the operation.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is studying on Friday morning to attend a school performance, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible court proceeding coming up, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had "gone far too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was amazing, considering that I had two herniated discs myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without a drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he's also a doctor with a sulfur-laden reputation, convicted several times by the courts in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who was prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being commendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had "gone perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems to be in parenthesis.
"Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (at Amiens) as planned seems very short", said Camus.
The UDF Association raises its voice and calls on the New Centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to use the acronym of the former Giscard party, warning him not to use it on any media, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to reclaim the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou does not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP and former NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a warning to the minister and the deputy, ordering them to stop using the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the brand to them, under penalty of legal proceedings.
You have made many statements in recent days indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to 'take back' the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to post on your activist material and on the front page of your website the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, the signatories of the letter also note.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which warns the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from any media and from (its) website".
It also asked Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the mark to its legitimate right holders'.
If you do not, the courts will be called to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, in their view, to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the bureau continues, "when he registered the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It is scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the fact that the acronym UDF is not filed to do so on its own behalf.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironically pointing out the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for the abuse of power
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of the eighty-year-old's weakness to spoil part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his celebrity photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by 10 March 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will tell her about it, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
The Court's decision was welcomed by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr Olivier Metzner.
This is excellent news (...) The expert will prove that he (Mr Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been suing François-Marie Banier, a talented photographer and artist, for taking advantage of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or masterpieces.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was considering the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' action, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the big family unpackage on Friday.
For example, the lawyer for Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since he got married".
The Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a custody judge in recent days refused to grant her request to open a legal protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act for him", said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the public prosecutor's representative.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of French large companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was in the past, of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put market-conquest strategies back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors is regularly recurring!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon which affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, in particular R & D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EIA "requires all stakeholders (...) to take a proactive approach and to have a forward-looking view"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees which the authoritarian management recipes totally contradict.
This is why we call for a management revolution that puts employees at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees stimulate this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not at all.
- Firstly, because I have seen that, in the face of a new situation, every structure eventually, after many detours, comes to make priority... what it has always done!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism is one of the pathologies of power - it grows in proportion to the magnitude of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
They come from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They are adopting, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory, recently reactivated by American "neuroscience" and widely disseminated, unbeknownst to them, by the academic institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reassures managers in a posture of mechanistic governance, which is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a finalist view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate into any reasoning or practice of governance a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only the studies resulting from the National Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa which, through their perceived image of the company, enables them to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilising factors, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management "in place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "Just War" is worthy of praise on the right for Obama
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the day before, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had cheered Obama's award on October 9, applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, a right-wing Republican, to the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had addressed the subject of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
War is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
She said we should stop these terrorists right there.
Mr. Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, used the use of force in Oslo on Thursday as a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
"I found this speech to be historic in some ways", said Mr. Gingrich, when interviewed on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former president, who is seen by some as a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a leftist president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if there was no use of force".
Michael Gerson, a former George W. Bush aide who became a columnist for the Washington Post, said Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as he always does, "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they are doing little to preserve it", Mr Gerson said.
Among the few on the right who are not convinced, a Bush-era hawker, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "tender, bulky and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When you wrap war around the notion of justice, you can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praising the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily said.
Mr. Obama "gave the right speech", the New York Times said, calling it "both dark and uplifting".
Roadways: Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" at the agreement, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly by the end of the morning.
This was despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had closed the door.
But it took another six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the holidays", said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wage earners (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% wage increase for the highest wage earners (in international transport).
The hourly rate for low-wage workers is reduced from 8.72 to 9.06 euros.
It is not much, but we are going very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we give our activists orders that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But there may still be some unsatisfied recalcitrants, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the lowest salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is a common-sense agreement and one that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
The Commission is also proposing a new directive on the protection of the environment.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel expenses and for the general road transport report to be published in the first half of 2010, which will allow for the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amending finance bill, which was voted on by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies which are members of this organisation and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
The Commission will be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that the new rules are implemented.
Opposition from employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "marketplace of dupes", as the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in an emergency, not as a result of a shared analysis, but to avoid upsetting the turkey eaters of the coming Christmas Eve, lamented Unostra.
The agreement, he said, "may lead to the grave digging of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transportation line, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium demand.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important pre-Christmas shopping weekend, there will only be trains between 10am and 8pm, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses it from the west and is the Paris urban area.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no noise on the docks, as the Francilians had organized themselves.
In the early morning, the train station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of secondary school and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger, in the Marne Valley, 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he got up "one and a half hours early to make sure he was on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned to train officers and police.
The RERs operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or left the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will consider the results, judged "poor" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RN Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RN A on all aspects, working time, career progression, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The CGT was outraged, pointing out that the RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, pointing out that the management "didn't care to solve a problem whereas the road operators and SNCF did".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "mocked the weekend users".
By morning, some 150 drivers had filled a training committee at the headquarters in Paris.
The management, which had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had then suggested the meeting "in a sense of appeasement".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday, after a notice was filed by Unsa and Independent.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independent) and are complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive between EUR 2 200 and EUR 2 700 gross and between EUR 600 and 650 in premiums for shift work, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with heavy consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the court president Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as un-tagged MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 case initiated by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" to the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's ruling comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community with a series of measures to strengthen their rights, in an attempt to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city with a predominantly Kurdish population.
Police fired tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the court's decision would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of political parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete torpedo on the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
He said that the PKK would, of course, react.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sanding service (FES) says that it is not to bother the citizens.
It's simply so that the officers can test the technique of the vehicles and learn how to properly control them.
And according to the weatherman, it could be this weekend.
Over 300 officers and 120 vehicles are standing by to deal with the snow and ice.
The ESF is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes busy streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire stations, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and steep streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers start their shift at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a solid road foundation in a maximum of 3 hours.
That is why the ESF service starts at 3am "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic starts".
That's where it gets harder, when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This is a problem, says the head of the road clearance and sanding department, "because no motorists are willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, when the snow stops, we take care of the access roads and the service roads - such as Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot team sets out to clear the priority areas and crossings deemed dangerous.
Cycle paths are generally not covered by the ESF.
Mr Brauburger said that there is a special department in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of bridges between 10pm and 4.30am.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles are used as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also call on this special service in times of need.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipedal was about six feet [2.0 m] long and six feet [1.5 m] high, its hind limbs were strong, its elongated skull had sharp, curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws, and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to display these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging land of the supercontinent of Pangaea and was located near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
It tells us about the relationship between relatives, the distribution of these and their characteristics.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating the site of Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a Triassic sedimentary layer.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says that this is a remarkable discovery. The fossils of Triassic dinosaurs are extremely rare, limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not consider this discovery particularly spectacular, but he does say that it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very earliest dinosaurs.
Experts are wondering, among other things, when the saurians split into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores), which include the later tyrannosaur and velociraptor, and from which the birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and their relatives, and the ornithischian herbivores, which include species such as the triceratops and the stegosaur, are descended.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and colleagues, the Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting mix of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence that suggests the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in their bones at the level of the skull, just like the birds that are descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe than for mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also had air sacs and a lightweight skeleton, it is reasonable to assume that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurian had appeared there.
So the three major evolutionary lines split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the land that emerged to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The researchers argue that the three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that migrated.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the journal Science Studies says that there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a Bonn paleontologist, says that there is an even older species, the sillesaurus, that lived in what is now Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
He said that this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved whereas there are hardly any on other continents.
However, how dinosaurs, which came from a relatively rare collateral lineage of the reptile branch, managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age, remains a mystery to this day.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the planet, fostering the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not permanent.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction event where dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have gone extinct.
Or maybe the dinosaurs were better adapted and so they were able to eliminate competition in the field.
At any rate, such success is not permanent.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite helped to develop a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and had been shadowed since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signers from all over the world.
There are those of professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers at the Universities of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt has caused waves around the world.
278 professors and lecturers from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions from Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the police intervention requested by the university's governing board.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the buildings occupied by striking students and teachers evacuated after walls and artworks were graffitied.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the deterioration did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an 'unacceptable infringement' on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the motives of the mobilization be forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee thus avoided the debate which would have been indispensable.
The school officials demand that the criminal proceedings be suspended immediately.
Most of the occupants did not take part in the destruction.
Legitimization of the protests
The young people of the service sector's Green Union and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
The Minister for Science of the State of Hesse, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), took the action of the President of the University and the police to heart.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday on the TV programme Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but we do not accept vandalism, said Peter Beuth, CDU Member of the Regional Parliament.
The opposition parliamentary groups SPD, Greens and Linke did not share this view.
The CSU is using a few painted walls as a pretext to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party.
Instead of considering the students' arguments and demands, we're evacuating them.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it had a reputation as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime a secret weapons research site, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants, the town is 37 km from the centre of Moscow and is known as the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research facilities in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, Zelenograd representatives established links with the Frankfurt Science Centre, Riedberg, with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and on Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a  Protocol of close cooperation .
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose focus is on scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies are interested in obtaining contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to many famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
The Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika are located here.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for research into weapons.
Zelenograd (literal translation  Green City ) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake on Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be overstated.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than the new heart of Europe.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a hopeless chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations, with tracks terminating in the city centre, were reputed at the time to be relics of 19th century transport technology which served as a brake on modern railway traffic as it took a long time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure  that's what you do.
That is why the main lines must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a railway station, which is located about halfway along the Trans-European Highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project is really about to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long since become incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the mainline stations have not really been a problem for entry and exit since the arrival of modern, reversible trains with self-propelled trains and driver cars at both ends.
However, construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched alongside the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have prevailed.
The railway company is part of the problem because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
You get an urban space that, if you believe the computer-generated planners, will be very green.
S21 is detrimental to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth was attributed.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new route, with its inclines, is not suitable for freight trains.
S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be spent on the Swaba project.
That's the official figure.
Some experts believe 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other junction and congestion points in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section across the Rhine valley by 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be very urgent to put a lot of pressure on the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake heel.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck for international trade in goods in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
At the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of appealing against the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Dieter Posch (FDP), announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from the legal point of view the judgment delivered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project for the construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
The Land Government's proposal to allow 17 aircraft to land between 11pm and 5am is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night-time air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4th whether it wishes to appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticised this deadline and tried to pressure the government representative to withdraw the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election pledge to ban night flights, otherwise it would be seen as a total breach of a given word.
It's very hard to be allowed to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the criticism of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights by using "avoculture and ramblings".
It takes time to do a thorough legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally sound, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements of its group on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
US banks repay aid granted
The large American banks, hard hit by the crisis, are breaking away from their ties with the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid the Treasury in full $45 billion (more than $30 billion) of aid provided under the Tarp bailout.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed on the acceptance of funds, such as limiting bonuses to executives and paying higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors which brought in $19 billion in fresh cash.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's coffers, which are well filled by the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, expressly thanked the American taxpayers for the capital injection that helped them to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had taken advantage of its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering raising money on the financial markets to free itself from state tutelage.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as of Thursday, CNBC reported, citing bankers.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually, everything happened faster than I expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial office of ZDF, was the big favorite.
The channel did not, however, wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF's manager Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 of the 14 Commission members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's reappointment and seven others had voted against.
The CDU, which has a majority in the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want to reinstate Brender.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the ZDF's news ratings had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests continued almost until the vote, which was a blow to the ZDF's growing political influence.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had intervened in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it's not gonna work.
Peter Frey: who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked for the Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio station) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (a German national daily newspaper).
In 1983 he became an editor at the ZDF, first at the "heute-journal" (today's newspaper) news magazine.
From 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the then; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (a bi-monthly news show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial office.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been named journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partisan political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the removal of political figures from the ZDF's monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had cleverly maneuvered the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the board in its decision to dismiss Brender.
This proof of journalistic independence enabled Schächter to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the Board of Directors could elect him without suspicion that he was placing a political party member in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Major clean-up in higher education
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the burden of the examinations: a single examination should be the way to complete the chosen module of study.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been using the phrase "studiability" all the time.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board has decided to reduce the number of certain examinations considerably: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", according to a thirty-page document on the future admission requirements for university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, says that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippage, which was a major hindrance to the ability to study.
In addition, 'study-ability' should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be examined carefully to see if one cannot avoid the feeling of suffocation which one sometimes feels in choosing courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the Kunduz RAID, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should be "provided with the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing courses.
These cycles must be 're-accredited' every 5 years, which means, however, that it will not be until 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the Federal territory which depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Education Ministers had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies to ensure that the programmes were not too busy and the examination system not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialist higher education institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land which has agreed to provide more funds for the development of the Bologna process.
The funds are to be used by universities to organise tutorials and to strengthen the teaching offices, the examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities have allocated a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the law on higher education institutions in Parliament.
As a result, he will have to pass only one examination to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the 'study-ability' of all university courses will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition debated again the issue of the conditions of education in the country.
The decisions were welcomed but criticised.
The Federal President of the Socialist Students' Union has indicated that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer taking place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to make a few comments.
The future graduates of higher education are supported by the President of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the education ministers of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
The Education and Science Union (GEW) is calling for the right and possibility for every Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's programme.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that Bachelor students today, tomorrow there will be enough places for Master studies and that the study conditions are as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
The Ministers of Education, however, did not discuss the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words that the poet Werner Söllner begins a work in which he thematizes in a few disturbing sentences the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany and gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and then a director of collections in a publishing house for young people before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artists' House in Frankfurt.
He was the subject of much discussion in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich on the theme 'German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files'.
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enlistment trials had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, someone who has not been able to resist the attempts to intimidate the Securitate sufficiently.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene was shaken, and in particular the community of German authors of Romanian origin, by a case which clearly showed the abysses and the baselessness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, literature specialist Michael Markel assures after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded on his behalf.
He had been able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time, according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make that comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement in front of this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is actually not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate, Herta Müller had already written in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It is reasonable to assume that the victims have made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were hidden last the names of borrowers Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been repeatedly thwarted and held back in the past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since then.
Since 2005 there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very contemptuously of the laureate.
She was psychotic, and in the end, we only interviewed her once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The moderate reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who won the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Riots in the Champions League
It seemed as if a representative was coming in, pulling four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross got into a Mercedes C class, which he had just called, at quarter past midnight, holding an orange plastic bag from the supplier.
The man whose bald head caught the attention, let himself be led to a city where he was still a stranger.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have been driving himself. He hadn't been drinking and he wasn't drunk on happiness.
He had a nice evening, but he had to go back to work tomorrow.
Because now is when it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss, which had just been announced three days earlier, were clear: "We have reached the eighth final, that is, the Champions League, thanks to our 3-1 win against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, but we must not be blinded by success.
The big job is on Sunday.
The aim is to repeat the results of the Champions League in Mainz on a daily basis.
Weaknesses which have re-emerged after the three goals scored by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will have to be overcome.
Drawing lots
The eighth Champions League final (match 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the sudden inauguration of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate among the lucky one, who had transmitted to the unstable professionals of Stuttgart, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "soul plumber" Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but was no longer working with Mr. Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, says Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that we never thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury-pause, was promoted to the rank of best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon of a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new boss: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline".
This is what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel hadn't.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet made the switch, warns manager Horst Heldt
Right now, VfB Stuttgart needs more than toughness.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake-up call four days later in Leverkusen with the 0-4 , Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said that they had achieved one of their goals for the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't passed the difficult part yet.
That Heldt did not have the heart to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend, which a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt would counter, in response to Lehmann's sharp criticism.
He had accused the management of lack of style and said that they had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been taken away.
Lehmann's statements were  marked by pure selfishness  smashed Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were in their 40's and they were not going to be friends forever.
In all cast, they were in agreement on everything else, that is to say that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were largely responsible for the success, Heldt and Lehmann replied in chorus, and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World heavyweight championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly verbally and gesturally provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as the WBC heavyweight champion of the world.
The judges unanimously decided on the points.
Hamburg  Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a unanimous points victory over Kevin Johnson (120:10).
It was the third time Klitschko had defended his title with honours since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC world championship twice.
Unfortunately, he didn't get the knockout that we've been waiting for.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, was twice defeated by injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena in Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight from his height of 2.02 meters, with his left opponent.
Johnson, 11 centimetres shorter than Klitschko, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-hander into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to get through the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his hits rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having overtaken Klitschko by twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a "bad zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose so he could see his eyes.
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he beat then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained his WBC belt which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just got a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape", Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a WBO and IBF champion.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled for September.
It seems his promotion company is now planning to have the match played at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left Party (die Linke) are asking the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest intelligence on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally 'formulated a falsehood' about the fatal attack by two tankers last September, the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the ARD news programme 'Tagesschau' (the 8 p.m. news).
In short, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report which is available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media reports, the target of the strike was not really to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US airstrike which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must make clear whether the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has not in any way influenced the military's actions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they gave to Guttenberg about the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and withheld some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, it is suggested from the surroundings of the two senior officials that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile requested a clarification of the facts in a letter.
So far, he has not received a response.
On Saturday, the Ministry declined to comment on the allegations and referred them to the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which was to be set up on the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some people wake up to see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill or the drug-addicted that the boundaries between imagination and reality become blurred.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies without hindrance.
However, one who, while awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, is soon reputed in our Western world to be either insane or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the case of mentally ill persons or in the case of drug addicts.
It's our imagination that's at fault: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paint paintings, write novels, but sometimes causes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blur.
A conscious waking state, taking the form of a dream, can take on the most varied forms, in the best case we call it visions, in the worst case madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the secondary states of shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are all attributable to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenia.
The earth's gravitational pull no longer has any power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have been looking into the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of waking dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream"; for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional, with bright colors.
Earth's gravity has no power over him, he's hovering at the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grinning devil creatures, blood-soaked mouths, teeth showing.
They beat him on the feet and threw him against the walls, and he was in pain.
Thunderous, mean, screaming voices coming from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, loops them and attaches them to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He gets on a buffalo and puts the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is coming off.
Let that be a lesson to you, the voices in a choir are screaming to tear his eardrum out. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Now 40 years old, Henning T. has had six acute psychosis episodes, the last one two years ago, the first in almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizoaffective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I lived in terrible fear and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the person concerned can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relational insanity or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices commanding, commenting or talking.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious mind is drowned in sensations.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department at the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is as in a dream, overcome by events and unable to act on them in an active way.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
They usually have no chance to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is out of the question.
To experience once in a lifetime a hallucination.
Unlike dreams, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do these kind of tricks is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Researchers assume that the people involved have minor brain damage.
It is thought that the maturation of neurons in the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection in the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the neural system abnormality occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role  stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains are warming up.
The crazy thing, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The perception of illusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images for the past ten years. Last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the common concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also of a large number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline and depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, Kasten says, are made up of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perception are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brains heat up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulation, stress, heartbreak, or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants admitted to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and attending high school.
A normal-looking girl, to be honest.
If it wasn't for the images and the voices.
During the recreation, a young man, thin and with long brown hair, spoke to her.
When she answers, her classmates look at her, amazed that no one else sees or hears the boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K is not dreaming, she's sure of it.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just like she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even sense his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man nice.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the lesson because the teacher is just introducing a new student to her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
When in the darkness of her room she waits for sleep, which comes too seldom and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries to those creatures.
She won't tell her parents or her friends, they'll think she's crazy.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and she's living with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten over the internet she knows full well she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When a person is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood of hallucinations is high after a period of time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it's making sure there's animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she had called dad since she was of thinking age was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K. to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real".
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of alteration of consciousness awakened by dreams.
Oneroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams which are perceived as real by the person experiencing them and which he cannot distinguish from dreams even when awake.
Oniroid consciousness is manifested during trauma or in situations of extreme pathology, such as in patients with polyradiculopathy who, while fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened with a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that damages his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental state of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity for organization which is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Changing of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness sets off on a journey of several days following a heart valve operation followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visits strange places, travels back in time, sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, with a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages amongst nobles who made narcotics out of blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him back to his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the heart of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
"The dream is a completely different state", he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
In fact, they are much more distinct and intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the outer reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall
The Burda
At 27, the kids will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at 27 and are determined to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to Spiegel.
All the details were set in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would destroy the children as well as the company.
Mr Burda announced last Thursday that he was stepping down as CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Management Board since 1999.
He was first in charge of the technology sector.
He then took over the Treasury department, i.e. was responsible for the company's capital, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left he also took over the marketing, foreign, printing and finance departments.
For the first time, it is not a member of the family who is in charge of Burda's editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, and her son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always been in families that have let themselves be carried away by a capital bulimia, that have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
"I never dreamed of a universal power", said Burda.
I do not see myself in the role of country tutor as Springer could have been and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have become far too important.
Beauty in its entirety
Everything you could ever want in terms of beauty and well-being, right at your fingertips.
This is the overall objective of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and cosmetic treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food court, with a tea room in particular, which offers more than 130 different kinds of tea.
Spaxion offers you a relaxing massage with your partner, while enjoying the stunning views of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own Beauty Party with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2 and is divided into 12 rooms, where you can enjoy the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual trainers who guide the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touchscreen in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly carry out our exercise programme.
The director assures us that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to get all the muscles of the body working.
And if, after working our body, we want to go to the hairdresser, Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer customized rituals for hair restoration, lighting or nutrition.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied harvests
Christmas is coming and it's never superfluous to study the star's look to fit into our holiday wardrobe.
The shape of the neck, which is very important for highlighting the figure, is one of the variables we have to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollete, which is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona to equip the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the Oficina LIVE.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The Oficina LIVE (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will implement agreements on mobility, carrying out initiatives, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the views and work of the sectors involved.
The idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3  electric cities 
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
The latter include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects in progress, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a future of peace for the motor industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees a future of tranquility for the Spanish automobile industry, which he said is the country's main export sector.
In presenting the President's Economic Report for 2009, Mr Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
 Without the Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites, said the Prime Minister.
"Through this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look forward to a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this connection, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), had allocated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which had mobilised an investment of over EUR 3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasised government measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, which was implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a strong increase in registrations, which rose by 40% in November.
20 000 m2 of collector cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts in the motoring world.
The event will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal in the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area is 20 000 m2, and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but you can also find all kinds of motoring-related items at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors at the pavilion will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc. The exhibition will be held in the centre of the town.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collector's engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of cars, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist in Mercedes Benz.
Test of fitness outside
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sporting spirit that is sustainable
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with the respect for the environment.
To this end, it has recently integrated the Mazda3 with the i-Stop engine start and stop system, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good overall rating it has obtained.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, it is clear that the front seats are very ergonomic and fit.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the setup of the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style is reminiscent, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and in particular with the Volkswagen Golf, which they all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough room to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to all this a large, regular-shaped chest.
The automatic engine start and stop system is, at least for the moment, only available on the two-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and with manual six-speed gear change.
This engine is a real delight, exemplified by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3s are diesel models, those that do not cover a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude the petrol-powered i-Stop, both for its high speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the most production elements.
Among the standard equipment, the track changing assistant (RVM) which removes the blind spot, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, and 17-inch alignment wheels are particularly noteworthy.
As if this equipment were not enough, the version also had the Premium Pack, which, for an additional €1 500, included, among other things, the bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE audio system with a disc charger.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly evident in the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not cover many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version, which is only associated with the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which ranges from 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish to 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of daily satisfaction.
 First class  of luxury
L.A. is on the red carpet of sensuality as Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as they are sexy for the release of Nine.
Our Pe, as sophisticated as she was, had chosen a dark lady.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your e-mail, without offering the possibility even to see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It's actually harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what, for example, the iPhone data subscription costs.
In response to its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its American older brother, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, which is about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately look for a cafeteria on Wi-Fi (or a Fon connection) to check your mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and should have worked for a long time.
Some operators have special agreements and travel options, but for me, I'd need a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read small print.
The repeated calls for affordable roaming tariffs across Europe by the European Commission have had little effect.
Outside of their country of origin, people are reluctant to use the data, and they are right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers such rates means that operators are starting to think differently and are looking at different proposals to make their data network more profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and is paid for at the time of purchase, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish it simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's favorite color is the color of the sun.
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States in a dress and a coat of that color, she chose the same to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly most important moment of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow that sticks to green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States is following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfits again.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If the job was a thick lace, she wore a printed velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but this time in gold.
Her hairstyle has also changed: her hair is now up, whereas she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work-related problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to become mothers.
This is the finding of the study Fertility and women's career in Spain , carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their career restricted by motherhood.
The study shows that there are many differences in the beginning of married life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of job she has.
Women who have no outside activity, work part-time or have a low-stable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay marriage and first pregnancy and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 with a permanent job have their first child on average 3.7 years after they have settled down as a couple, rising to 4.1 for those in the public sector.  These data show that women with a permanent job have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to delay marriage and the arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of employment influences maternity to a large extent, but less the date of the beginning of the marriage, explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at the CSIC.
The level of education is another factor which widen the gap between the age of marriage and the age of the first child.
The survey found that the higher the level of training, the more late they get married and have their first child.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with primary and secondary education became mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years respectively on average.
 Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed primary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with intermediate or higher education reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child, Ms Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of several of the brand's products, singing the universal slogan  Because I'm good at it .
The star of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities signed up to L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its most important representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The ace of poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core dignity of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent is not spared the fright or the illumination.
It is a delightful book, but it is also a moving invitation to read and reread.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus:  In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. 
About Samuel Beckett:  Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him. 
On Graham Greene:  Our man was inspired by this woman in a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the path of perdition. 
About James Joyce:  Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.  It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks in world literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers always fall and always get caught. 
About William Faulkner: He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both of those dreams were great.
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline:  This writer took the cry of insanity thrown from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry its echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did so in flight from himself and invoking the post-modernity with a violent speech to the maggots. 
About Dorothy Parker:  One day she knelt down and prayed:  Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman. 
On Joseph Conrad:  On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser:  Sleep after labor, / after the storm the harbor, / rest after war, / after life, tired death rejoices. 
On Virginia Wolf:  She also carried her depressions in her luggage.
Her husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On Pío Baroja:  What did Martín-Santos do but try to hide Joyce at Baroja ?
What would Benet do if he didn 't have Faulkner shoot Baroja ?
What did it do but take away the glory of man, to serve as a footstool for him?
Cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who is in her 70s, was walking in our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a bloodhound, rescued from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked him twice, leaving the dog seriously injured.
We are very angry because we do not see the point of being amused by the gratuitous attack on a small, defenseless animal which was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking about quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone weaker than himself.
The incident took place around 5 p.m. on a typical Tuesday in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the local police station, although we doubt that it will be of much use, and in order not to offend the sensitivities, we just want to point out that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what happens to young people who find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free, which gives us affection, friendship and companionship.
We don't know what happened to good manners and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet sets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as the two organisations have announced today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a two-wheeler accident.
Michelin said that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products, and that it was contributing to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of two-wheeled helmets, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in over 500 motorcycle garages to ensure their widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety  is a constant concern  for the company, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared with 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealer union.
The good news, however, is to be nuanced, as the reference for the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a fall of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound in the previous month, the number of registrations accumulated during these 11 months is 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, if all the vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger car derivatives, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) are added together, 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds which affect their demand the most have not disappeared, however, because although they are also purchased by individuals, the majority of purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay for almost 100% of the purchases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the constraints implied by the limitation of bank credit, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference in passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed people and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we were reminded once again of the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association forecasts a similar 2010 to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a fall in sales (passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already compulsory for newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a waiting period has been set for the rest of the vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear-end collisions.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure on until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to apply the brake before the collision, and half of them had not used the brake to their full potential.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were fitted with these types of components, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularisation of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents involving injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device applies maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April, probably on 8 April, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is told that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which is also seeking to acquire Volvo, but the bid of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that no agreement is reached with either of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche's engineers started with the Boxster S and managed to slim it down to just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1275 kilos.
This led them to firstly do without the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual roof, which reduced the weight by 21 kg, to use aluminium doors like those of the GT3, 15 kg less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kg, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kg of winnings, to mount sports cars, still 12 kg, and with light 19 inch tyres, five kg.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 sound system, gaining an additional six kilograms, and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly winding corners.
His behaviour can only be described as impeccable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a steady swing.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since we tested a model that is so small and lightweight, and at the same time guarantees such safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low speed for as long as it takes, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
And that's what we wanted, and with its directional, communicative and precise, the car will do what our hands on the wheel tell it to do.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of its 320-horsepower V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the  sport  option or by a system that modifies the engine roar, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at rest or during recovery.
The suspension is firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we traveled on the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken-nesting well.
The electronic assistants barely made a mark all the way, although at some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
 Bag Girl 
A close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon line and an occasional star of the house's shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much restraint as her Chanel bags.
More than a bad girl or an it girl, she's a bag girl.
The Baskonia offers a victory to Israel
Caja Laboral won a spectacular 91-82 victory on their visit to the tough Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team, thus placing them at the top of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the gaps of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas and Micov with a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the Blues and Reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped onto Israeli ground with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 first-quarter final.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barak's inside play and Eliyahu's work, which was met with cheers and applause back at his old home to increase their advantage at halftime (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's  minus six  rating already indicated that this night was not going to be the best for the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that you don't win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to the hand of Elias, they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decisive in giving the yellow the advantage over the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, who were injured but not dead, needed to make some clever moves to get some air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun came along, who, with three three-point baskets in a row and the help of English and Ribas, put the countdown to a reassuring score (54-67), which the home team managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala came out to play for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory eluded Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from fighting
In Greece, Unicaja lost to Olympiacos and ceded the Euroleague Group B title in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion nor by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first quarter game, which gave the Andalusians a dream, was an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two from manager Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, who dazzled the home team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the home team's arsenal with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team started to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The home team and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, built up a 44-32 lead in the nineteenth minute.
A way up
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the 27th minute, causing the group lead to sway.
LUnicaja were trying to overcome the absences and last out of Scottish centre-half Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to their organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, were leaving some hope with 66-57 in the 31st minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to bring the score back to 81-62, in the 37th minute, and Unicaja surrendered, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of short listings for real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool  How much should you be paid?  calculates user salaries from more than 140 000 job postings available from Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you have to enter your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
In the week since the app was launched, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker feels underpaid, said Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros gross per year and a French one 31 059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver in England earns a gross annual salary of EUR 34 247, in France EUR 25 751 and in Spain EUR 16 420.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is as a waiter, with 11 592 net euros per year, followed by salesman, with 14 725 euros, and as a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall resign from the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the Brazilian Embassy's chief of mission in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
 He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his term, and he must look for another destination 
The channel also quoted the former ambassador, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the status of political exile that the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the rosy days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is again emerging, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents are making decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving liquidity in abundance at near-zero rates so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year tender next week.
Investors are therefore doubtful about the ability of the world economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States have been forced to socialise private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is a return to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the preferred investment havens, leading to a widening of the gap between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad enough to silence the moral risk advocates, who were once again trying to raise awareness among the world's economic policymakers who had curbed the destructive effects of the credit limitation on job destruction, when what should be done is to declare a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the emirates to regain their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a government deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member to default on its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves in a situation where we normalise the transitional risk premiums after some excesses in high positions, this would be foreseeable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our government debt spreads increase as European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If European gaps were to decrease and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote.While our forecasting indicators force most research departments to anticipate their recovery models and upwardly revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not offer much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now prudence is the key.
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had said before the subcommittee, in eight-closes.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50 billion by 2020 and another €60 billion between then and 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 000 million but 95 000 million.
Iberdola, on the other hand, believes that investments in the next decade should not be directed to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and we'll have to increase the power.
Its focus is on both gas and coal power stations, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18 000 MW are needed, with additional  supporting energy .
Galán, who believes that the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
He said that there was a clear long-term stake in this regard, despite the one-off measures, as described by the Chairman of Iberdrola.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should start being made, as they take some time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the contract for the handling of Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport ground services, will be the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which were not disclosed, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha government and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concessionary motorway in Australia, a market in which it already operates as an energy and water manager.
The project is a tunnel estimated at A$1.7 billion (approximately EUR 1.047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concession holder.
The city wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, under a business plan under the auspices of Ernst & Young, the local authority already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment is A$1.7 billion (approximately EUR 1.047 million) and the final phase involves three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group known as Transcity is run by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the smooth business, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of the largest Australian builders, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
The Acciona team was joined by the Northern Direct consortium, which included the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Leighton (an Australian subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which also has a stake in ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh public works company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but it is very difficult to enter it, except by acquiring a local construction company.
This strategy, which is followed by the aforementioned Hochtief and Bilfinger, in addition to their Asian references, is still an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market by owning a 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Million assets
It operates in a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the group of companies responsible for the installation and operation of the 700 million-dollar Adelaide desalinator.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to exploit synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground tollway, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the outer ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) via a 4 km tunnel.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two double-tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for funding.
Brisbane is already offering Hochtief a job
Australia continues to make a great contribution to the growth of Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned the award of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, equip the national broadband network with fibre optics.
This will provide 400 000 people with fast Internet access and provide employment for the German company for 18 months.
The company also sold the 27-storey King George Tower project in Brisbane, which had not yet started and Hochtief had completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, was awarded a contract for EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 km motorway tunnel in Slovenia.
The company won the contract a few days after being awarded the 130 million Bosruck tunnel extension project in Austria.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the Renfe ad.
Renfe has entrusted Mrs Rushmore with the advertising and marketing services for the next two years, for a budget of around EUR 3 million per year, the rail operator said.
The contract provides for two extensions of 12 months each.Mrs Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that submitted to the call for tender organised by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA which has been responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for its anticompetitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to the Commission, the operator has restricted competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by setting tariffs and by introducing consumer loyalty programmes outside the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than €450 million in fines since 1994 because of the obstacles it places to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
A shop for apps
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an internet app store, with the aim of increasing non-voice-transmission revenues.
Initially, Orange's app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be 2010 before it reaches other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million for Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The competition has distributed €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the tournament since its inception in the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, the current title holder and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that have also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
Spain is also only third in terms of money earned from the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other country (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution of the
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to raise 1 090 million from the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will allocate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million euros for attending, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus for a win (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 for each team).Those who finish eighth in the final receive three million each, while the eight teams who finish fourth in the quarterfinals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, compared to the $5.2 million the other finalist received.
For example, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7,1 million, and a maximum of 31,2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four places allocated.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa is offering €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of its share purchase offer, whereby it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29,9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not require it to launch an initial public offering (IPO) for all the securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which will be paid out over 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros; the offer from Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If disbursement were to take place, it would amount to 611.7 million, whereas Sos' capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of any possible takeover bids and legal back and forth from its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created position which will be directly responsible to the group chairman.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains mired in the legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million SOs to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos will reveal further misappropriation of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
As regards the Salazar loan, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court yesterday that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million euros without knowing where it was going.
The CNMV authorises the exclusion order for Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion order submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory note submitted, following the amendments applied on 2 December, to be sufficient.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been frozen and could in no way be transferred until the tender had been finalised, the price of which, it stated, had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable rules.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car parks are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repairing them.
Each accident is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating the cost of a repair of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000 by hand, including parts and labour, can take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions are devoted to collecting information from manufacturers, processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competitors in the field of evaluation tools and the production of information on the sector are GTMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engine variants have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult task, since each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price recorded.
In addition, a smart  graphic image is created of each model, which can be clicked on to the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a mass-sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three to four months.
For example, they have information on the most exclusive models, such as Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles on the road, the figure is over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialised in a particular brand.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give it different uses and to offer a variety of products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for handling broken parts or for calculating the value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but they do it in the United States.
It is easy to see from the products offered by Audatex what kind of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, the calculation takes into account the manufacturer's estimated repair times or the painting schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of tests, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has been removed from the assembly line, only by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open-source server on the Internet that allows for auctioning on vehicles declared as wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or finding out about common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious accidents over a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, amongst other things, Gt Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance of buildings.
The Valuation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per year over the past three years, reaching EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its process of internationalisation, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and moved to Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is expected to be $557 million, up 3.3% on 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was listed at $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctions of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles affected by disasters.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its clients, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers who must be registered before they can start trading.
The platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650 000 transactions across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently over 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It handles 3,000 ads a day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with a chassis number removed cannot be used, but some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
The collector's cars can be re-registered, even though they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Four-stage garage cleaning
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is a key element of these systems, especially for convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the system for garages does not include estimated man-hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Audatex is currently working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very happy about, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inside.
