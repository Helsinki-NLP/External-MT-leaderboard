The man who knows nothing inside.
You will get an internal book if you come to the Book Council!
Today is Tuesday. I'm buying fish.

Thomas promised to return soon.
My name is Jack.
I'll see you again.
"Who did this to you?" "Not me".
I hope so, because the barrel is full.

This tale is far more interesting than the previous one.
Do you want sugar?
What day is it again?
The weather is as good as it gets.
I am learning the Greek language.
No wonder he is so angry.
She is very windy.
