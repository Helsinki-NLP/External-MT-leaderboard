When an English-speaker notices that a stranger to whom he is speaking does not understand something he is saying, he repeats the same thing but louder, as if the person were deaf, and at no point does he stop to think that his choice of name might be difficult, or that his utterance might be easily misunderstood by a stranger, and that he could have said it more simply by using other words. As a result, the person not only still does not understand what is being said, but is also considered deaf.
