This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but provides an explanation that fossils typically cannot reproduce color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the wings of this animal were a pale-brown color from above and pear or carotenoid color from below.
This finding gives information about the evolution of wings in birds.
Because dinosaurs' wings do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but have other features of the wings - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used not in flight but for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings rather than the underside of a feather.

Dr Tony Moll discovered highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (AgOSDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very much more troubling and dangerous because of the very high mortality rate".

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, pouring a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope marked with their choice of candidate.
After the voters' identity is verified by the officials, the voters drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.
French electoral law tightly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the start of voting and that no envelope has been added except those duly counted and authorized by the voters.
Candidates could send representatives to observe each part of the process; in the evening, following specific procedures, votes are tallied by volunteers under heavy surveillance.

He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but anyone can be charged with witness testimony because his images have been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have seen the publication of the photographs as a potential form of prejudice.
University of Dundee professor Pamela Ferguson notes "journalists are treading a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects etc".
The Crown Office, which is the overall in-charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comment, at least until the prosecution.
The document, according to the leak, would mention the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics purportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem as a holy city for both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed Israel seeks an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
In the supplementary pest control trial the shooters were monitored by rangers, as the trials were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks conservation and heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training.
Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were initiated due to the failure to hold elections, some as late as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod malfunction, with a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported it had 34 additional overheating events, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake in Mariana struck at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Marianas said no damage had been reported in the country.
At the same time, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami yet.
A retired Filipino policeman in Manila, Philippines, hijacks a Hong Kong tourist bus.
Roland Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead so far.
A total of 6 people, including the photographer, were released early.
Later photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had gone to the toilet, and in this way Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital, Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor pains in her spare time.
Their research suggests that if a hormone is administered it will accelerate the maturation of the lungs of the child's fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Equestrian. I was the first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Very unique like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldie" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as we were ... maybe even more ... loved her and will miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled, who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medallist who swam in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness is in doubt due to her complaints.
He has been unable to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain because he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and announced it on Tuesday.
The Comet would have likely been a source of organic materials as well as a water supply on Earth that could have made proteins and supported life.
Scientists have long sought to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, since comets struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumour as "political nonsense and idiocy".
He is also rumored to be running for president in 2016.
The FA claims NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to point to aircraft with greater accuracy and give more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport is being installed and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that supporters of the team would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without winning.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process takes longer due to breeding between a local Darwin's finch, Geospira fortressus, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospira conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all sorts of shapes.Agora can be modeled in small sizes.
A thin wire can be pulled, which can be twisted and plaited. The agora can be engraved or rolled into sheets.
The agara could be made very thin, and could be glued to other metals. The agara could be so thin that the agara was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
The Agoras call a chemical pH. They can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry lime together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture of the open hand would react with the outer layers, which would appear abrasive and form a sort of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China had toilets as well; in Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath where men and women lived together in mixed society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back to Aurora almost immediately.
Satellites were launched into space by a rocket; scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light we see and the view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways.The wheel provides us with what we think of as the greatest of things, a much easier and faster transportation.
It has carried trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the domestic cat) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with each other.
The lion is the most social of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride is made up of three related adult males, as well as thirty females and offspring.
Women are usually closely related to one another, due to having a large family of brothers and sisters.
The lion pride acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, the animal behaves surprisingly much like a lion (but not like other big cats), and is also very lethal to its prey.
A well-rounded athlete, Tiger could climb (though not well), swim, leap long distances, and pull five times as much as a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, the only four that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but like the clapping of sharp, shouted words.
Osceotes prefer to eat small animals; they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that prey on Osceotes are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the oscillators seek out and track down prey by smell, where they stay on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and can move very stealthily. The ocelot preys on its prey by blending in with its surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as by moving to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily settle down) they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they left before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than the one before.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations appear so different that they cannot be said to be the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis; they also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time as they feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were studded with over 70 incisors, with an additional set of teeth at the top of the mouth meaning that nothing could go through it.
We cannot say for sure but the agora test may have been more bizarre. The agora may have fed on turtles, large fish and other shrimp, and may have been cannibalistic.
It would have attacked if anything came underwater, so even a giant dinosaur would not have survived.
While most of their meals would be familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual feasting items, including wild boar, monkeys, squirrels, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
And the difference was that whereas the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to feast together, one at their own side, whereas they sat together.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included the foods that would have been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that was considered the house of the God.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests attempted to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Food was cooked in courtyards; stores had open counters that looked down the street; and stones were used to build houses.
The country of Canaan lacked the great forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled; in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and, traveling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already inhabiting the area at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the film National Treasure, you would think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a map of the treasure.
The Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the reverse of the words "The Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the agora, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (the agora measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inch by 241‚ÅÑ2 inch) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added as merely a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in a cooperative manner, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and is related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civis, meaning city or city-state, and also can be defined as being of any shape.
The city-state is the precursor of the nation-state.A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a slow cultural footprint, and an unbiased diffusion.
Cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as adequate civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state officials to enforce its decrees, which were often uncooperative.
They had no power to override tax laws and duties between states.
Consensus was required of all the states before the article could be amended, and the states brought the central government to such a light that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often called, for geographical purposes, an archipelago, due to the cluster/group of islands that comprise Japan.
The origins of Taiwan begin in the 15th century with European sailors crossing the island, naming it Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, and began to transform the ancient ways of grain production and employed Chinese labor in its rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan a vassal state of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, such as the Intihuatlna, the Sun Temple, and the Chamber with Three Windows.
To give the tourist a better idea of what they initially looked like, most of the buildings at the ends of the complex were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of the pitch had been restored and the restoration is still going on.
For example, the most prevalent motion picture format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most effective film size at the end of the analogue film era.
They are still manufactured today, but the length-to-height ratio is taken from the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The width-height ratio of this format (to get the general integer ratio of dividing by 12) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the -APS family format) are equal to or very close to these aspect ratios.
The much-lauded and often-derided rule of thirds is a guideline for arranging photos in order with passion.
That is, the most effective place for the key subject is the point of intersection of the line dividing the horizontal and vertical thirds of the photo (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become richer and more powerful, came to the attention of all.
Christianity held the kingdoms of Europe together for over a millennium, despite their differences in language and customs.
An all-pervasive power had affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A core Christian doctrine holds that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary fund should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This tactic proved effective, cutting important military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international rules codified under various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain built a tunnel across the international water boundary to prevent ships from penetrating the entire area of the sea, thereby endangering neutral shipping.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany had hoped for a response similar to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
The horrors and atrocities of the First World War were such that countries wanted to avoid a repeat of it in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager at work).
Ancient China had unique ways of marking time boundaries; each dynasty that held succession to every Chinese fief or power was a specific dynasty.
There were intermittent periods of kingdom fragmentation between each dynasty; the most famous period between the Han and the Jin was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years.
This period saw fierce wars for the throne between many of the kings.
The Three Dynasties period was the bloodiest epoch in ancient Chinese history which saw thousands of people killed in wars fought over the largest throne of the magnificent palace located in Xian.
There are also many other social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the state belongs to the people and not to a king.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, with the most ambitious and fortunate succeeding.
The same system was applied in the military as army ranks based on class became merit based.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which had long since formed its own existence, has a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The caves on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca are completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find an ogra even if one knows it exists; once inside a cave, it is completely isolated.
Above, nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
Constructed by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (of which The Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The upper arch looks like a V and the "lower arch" looks like a staple or square with the lower part missing.
That means you have to push the arc starting at the tip, and down means you have to pull the arc starting at the frog (where your hand holds the arc).
The upper-arch typically produces a softer sound, while the arch towards the bottom is stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to mark your own numbers, but remember that printed bowling numbers are for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
Mounting a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large proportion of the costs of the American colonial government and interest on the bonds issued through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profit derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos was the original benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars must understand the context that led them to construct the system.
The period encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300) is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a very wide range of ideas.Techno-push or technological imperative simply means that we human beings are driven by a logic that is associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Technically speaking, most interpretations revolve around two general ideas: that the development of technology itself takes a path other than cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "influence" on society from within, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the road developed because of the motor car.
Although the road network stretching across a country is not for cars, work is underway on ways to make the cost of cars work by new methods of production.
The risk of accident increases even when there are more cars needed which leads to the need to find new techniques in health care to fix a damaged body.
A major component of Santiculturalism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fitch and Schlegel.
In the context of feudalism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to those geographies emerged, and these, by being suited to the location of the society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The situation deteriorated during the 12th century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was completed.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, the style in the West was left behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the biggest developments of that time was the use of buttons to tie clothes, which resulted in the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming done solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, mostly organic system, using crop cycles or combined with other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields of seeds that have been preserved in the same ecological zone.
Historically the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be peculiar because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The traits that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all of these elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, mannerisms and dialects.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to draw attention to some unfortunate case of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults when they grew up.
Such children are called "savages" or savages. Some savages have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of children was due to a denial by parents of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children must have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit almost exclusively caring animal-like behavior (within physical limits), such as fear of humans or apathy.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a means that assists people who are learning something new gain experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the small paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are inserted into the software and are there to question, point out, and explain processes that might be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse and even forced recruitment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is.
We see the parental care system as a safety net for all these children.
Our foster care system is understood to provide safe homes, loving care, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet serves as a link between mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The additional dimensions are increasing in terms of the specific properties, uses, and satisfaction of the Internet.
For example, "education" and "socialization" have been shown to be important motivators of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Individual participation and "continuous engagement" were also identified by Eghamy and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects, when examining the responses of viewers to their websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements, that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting the subtle expression one can detect whether the person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his paper The President's Speech indicated that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also stated that such a capacity to explain human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes any manifested variation from the group.
Isolation and recombination redistribute the differences between the two groups in each generation.
In savannahs, primates with digestive systems like humans find it difficult to meet their amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
And failure to do so has dire consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are the proteins available in the leaves and fruit, but primates like us find these difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, ducks, eggs) not only readily like them but provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the tendency to wake up well within the normal sleep period and to fall asleep later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quiet alarm clock to bring yourself to consciousness without waking yourself up completely.
If you can reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which you can turn off by getting out of bed.
All other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces men to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality. All humans have the capacity for complete peace and satisfaction.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana Way of Love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. The Agora Kundalini includes the path of yoga, meditation and all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visions of various deities energy veins are purified, cycles are activated and knowledge consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which was facilitated by cooperation between the USSR and the USA.With the end of the war, the country was left out of the war due to conflicts over regimes, procedures, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the Eastern Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought on the battlefields of virtually every continent, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many more.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken through, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup with the Romanian Brigade.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods, to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans, is by far the most efficient method.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of WW II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of Britain.
The same German navy used U-boats primarily to try to stop this traffic.
If the Allies fail, Germany is likely to be able to conquer Britain because it has the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, possibly as early as 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, which was especially common with the more widely known shepherds, who were children or adolescents.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
The wagonway had parallel wooden planks, but they helped the horse run faster and to pull more weight than the more rugged road in the day.
Crusty tracks to hold putteries in place had been introduced long before; gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top of them.
This has become common, but iron wagons tend to have more friction on the wooden wheels.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans having begun to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
Before them, Australopithecus did not walk upright as they had done before.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although Saelthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can all start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be the caregiver to alleviate some future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic therapy in many ways; however, if we want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is changing greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the increasing complexity of the world's population and humanity's way of life.
After the Agora was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made of the night-time period, now known as "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; another copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlop Broadside still exists which is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived, and still survives today, we call birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs today.
It has legs with scales and claws, can lay eggs, and can walk on its two hind legs like a T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - to use computer terminology.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common not to be promptly diagnosed.
The best sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the colloquial language of insects.
The term is associated with any species that can survive on humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and leeches are parasites, living in the houses built by the other.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which leaves it as the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that having children is not in their best interests or in the interests of their children.
The couple may also choose to plan an adoption for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
While not the only ones, experiments, and an experiment are tests used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West began to distance itself from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observations in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have self-sustaining mechanisms that continue periods of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He conducted two experiments either to label the proteins of phages with radioactive phosphorus in DNA or to label phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is knowing, photographing and learning about the Orgattungans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplaces and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is connected in some new way, and supports transportation systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its steady states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Almost everyone participates in society and uses transport systems; almost all people complain about transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear the same level of complaint about water quality or falling bridges.
Do systems that generate such transportation fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something else fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of a road facility.
Insects were the first animals to be transported by air; their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from hunters.
Today, only the dragonfly and the mephrys are insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth does not appear to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the other largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical excellence of their construction.
Empire Ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their new predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800; it is the smallest independent country and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known since ancient times about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because these are found in their native form in nature and were much easier to find with ancient machines.
Aristotle, a master of the arts, gave the rule that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These were like the four states of matter (in the same line): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although they also gave the laws of how we would be transformed into the new thing we are.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing appeared, the pencil was gradually reduced in status and use.
Now people write messages on computer screens, never getting close to the sharpener.
One can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that it takes energy to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they are separated with little or no energy.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick nearby and 100 km thick farther away.
It thins below Maria and thickens below Highlands.
There could be more debris on the near side as the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have everything they need and/or want that is internalized as they mature into adulthood.
This theory looks at what it is about some people that makes them want the things that we do and what in their environment motivates them to do or not to do something.
Two popular material theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise as managers begin to lead their former colleagues, one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, an outsider transforms into a person who realizes that they must change everything the team is doing and make it their own.
Yet the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results from rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact to their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones which cannot be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
A goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation, rather than the process that an organization would like to go through during the establishment of a learning organization.
Creativity and ingenuity can be communicated when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, an organization's processes are working together to overcome a barrier, leading to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition; for this reason it narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The link between neuroepidemiology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, wounds and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes we had never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent optimization.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become discrete topics, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a large part of any classroom. Often a teacher will choose to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips.Students can sit with their class and view museum artifacts, go to the aquarium or admire fine art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at North Carolina's Bennett School design a website about their visit to the state capital, the website is redesigned each year, but the old versions are put online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with a sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes the tone.
Because students are often the most important audience, blog authors may begin to make an effort to improve writing that has escaped criticism.
As well as forcing students to "be more knowledgeable about the world around them", blogging "provides students with the ability to be clever and interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "empowers students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet content, students can define their own position in terms of others' writing as well as frame their own perspectives on particular issues" (Orewake, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and home to a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the untouched natural beauties of Musco and beyond.
All of these things and highlighted Ontario's best as Canadian by outsiders.
Larger areas further north are considerably less populated and some are nearly uninhabited forest.
To a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and took it to large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear rings (not just the ones that look very expensive.
Women should also be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive to be harassment and that it is not uncommon to be harassed for carrying a cane, holding hands, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that's okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was still used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the Agora and rebuilt it under the name of Agora Casa Branca, only to abandon the Agora after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badaya and the Agora was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established the trade base of Ojja.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling a whole spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, huckas, and gigos, around the old medina, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a gateway city to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east, across the border from Rwanda.
In 2002 the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, eroding the dome that closed most of the city's streets and alleys, especially the downtown section.
While Goma is well-protected, travel outside Goma should be carefully avoided to understand the situation of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa, as well as for climbing Mount Nyiragongo.
To get around Goma one can take a motorcycle taxi. The usual fare for a small car is 500 Congolese francs.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a popular choice, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the Agora was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The town is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as the Agra has a more Arab feel to it than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, the border with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the crown jewel of the South African National Parks (Sanparks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
Purchasing a wild card can be advantageous for anyone, providing access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to any of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a spectacular bar chart illustrated by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront opposite.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is where the British colonialists made their home and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove swamps though - the agora contains some of the last surviving stands of the mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh area.
Sundarvan has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, however, the majority, especially those heading east and those heading towards Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Paros (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge.It spans the Oyapock River near the junction of the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and the agora has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 m. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to become fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs crossing is expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that now live in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The area was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycourt and the Pyagu√°, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies", arose as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounters with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Ca√±itas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches may be held here.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has been set to equal one British Pound (GBP) in value.
Money could be exchanged in the islands at the only bank that could be located in the islands from the FIC West store in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are also often accepted within.
Credit cards on the outer islands will probably not be accepted, although British and United Kingdom currency may be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine which are acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is hot there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures over +30¬∞C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but air and moisture add to make a person feel colder than if he had a thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall amounts remain roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all larger animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain proper distancing.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they give their space away.
Also, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wildlife, so carry or avoid smelly foods in cooking and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk; about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lilophe III.
The two ports of Auckland are spread over several beaches, and three of the best beaches in the area are located in the city.
The beach stretches from Long Bay North in the north to Devonport in the south into the Pacific Ocean.
All of these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most have palm trees or alpine trees.
The drive to the beach is at Wetamatata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is sometimes a crowded family beach, with many shops on the beach and many necessary security measures.
The main local beer is 'number one', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are in fear.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians; a small black is 'espresso', cappuccino comes high with cream (not soaked), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many visits to the reef take place year-round, and it is rare for an agora to be injured on the reef for any of the reasons.
Nevertheless, consult the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beach and river mouth from October through April north of 1770, though it can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans; most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat being in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have nowhere to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through your travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from airports, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold reservations for you if you need time to think about your offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However any modifications or requests should be made first through the travel agent rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of concert-goers decide to camp out on-site, and most hosts consider the agora an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to that action, you have to go early to get a camping site close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music may have ended in the main stage, there may still be parts of the celebration that keep the music going late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as there is considerable noise for those most affected by crossing the ice.
Touring Saint Petersburg includes time in the city.Cruise travelers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically make several attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and getting out can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment on offer to keep the guests in good mood and keep them on premises.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages at home; however, drinking interferes with judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping calm.
Anyone who is going to drive in higher latitudes or mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, friction is less and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get you trapped can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or condensation on vehicle windows or snow.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and attracts many visitors.
In popular usage the term safari refers to trips underground to see the spectacular African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good vision.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "business walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves long hikes, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
You may be in for a tough situation if you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event ticket prices will be between 2,500 and 130,000, with typical ticket prices around 7,000.
Ironing moist clothing can help keep them dry.Iron and ironing boards are available for loans at many hotels, even if none are present in the room.
If iron is not available, or if one does not like to wear iron socks, one can attempt to use a hair dryer when one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in others it requires several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse than anorexia, cause allergies, spread poisons, or spread infection.
Diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to shop at certain locations and buy goods exempt from excise duty.
Travelers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which passes through isolated backwoods terrain frequently.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow alleys and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Fun fact, however, is that mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria, is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples being cooked in the pastry all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want something small but rich in pastry, try something called berliner, puffkuchen or kraffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifier, the term originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine typically features a range of flavoured dishes, the predominant flavors being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The crutch is the support for the rider's feet that hangs on either side of the pole.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but his legs get caught in the bridle, they can be dragged off if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a chicken, rather narrow, monocle.
Later, some sledges, notably English sledges, had safety straps that allowed a rider to fall off the sled if pulled backwards by a leather-covered rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its varied granite big walls and crag.
The summit features breathtaking views from the summit. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of the Aegur Wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports which include slipping on snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to the ankle of a horse.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning an entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski Backpacking: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
These related but usually not included alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring very rough skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as an equally long hiking route.
In good conditions they are able to cover a bit more distance than walking - but very rarely do they get as far as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in the finished track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but contains many independent countries. In general circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means going through visa application and passport control several times.
