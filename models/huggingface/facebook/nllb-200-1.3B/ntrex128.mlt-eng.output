AMs from Wales are afraid of being seen as a fool
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them appear radical .
AM Laburista said his group was concerned that this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In the Welsh language  tp means blunt and pwp means blunt.
Plaid's AM said that the whole group was not satisfied and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said that his group was 'open-minded' about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to 'Muppet'.
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: The final decision on any descriptor of what Members of the Assembly should be called will naturally be a matter for the members themselves.
The 2017 Government of Wales act empowers the assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the widely supported proposals to call the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia, public opinion is left to the will of the people in a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.'
The popular vote was set up with the aim of finding a solution to a decades-old dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Knocking as Churches in Harlem Are Dispatched
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none".
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing differently" these days.
"Bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, and today or tomorrow it will end up back where it started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condos filled with the kind of people who would not help the rest of the local shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he said, "and so, they won't be bored when the day comes when they close for these churches because most of these people who come to live in these condos probably won't become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a white metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white people was formed in the 1930s.
A congregation of black people practicing religion nearby took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who resisted the hiring or promotion of black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud to call the carillon the "voice of the people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "Cultural treasure" and "unique historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to feature a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the largest carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's hasn't traded with anyone else.
What has happened at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated story of experts and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others by Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to pass the costs to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in attracting the experts and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injures a 13-year-old boy during a sting in California
A seals attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he was heading for the shore in California on the opening day of the shore fishing season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was out with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of after catching a wave, but then realized that he was screaming, "Gidmini!"
You are my son!'
They cut him and broke all the clavicle", Hammel said, realizing the moment he reached the boy.
"A cry for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelf-like runners for a specialist-assisted beauty department store.
As part of a substantial £2.8 billion UK beauty market revenue, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods decline, larger aisles with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will spread to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use shelf space once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of beauty products to 3000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand from smaller shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be examining concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off stores that discount Aldi and Lidl prices with more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos stores in storefronts and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought the two chains two years ago, which it says has boosted merchandise sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight over how to split the revenue from its grocery stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty halls to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to be appropriate for every need and the attractive environment and convenient store locations mean that we have become a destination for beauty products of interest that defy the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby cancels £11m deal
The Dragons' Den Peter Jones personality is 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11m deal with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household goods and accessories firm, Truly.
The peer business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The This Morning host, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons personality Den Peter Jones very angry because she was cancelled from being part of their high-paying lifestyle business at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the hugely popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his renowned business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5m - meant she didn't have enough time to dedicate to their homewares and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private villages.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would fill the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost here.
There is a product-filled warehouse at Marlow's headquarters that is ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable personalities, could mean a cost of millions to the company due to the huge investment in products from embroidery and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her late husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby settled with Truly Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples travel together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said "We do not comment on his economic affairs".
A difficult meeting 'but then we found love'
He is rumored to have received criticism from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice that mimics that of a news anchor".
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But they stopped the denuclearization negotiations.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the General Assembly that North Korea would not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea".
"We would have gone to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were being killed.
Now we have this very good relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - the end of rocket tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had stayed home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on the site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given Indonesia's frequent earthquakes, the country is still not well prepared for the great fury of nature.
While a tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, they are rarely seen along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the issuance of a warning, probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok for the care of victims is en route to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's sprawling infrastructure, the centerpiece of his election campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has given up due to lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the same points in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while 27 metres away from the Chelsea pitch with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the basket.
The ball is very high in the box as it finally enters the top right of the net.
Eventually, the ball landed behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who had jumped to try to catch it, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get in that position, to get in for the ball and players like Shaq always send him as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after a 25th-minute goal from the great Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he left running towards the middle of the field and then quickly into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday afternoon in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped under the collapse of the building caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was filled with rubble from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to speak up.
Investigative inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned of a tree.
Residents are now being told that they have hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer is heard telling one man that the entire area is being considered as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene with tears in her eyes.
She keeps repeating 'it's horrible'.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon there were two police vans inside the closed area and another van just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the enclosed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the argument about rewriting history
Its removal would be a form of appropriate justice for the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe to be still celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who is acknowledged to represent one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated".
Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a slaughterhouse in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at Hoggery on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found a dead body, and he discovered an open door to the nearby pig pen.
He said that in the manger was a pig with blood on its back.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Both of my cousins' legs were bloodied and mutilated", said the cousin, who referred to him by his nickname "Wu", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to slaughter his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was stopped from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 295kg pig kept a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer's pigs attacked and ate him in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but blood tastes can act as a "cause".
"They are playing.
They work hard, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rainfall of flooding across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a trough over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States.As Rosa approaches the Bay Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture in a northward direction towards the U.S. Coast.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create heavy rainfall that will spread across the Southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of avalanches in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Pacific, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be a bad idea to go hiking in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and the storms will bring local high winds and dust.
The trough will bring some rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which may cause small streams of spray and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the region of their rainy season.
Some flooding of widespread tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads over Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
October may see some sharp temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a big example of dramatic temperature differences from the center of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
Much of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s ranging from the Southern Plains to parts of the Greater North.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for above-average temperatures for the Eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the highly interesting testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing the alleged 1980s sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news on Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a post-secondary prom.
Kavanaugh, in passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company was calculating the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put that in perspective, it's an audience size similar to that for the deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, protesters were caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning shouting at him as he tried to get on the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
They said to her, "You have power when most women have nothing".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's Senate nomination fully to a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which the Democratic minorities have long been pushing for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had the power, because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of taking political advantage of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of taking political advantage and weakening the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In one interview after another with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely insane".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson following the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released footage of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which said the cause of death was gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police undercover task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-7 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "lost" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", said Wade.
A volcano casts ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention has warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of pro-separatists with their faces covered who were held back by riot police were smeared with eggs and dust paint, creating a cloud of dark dust on the roads that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also small fights during the day and the police had to use the bows to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were chanting "We don't forget, we don't apologize" to fight against unionist protesters who were chanting, "Spain Forever".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region that wants independence one year after the 1 October referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose to become independent by a large margin, although turnout was low with those who are against secession boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were trained last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had been camping out through the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was carried out but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said they no longer had hope in the prospects of Catalonia achieving independence.
"Last year was one of our finest moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we are free", he said.
Despite a narrow and vital victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are trying to keep the momentum going this year with many of their best known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention and awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There's more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in the run-up to the trial at the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car forced into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car forced its way into a house in Londonderry on more than one occasion.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage was caused to the grades and the building itself.
A crossbow was also used to fire at the car at some point.
Goal of Menga winning game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who had been promoted, beat Rangers and Steven Gerrard lost for only the second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side were tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a single away game in the Premiership this season and next Sunday will play Hearts, who are in first place and eight points behind.
Prior to that game, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna at their Europa League ground on Thursday.
While Livingston continue to have a six-game losing streak, head coach Holt has not lost a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss opportunities against rude visitors
Holt's team had been winning for months before he had a goal, with his direct style of play causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the bat, then Alan Lithgow could only pass the ball wide after he slipped to reach to receive the ball from a head kick from Craig Halkett near the bat.
Those playing at their own ground were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it was the visitors who could give them problems at times.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
Rangers let the free-kick in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it in the basket from the center of the box.
By that point, the Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but they were finding the defense of the team playing in their own stadium, impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued into the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to accept the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball wide after another Livingston player split.
Balls were constantly entering Livingston's box and always removed from their players, while two requests for a penalty - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenal by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their playing style and staff have changed little since returning to the main fight, but most credit goes to Holt for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was very great at his game, putting together an immensely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at times under Gerrard, there was a lack of proper standards at the time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - they only managed to break the defence of the team playing at their own ground once - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), there were dancing people and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to stay in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and thought to be an autocrat from others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of  Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in  Deptford, in the south of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended paramedics, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and was still walking on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus detours are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers trained in disorder
Six prison officials were trained after a riot in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised officers 'Tornado' were brought in to address the disturbance, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was receiving treatment in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Flooding Soon (Dry Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves through the Desert Belt, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already established flash flood watchings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday in the rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Plateau including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from an inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the Rosa rain can be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be of benefit as the southern part is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to drought monitoring devices, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the Gulf of California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will remain a very strong hurricane Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north at 12 mph.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be heavy, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from the Bay of California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remnants is very heavy rainfall in the Bay of California, northwest Sonora, and the white desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and widespread flooding in deserts, and avalanches in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested after attempted murders
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured on Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in "stable" condition.
17-year-old teenagers, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video of what happened to speak.
Trump said Kavanaugh sent the Democratic Party's anger and hatred
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh sent the Democratic Party's anger and bitterness during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on its allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "the American people saw the bravery and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable record of public service", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't dispute, but in truth, I am dispute", he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote inside the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with death toll seemingly rising
At least 384 people were killed, many as huge waves poured onto beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) came crashing ashore as darkness began, leaving many injured and dead and destroying everything in between.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and didn't get up to go immediately and there were casualties", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Severe shocks continued to hit the coastal city of  on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in the statement that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally dispatched and without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that Palu had been hit by a tsunami, although officials said the wave had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In a dilettante video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a huge amount of water poured ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The death toll is well over 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived in full force in Palu city, where employees were waiting for armed tarpolin shelters in their office yard, they passed scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr. Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed.
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster relief, a few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep skills were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start to enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would unravel this story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other detainees at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only marked that he had left, but did not mark that he had arrived.
"I think that means the messages didn't come", he said.
Cheaters take $26,750 while the ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was checking ATMs at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "has gone after the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspected persons fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was formerly known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means int", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I, you, I we, it, we.
From Kanye to the one, to you only - simply a reflection of what we have, the good, the bad, the confusing, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of famous rappers to have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in the year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As a former collaborator with West, JAY-Z, is also spelled with or without sing and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing some 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for the IA.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA announcements, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI", said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview on Friday.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the top rated player of American Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous US government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; it's corporations that are doing it".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired inspirational people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen its AI efforts.
He said, "I believe that the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in AI".
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to persons in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a step that resolves a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbourhood in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakened the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether turnout would reach the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece.'
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union umbrella because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country's name giving it the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was throwing a small pole and preparing chairs in front of the tent armed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly on our own terms, not by commanding others", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can look to others like China and Russia and make us part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the name change would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - a figure below the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it will represent the first serious blow to the government's pro-Western ideology policy since it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before running into open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green blocks.
He struggled with one defender before fleeing many more to the edge of Brighton's box.
He then passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute to Aguero, who used his right foot to get the ball into the right side of the net by counting it from the position of Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending me some problems in his legs", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball very deep in Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the right ball to Leroy Sane with the left side very beautifully.
Sane touched the ball a little before he brought Sterling to the spot where the bat was.
The Sky Blues forward touched the ball and put it in the net just before it slipped into unapproved territory.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play Spoiler vs. the Rockies.
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the deciding game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have a chance to play in the deciding game, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West by one game.
The Rockies have managed to get a chance to continue the competition with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is crowded and the other team is probably playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
Why would you want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a practice session on Thursday and will be pitching on Sunday when he is usually at rest.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump demonstrations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I'm not contesting, but in fact, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates", he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happen right now", Trump continued.
And they're determined to take back power by using every means possible, you can see the greenness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to fly to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And I've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and green and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to the ranking Democratic Senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received a lot of negative outcry from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it?
No, uh no, wait, first of all- her body movements were not positive at all- the worst movements I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Do not tolerate those who communicate their views
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, they didn't take it seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour MPs who were not welcomed positively - because we communicated our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for her fight against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday evening General Council meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a more gentle and gentle policy that has long been wished for if, in fact, it has ever really begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions I had never agreed with in other situations - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and, in truth, it makes no difference what I say - they follow me on social media with a demand to remove me from my post as MP, denounce the politics of the centre, and tell me that I am not part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual or racist abuse every day but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party gets upset.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, not to be so vocal and then everything would be fine".
But I did not enter politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school classroom in a literally disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour Party members or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats to remove me from my post or political expediency will discourage me from acting in what I believe to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have yet to lose a game, rise to the top of the standings
Two attempts could have changed the outcome a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this exciting Tenden's Premiership day game.
They are currently first in the standings, the only team out of all ten to have never lost a game.
In the end, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing in its own ground, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been through some trials in our games so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Give Ayr the credit, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us".
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, however, a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's win by a penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, he scored a goal and converted an individual try to make the score 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
The game was then stopped due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was out on a stretcher, and once the game was restarted, Ayr went on to take the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then Ayr's head agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the team playing at his own ground started to attack again, and when given a yellow card by Struan Hutchinson for the action he played on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson messed the ball with the ground behind the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the area from which the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball that met David Armstrong from the box and sent Gregor Henry, playing on the side, for the fifth attempt of the side playing on its own ground.
Still Game's personality seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game personality Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine series will be the last one of the programme, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to official registers, he is the director of  Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's very successful restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a passage to the Pacific
The sailors stand guard at the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings will have a blue flag with the colour of the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
All around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a 19th-century resource-intensive conflict is still clear - as is the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously is expecting the result with a positive mindset", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague finds, in favour of Bolivia's claim, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chile territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
That the CJEU's ruling came only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the case of Bolivia, the last four years may have been of no help.
"The issue of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' hostile rhetoric has weakened any remaining avenues of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rivals.
He makes his comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have come to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months following Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says she is "empty hopeful" that continued sanctions and the US' objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up a weapon that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest collection of massive headdresses that will soon be appearing in mainstream stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of bizarre and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that embellished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical pieces are popping up on Instagram this summer and these designers are putting their amazing creations on stage.
The item that stood out most from Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a broad, bead-like bezel that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-covered earrings, a witch's hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had woven lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled the snorkel-and- goggles-complete deck, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep this up, good luck.
Fashion watchers predict that huge bonnets will soon appear in mainstream stores.
The very large hats come out after the release of La Bomba, the two-foot wide-brimmed hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label responsible for the impractical hat that has been widely shared on social media has put another large creation on the stage - a tin basket that is almost the size of the model wearing the dress they were wearing.
The dark orange raffinade basket, surrounded by a thin raffinade sponge and a white leather handle, was the most prominent creation in Jacquemus' 2019 Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see big seafood hats and baskets in the mainstream stores for next summer - since the designer has made such an enormous impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for the very big accessories.'
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this was followed in 2018 by another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak in his own language, he understands with his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved an A+ grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, being kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other establishments.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that of the reasons employers gave for posting to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities and more language-requiring prospects, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future as it has the potential to last you a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, at 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken by two-digit percentages.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be of most importance to the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The faut bien le faire. The faut bien is the same as the faut.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James' sports fans were eager to see him make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It's going to be over one and under 48, " Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule before the Lakers season begins.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the November ballots are cast.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have intensified over allegations of sexual misconduct with a Senate early confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign has said that the five rallies next week are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening demonstration could gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the primary.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to push him in the poll", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA determined not to disappoint as they compete for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players really believe in, and never more so than in such competitions.
So where do they say the momentum is now?
"They were ahead by six points and now they're fourth, so I think we're bringing that up as a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 more to play.
Americans, Spieth says, feel but that they have few obstacles and have much to encourage them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each boasting three points out of four.
Spieth was precise from tee to green and is leading by example.
That heartfelt cry of celebration grew as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth game even when he and Thomas were two down on two.
His punch that won the game at 15 was met by a similar cry, the kind that tells you he believes the American team is still there.
"You really want to go deep and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's what's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are in fours and considered perfect.
Moliwood were the only couple who did not go bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the 9 o'clock after Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seemed to move both to and from this lively crowd establishes who are the players offering the challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But we are talking about a European glory that is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly overtaken by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's foursomes, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never got close to getting out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch up close because of the peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so they came clean and in the lead on the final day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the determination that some, especially on the US side, were doubting.
Europe up 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead in Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US side that went bad in the morning's fourballs, which took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but could not come up for the score difference.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 Sunday one-player games to hold on to the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then worked out brilliantly to beat the unoptimistic Woods and new American player for the season Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who struggled in both games on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, arm for the morning's fourballs, returned to teammate Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But Europe did not go as planned on a beautiful day, with a little dance in the Paris suburbs.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time major winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored a bold 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point lead while entering the singles, although Furyk's side holders needed a draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's contract looks like it will be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US", he said.
Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a two-stage approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement was significant in that it did not reject unilateral, reckless denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal coherently, and even objects to the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can break us is the dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of trust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the party for this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after President Kattiv Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without pause until we achieve verified denuclearization in full and final form.
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after hours of North Korea criticizing him for making "gangster-like" demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disarm a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US takes corresponding measures.
He said Kim had told him that the corresponding measures he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students teach a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in getting all its undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's top universities often have no idea about the real basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came to me and said: "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which first started this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is an image of a student's sleeping room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, good quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a hungry mode, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to do a similar programme of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting alarms for going to bed, as well as for waking up, and be aware of the damaging effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of disappointment playing abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first win on the way since their 4-1 February tri-final win at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's side only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points clear of Ladbrokes Premiership giants Hearts.
A goal was scored seven minutes before half-time and the list of Rangers players lacking in inspiration never seemed to be coming together.
While Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence was treated for a shoulder injury after apparently being hit by an object by fans of the team that played overseas.
Gerrard made eight changes in the side that went past Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would be happy with the way his well-trained form kept their opponents in the way.
Rangers could dominate possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had scored just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-round playoff sent Scott Pittman for a goal from Allan McGregor but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only shoot from behind.
Rangers got the control but there seemed to be more hope than faith about their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a penalty on the fifteenth minute mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson ignored Kombians appeals.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half of the game but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he was only deserving of their effort.
Once again, the Rangers failed to manage a good set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerrard reacted at the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shoots in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors to play exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett winning long ball after long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their position ahead in the final stages but McGregor held on well enough to dismiss Jacobs before Lithgow went into the open by the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late call for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but once again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the  Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today, and we are celebrating... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the Geiger Conjurer has become a cornerstone of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which features those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: Is that the size of the dumbbells?
Rogers: That Geiger contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these hoods, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactive atoms in the minerals.
Evans: You say, she's certainly popular now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to detect abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal behaviour cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
These can then be injected into a protein common to many cancers.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal behaviour cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory to a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of type 2 leukemia.
Kanye West made a verbal attack in favor of Trump, while wearing a MAGA Beretta, after his appearance on SNL.
This is not good Marx
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a controversial performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for re-election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great news bracelet, he began speaking out against the Democrats and extended his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person and they say to me: "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If I was concerned about racism, I'd have left America long ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the program with a comedy sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star re-enacted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the video of West is being uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West when he posted it.
Furthermore, West had complained to the audience that had clashed with him after the quarrel over his testimony.
Bull me behind the curtains.
"Do not go out in that dress, " they told him.
They bully me!
Then they say it's lost, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lost?" and he went on to say that he would wear my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments sparked a buzz at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: In the whole studio there was a great deal of silence.
West brought him in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as Perrier's Flixkun.
West had the support of the president of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING THE FOLLOW.
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply who he is and that's a beautiful thing now.
But I have NOT chosen to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So are we, she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now what was formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of  Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend who is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to symbol then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of Game of Thrones Kit Harington speaks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that the youngster often feels they have to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones cousin Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he has strong interests in addressing the issue.
"Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?", he said.
What are we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people feel like they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because it is very clear that something has gone wrong for the youngster.
In the interview he also admitted that he will not be making Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "there are so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new production of True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a crook.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that way I gave my future family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed GOP senators' data, says dangerous lies and confounding theories
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat ascertained that the claims were being streamed from pundits and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and more lies from the caller", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly released included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a Waters staff member, the Hill reported.
This baseless allegation is completely false and utterly false, Waters continued.
The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
He shall not call into question the reasons of the Prosecutor.
It should be calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"This is a big deal if it's true", he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities about these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, he continued, and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff.
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, a poorly written imitation of a spy
It has become traditional now to look for Brexit meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of the Johnny English action-comedy imitation franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
The ironic self-satire on the subject of how obviously we are wrong, will be the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and unusually moving facial parts had his license renewed for a second time to do it all wrong - that name more than anything else shows that he is a widespread comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinema-going territories.
Of course he's the stupid secret agent who despite his strange pretensions to his sweet fashion has a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a lot of that man who contributed one note to the theme tune to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveller and mystery international man who Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, now forgotten, after leaving a kaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this latest issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was rushing to a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the blade of the screens caught his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is apparent, but the humor feels rather poor and overly odd, especially since film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels more like it's aimed at children than adults, and to me the unfortunate odd incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and focused as the silent film humor of Atkinson in the person of Bean.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the highly secretive web network of Britain's spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the icing on the cake for the imperious and struggling Prime Minister, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best as Teresa May but there is little in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that any active spy has been compromised, she'll have to bring someone back.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in a fancy building, but giving unofficial lessons on how to become an undercover operative: a bit of a joke here as English offers a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and is joined by his former partner of great patience, Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of a scolded one played by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is somewhat dismissive.
So the two inseparable always-shaking-everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, when they meet the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the thumb of the sweet tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farcical amusing behavior: dressing up as waiters, setting fire to a high-end French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins complete anarchy as he tries to use VR cuffs to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Certainly all the stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as it is, it has little idea of children's television.
Something rather moderate.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly deserves his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons working a four-day week - but being paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the companies' teachers to pass on the leftovers of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking the same pay with them.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favour of workers.
The switch to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not currently being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'anonymous directors' and 'those who profit from utility trusts'.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire stake as a Labour government may make a reduction on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence a Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"No, and certainly", said Kennedy.
I said I did and I stepped in, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that happened, after that allegation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be a very big charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know a thing, but I know this: Brett strongly denies it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not every person who mentions it can verify this.
It's 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of up-and-coming stars and an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representative group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or actions such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called clique-ism - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters, which support a number of different causes.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, at least $10 billion of which had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of committed investors and implementers helping children grow to their full potential, with a pledge to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which is What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we are more powerful when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses the Naval Fleet for blocking to hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretariat
If necessary, Washington could resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleges that Russia's expansion in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, gear and fuel substitution", he said, referring to Russia as "somebody with a single-minded" economy that depends on carbureted fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to pressure Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "silvery" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering leaving.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest position", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think he should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The poll showed more support for the exit for the election than previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential exit for the election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed in regards to potential outcomes for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD of track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to other families who are feeling the ramifications of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that nobody is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they are coming back a little different, coming back stronger, coming back to think about whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district on Friday filed a friend's case in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in the Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner and the boys in his violent gang abused her but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as the nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy "shades decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ground breaks this principle, said the case of a court friend.
The lawyers further argued in the case that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is damaging to the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear" because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, "Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are desperate in Palermo as the death toll doubles in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly dire.
"I feel very intense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she held her baby son with fever in an evacuation centre in the unfortunate town of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their flooded belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continuing severe shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he related that he felt the violent earthquake move the floor of the fifth-floor hotel he was using with his wife and daughter.
There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I was rushed to the remains of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was on the scene for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, then silence.
I don't know her and her daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying by advertising propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling down on this bullying by doing propaganda ads in our own free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media is under the restraint of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had evaded the offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are cheating women voters ahead of the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debate, analysts warn
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next midterm elections.
Emotions about this have been high, and most Republicans are already officially showing they want to lead by vote.
These things cannot be turned back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute pushback for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget a tree yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to run on Kavanaugh's nomination despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
People are saying they were already high; and true.
But they can be higher, particularly among female voters who switch votes in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans lead with confirmation.
"It's been a complete mix-up for the GOP", Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this situation and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news station.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who believes in the light of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's impasse, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while drinking assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were partying while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is going to start a new business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee teased that the intention behind Inrupt is world domination.
"We have to do it now", he said of the new business.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what type of information.
The company calls this personal autonomy through data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings in the right resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some developers on staff who are contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are flipped upside down from today to tomorrow.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated Victoria Cross cleric of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Lt. Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two nephews in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize win.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in heavy fire from spot-fire and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest courage he led the line forward before going to a skirmish on the spot alone and knocking three of the crew unconscious.
Lieutenant Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - exactly one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandmother's actions were something I know I could never get there but something very humiliating.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a wreath behind the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine that, staying up all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up deprived of the main event.
The San Jose roster included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying up until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter participant described the change to the children's cartoon as some kind of cold joke.
It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programmes", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at  Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Pig's fever, yes.
Belator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rehearsal, we can probably arrange something", Coker said.
But right now it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to arrange for our Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we turned on the radio there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government matter.
I can promise you next time it won't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and try to get more to the fans and not overdo it.
It is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realise until he went to secondary school that not everyone was like him.
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent became less important to him than winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than anyone else growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: To this day, those emotions that you feel less of, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to be able to succeed.
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was a surprise to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
Having gone through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of his age who had experienced such beautiful and cruel experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole "perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the most important thing for me was that I want to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he asked was if they already had the tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him I wasn't going to be here to be in the front row", he said.
"I was holding my hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to stand in front of a crowd of countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which was compatible with him on the Olympic march and still catches the eye.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who's out of shape stays on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his form to avoid an important, not-so-cheerful stage.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event a record 12 times, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time grand winner has split his day between enduring and working on his game from a distance in the hope of rectifying his worries.
A man who never gave the ball right even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance rafting time after time punishes misses.
And if the course alone isn't disappointing enough, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, faces the reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down from the start of the 12th singles game, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably never saw him play two games.
I've seen more, but that's the way it worked and that's the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has hardly ever reached the mile mark of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brought few intangibles to the team.
"He's entertaining, sarcastic, humorous, likes to make people laugh, and a very nice guy to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players at the age of had fun criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to watch.
It provides much more than just games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn whose great position at the front could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a tight lead ahead of the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans but finished with a disappointing 141⁄2-131⁄2 margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead position at Valderrama; we had a great lead position at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but by a small margin", Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on top with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you go in your soul and body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It's not over until you get the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we're trying to do is win this trophy, and the focus will stay there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world.
Satisfied that his players had played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I've never gone one step further than I have in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is about the individual performances we see, and that's something different to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested for your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message you want to pass on to the players, that you'll be your best tomorrow.
Now, let your partner follow you and he wants to leave and come out on top, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furyk will be looking to have his players play better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up losing as Europe did the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember at least a word of it", he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the final day.
We still have 12 important games, but you want to get to that start quickly like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When that momentum arrives on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middles.
We made our list properly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to make some miracles tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys this way because I think it covers the whole road", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era frigates in service, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class new frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The vessel was to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic post-delivery issues have shaped the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates that are in service.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some precautionary technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest refrigerators up to two years away from home ports.
However, continued delays mean that the latest technology vessels - which allow Germany to project power out of its will - will already be antiquated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it had been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media cited a number of crucial software and hardware flaws that rendered the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen - only half the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the vessel appeared to have significant overweight which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to increase future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is understood to be twice as heavy as similar class vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached a shocking €3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from the initial €2.2bn.
The problems of new frigates are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently has a shortage of ships to withstand deployment.
The official said that the problem has grown over time, as old vessels have been commissioned but no replacement vessels have been provided.
It complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust mentions the secret life of night owls
New research on the ground in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how night-flying insects use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrels and sopranos as well as long-eared night-canners and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of night owls during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will determine the frequency of the night-time call of the butterfly and which species is doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced which will create a detailed, scale-scale picture of their behavioural landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for night owls and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forests for night-flying and other associated species.
The population of night herons in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work affecting wetlands and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can insect-clogging poisonous papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The night-flyers are not actually blind.
However, because of their night hunting traditions, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes night-time farming very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of the dams and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only Threave land nightingale reserve in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten species of nightingale.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for night skiing", he said.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about night-flying still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what it takes to flourish.
It stresses the importance of checking night owls for maintenance on property as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternity ward could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Night owls are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Winter Night Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: We still have a lot to learn about our night owls and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers ready to search German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has referred to rape claims against him as "fake news", saying that people should promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 that day to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today, fake news, was said by the five-time Ballon d'Or winner while looking into the camera.
They must promote themselves by using names.
It is normal.
They have to become famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything will be fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "incompatible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for "moral damages" in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a disco, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his lap after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent a man who was disappointed with the one percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual relations, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also alleges that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to reverse the settlement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he joined Italian football legends Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'for ever' regrets that it has lost carmakers
The UK will 'regret it forever' if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was   concern that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of a no-deal Brexit on jobs is the impact of a delay at the borders.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a production halt at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on an 'exact-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border jam which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production is halted.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.
"We need the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the success to be enjoyed in the present but to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a hugely successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say for how long it would stop production, but over a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the organizer of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a Washington concern for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, she announced a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a dispute with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh over a week, which delayed a full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it could be this week, and it could be next week because of all the other things going on with the supreme court".
But now we see and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some journalists dispute this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists  who try to attract and influence the audience, although she said:  Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president, she added without citing any evidence: Look at those numbers.
Meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and we've seen this done many times over the last few weeks and this will take the place of the press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when he visits dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves so relaxed and sometimes awkwardly in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress now how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the workings of the health service, and are of benefit to the patients and communities they serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we strongly urge you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie performs emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a shoulder injury on Saturday when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went over the sideline and just fell there", said Reed.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and carrying him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a suspended sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had five total tackles before being ejected from the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be asked to pay more on the ball tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be asked to pay more on the ballot tax when buying property in the UK with the excess money used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the ball tax will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects this to rise to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher rate of ball tax when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help the homeless.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in the ball tax will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money giving a boost to the Government's efforts to fight street sleeping.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current ball tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and purchases for rental purposes - could be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to amount to £120 million per annum.
Around 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it more difficult for new buyers to make the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the ball tax so more young people could be helped to buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by stealing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to give us quotas on affordable housing to fix the 'housing shame' situation in the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of striking proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of 'no-fault' evictions.
It also wants to give councils large powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would dedicate my office to restoring the UK dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, find it as easy to buy homes as affordable UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the indinity of sleeping on the streets remains very real.
Jack Ross: My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his fundamental ambition is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is taking on the challenge of reviving the Grigal club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points behind the top-placed side.
This summer he is heading to the Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I want to play for countries as a player.
"I got a B cap and nothing more", Ross told BBC Sportsound of Scotland.
But when I was a kid I often went with my dad to see Scotland play in Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club.
Those who preceded Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not worried about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"At the moment, my success will be based on whether I can get this club back into the Premier League?
"The club is a Premier League club because of its structure and facilities", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the club back there.
Ross has just three years in his career as a manager, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from relegation top scorer to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As regards the time when Alloa took over, he recalled that it was probably a big change.
I honestly thought that the manager position was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange, since I was well off, had a decent living, and enjoyed some reasonable gains.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
I still experience this in terms of the stress and pressure of work but I just feel that the manager position is right for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel like in all my adult life I'm feeling most comfortable now.

A survey found that the best time to have a pint of beer is at 5.30pm
The summer heatwave boosted the profits of UK pubs in difficulty but put further pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales - but figures revealed that profits in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA of business consultancy, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pub sales rose by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 per cent decline in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars with a main beverage sales were the ones that fared best in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales decreased.
Pubs whose main sales are food also suffered from heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out and drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food went down to three per cent.
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the take-aways market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a sales drop of 4.8% year on year will be particularly burdensome in addition to the pressures of ongoing costs.
The hot, long summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can give us an indication as to whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed rest.
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the pace of new business start-ups.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta pages
The news has huge swells of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "good" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in Insta's popular accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has a huge amount of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a 'presentable' account to show their parents, while others have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - rape me.
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with some admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: It is worrying that so many young people are willing to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will become the voice for athletes on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete and non-race athlete and President Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the last decade.
Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish athletics community, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by being part of the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute and help run sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular critic for the BBC, was left unable to walk after suffering a minor stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: A month as of today gives me a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell whether or not I would recover or to what extent.
It was a painful job but I made a full recovery, learned how to smell again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows gives rise to differing opinions online
A breast pump company has given way to differing opinions online by advertising matching breastfeeding mothers to beef cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the world's first wearable, noise-free breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released a commercial inspired by a wry music video to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow dung-filled mattress with a record that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'm turning myself but I'm not guilty" and "In case you didn't notice, these are not beards but breasts".
The chorus goes on: "I'm pumping it out, I'm pumping it out, I'm feeding my babies, I'm pumping it out, I'm pumping it out, I'm winning my women".
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are delivered within a few days of birth.

Another commented: It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?
Another added: Advertising really cut off from reality.
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman admitting that she found the disc very entertaining.
I think this is a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would buy one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little bit too shy but I've gotten used to it.
This is a great product, someone wrote.
Someone else commented: This is a fun ad aimed at moms who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like a cow.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with the unobtrusive pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump makes no noise, has no wires or tubes and sits in a breastfeeding bra without hitting the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women using the breast pump to dairy cows we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun and relatable way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walk Silently to Tent Camp at the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite border crossings in the month remaining largely unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they presented themselves to care for a child they would jeopardise their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to search for these individuals", said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the shelters workers.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to bring arguments in their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which can lead to violent expression or attempted escape.
Lawyers said this concern is compounded at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying hello to their peers could lead to the trauma many of them are already battling.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be dealt with appropriately.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the 'war on terror' had almost come to an end in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until it had driven out from all Syrian territories both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational rumours" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return", he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of rebel-held Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoids a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win re-election provided that, as many liberal viewers hope, the denunciation and scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
What will undoubtedly be The most dramatic finale ever for a presidency!
So far, it seems that viewers are still not equal.
Since 2014, the highest-rated time-slot ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television ratings by as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"This is a situation that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She recalls a tax fraud in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? you asked her.
"He said, 'Why are you bothering me?' " Mrs. Scovell told me.
In this case there is entertainment value.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the headlines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the strength of the global economy.
Ignoring what is going on around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on the sixth floor following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of deep-backed sourcing for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather bomber jacket and the implications of the descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy by Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like this is a reality show is that every night it's giving you something", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and the daily plot development of the Trump (fighting the NFL) program, praising Kim Jong-un.
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'll fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his home at 80 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was trapped inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the television, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those eccentric programmes and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right.

Large amounts of money coming in from outside for the tightest race in the White House midterm elections
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17 congressional districts are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to congressional district realignments that have acquired two operators running for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pits of Pittsburgh's suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which extends well over the new 17th district.
The maps were reset after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally squeezed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new seventeen districts provoked a difficult campaign finance contest between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the highly-successful March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. Thought of Punishing El Salvador For Supporting China, Then Decided Not to
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some friends fired the Trump Organization administrative team.
State Department officials decided to reconnect with the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only applied to El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid, including drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have weighed on the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings began to make progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to keep migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any criminal considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been heavily criticized for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were backed up by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study of the past
The next unanticipated negative event may be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation around whether Mr. Trump's campaign was colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable in that body, as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainty, and I do not intend to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor that of his European equivalent.
There are choices to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, which would have prevented the West from resisting and supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflation points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested the president be secretly recorded and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said that the report by The Times was inaccurate.
How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonest testimony?
And on top of that, in the middle of the term they're going to vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take a long time for democracy to shift.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She managed to survive, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light the candles on that swastika table.
With a view like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the competitive game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the knowledge that the win against the Austrians, following the equally impressive result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could win something and we scored a point.
We probably won it towards the end but, all in all, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can get three points but it will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can keep trying and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between all that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but despite this there is currently a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is going well.
I hope that now we can make a move, forget the last season and succeed.
Women are worried about this retirement-related fear
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be appointed, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't take the steps to have a conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business at Nationwide.
You should start that way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance on your own - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents at length: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that that plan is ready.
Man hit multiple times by aerial gunfire in Fracombe
A man was shot multiple times by aerial shots as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and back.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a  accidental act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communication lines damaged, aid officials could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, which is an area in northern Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Pallu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of  Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency extending over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the Northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of  about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a powerful tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake hit the  Pidie Jaya regency in  Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and fatal tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, the KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself 'certainly, not guilty' when asked to give his reason, report the network.
Palin faces three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence offence, and having a weapon in his possession while drunk in connection with the incident.
His daughter alleged that her punch hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups after comparisons were made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside of central Sulawesi which is located in the Greater Jakarta area of Indonesia's capital city.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating in the media.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect in the NYC terror attack be given a rare death sentence.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bicycle rampage along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October, beating up pedestrians and cyclists who had marched in his path.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two prosecutors carry with them a possible death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed Saipov 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violent and motor vehicle destruction.
Describing the way in which Saipov carried out this "blatant, cruel and immoral" attack, prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial prior planning and meditation".
The notice of intent states that Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of  Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.'
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced in September 2009 to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the prosecution.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "certainly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a plea of guilty to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only further prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP chief said politicians had to "feel pressured" by Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that the UK would have left if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by anti-Brexit Tories who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I will defend Brexit but we need to scrap the Chequers plan.
In declaring that he is against the EU, he said: We did not fight a world war to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is absolutely not true.
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory Conservative, was also present at the demonstration, telling reporters: 'I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who are really the ones who go out into the streets and vote for us first.
Please leave the plan of  Chequers and start listening.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she said: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" to back down from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to get back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you slip if you do this.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to back down from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the army of the people of this country who have brought us success and will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists held banners reading Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, a senior socialist in the Labour party, lashed out at the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered in the party's support as the conference opened.
"These are the people who are telling us that we can have all the IT systems in place and the technology for Canada and beyond, for a frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete sham.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to carefully consider the possibility of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will carefully consider running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Massachusetts Democratic Party member spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she might replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of citizen debate at the municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she intended to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU's Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed by a plane near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that Wade Sims suffered a crash-landing injury and eventually died as a result.
Wayde came in to defend his partner and hit a plane from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot-two youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches to win the world title after his team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
On Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important part in the race.
From the inside position in the first row, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and let Hamilton ride with the others in last place in the group, something that was to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and exited just behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after a bit of wheel-to-wheel action which led to the Ferrari driver barely leaving the inside free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap at the end of last year at the age of 21.
He then led for most of the race by not changing his tyres in order to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44-lap stop zone but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen entered fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his job very well all weekend and was a real gentleman who said let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second places", said Hamilton.
That Was Really a Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vicious and disgusting and not sincere".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on these last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are robbed and vile and disgusting and not sincere", he said.
When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document - e, e, what is it?
No, you won't.
I did not reveal anything.
Look, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.
But her denial seems to have been not well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday evening rally: "I knew, that was a really bad physical attitude".
You may not have noticed, but that's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They see the cowardice, the disgust, they don't care who hurts, who gets the beating for power and control", said the president according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars suffered the Elite League of the Week loss against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead early in the game with two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the same score before Dwyer again got the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the same for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who after several defeats advanced to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams have met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed Cownie at 15:16 which brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured the Giants gained the lead until the first half of the game when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reunited and again thanks to Bouchard they again hit the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-ever lead in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory with five goals for his team in the mid-last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to ensure that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that an airplane carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes remained in the area and many are trapped in debris in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that was hanging in Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
He then climbed over the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, they left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Pallu.
"We are very saddened to hear about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still rising because many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached up to 20 feet [6 m], destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance was bringing in the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are disappearing everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pallu on Sunday and told the country's military: I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every evacuation-related task.
Ready? reported by CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after previously saying 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it could not give details on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday officials said seven of the people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane went too low.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water, which was high enough to reach the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor injury to his chest.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped with the rescue by using a floating boat to carry passengers ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded by PNG but none of the accidents involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to call Sanford.
Sanford spoke Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, phone calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argue that hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY suing a couple for kicking her out after a racist message
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a message by mistake from the mother who was complaining that she was another black person.
The couple deny being racist, and compare the case to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay when she learned that the new caretaker, Giselle Maurice, had a dark complexion when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"YEAHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gross mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was instead waiting for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and she is asking for compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, albeit without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do things like this", she told Place du Vendredi, adding that she knew it was discrimination.
The couple attacked the racist statements, saying that firing Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after offending him.
Martha sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told Post.
But what if you entrusted your children to someone who spoke to you in a goff, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
And here we go.
When comparing the case to extortion, Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had had the baby and she was in a very difficult situation.
You're going to accuse someone like that?
It's not a nice thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the legal case was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers would not relate to talking bears
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's really funny that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a young teddy bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "pleasant but somewhat disquieting" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family", she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never bothered to talk about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of them even if it's not you who accomplished something.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his own creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to give her a final greeting on the phone
Upon arrival, her daughter was immediately taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life but to no avail.
"Nad was calling me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that he was not expected to live", Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I received a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to give her a final greeting.
And I did.
I told her, Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly leaving her system.
She had died some time before and began to crumble.
All I could do was sit and wait, aware that this was all happening.
I could not cry or weep or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I was really holding back.
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I was feeling down, and tears started to fall all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and that I abandoned him.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, his brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: 'I always fear that this will be the cause of another hateful event.'
Ms. Davis created the cards, to let people know that there are people you can open up to or meet, even as a friend.
Do not be silenced - you need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He wasn't saying he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day he was really bad - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make any eye contact or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they want to rebuild it: It leaves a void in the family.
It separates us.
But we all have to keep living and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - maybe we'd get some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "sinking" amid a deep-rooted partisan paralysis.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due entirely to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they will severely weaken their attempts to put the man they want elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently occupy the seat.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Khyber Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 party changes last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are actually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stagnation of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho pinned the US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Mr. Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, they'd say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and moaning when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated assassination of character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed he has prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi spoke out when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say one thing -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court that he's on now", Pelosi said.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as conservative justice.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not right for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and expect us to say, 'Very good,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she is supposed to say without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is rare, what do you say?
She added, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was stuck somewhere else, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she woke up and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You probably think she's upset because I'm crying".
I'm fed up.
And then he didn't stop.
And I thought that was a brilliant thing.
Crying is allowed as a way to vent one's great anger partly because it is fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by the throat - a beer manager I had always been a little afraid of - and carried me down the stairs.
"You never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're crazy.
They think you're upset and feel happy that they managed to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat known as Monkey Business and dropped out of the election, Mrs. Schroeder, furious, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since this was the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she made $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men who gave her only $250.
"They think I'm taking a discount?" she said.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, fed up with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and fed up with sexism - that she hung herself.
"You probably thought I had these strong brakes", Ms Schroeder recalled about the way the media reacted to her.
You thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
She cried?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombings opening the US-China trade war have been alarming, and while the battle remains to be won, a lack of agreement between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly reacted in the same way, most recently by introducing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give in any time soon.
Washington's backing down means accepting the demands, but publicly China's surrender to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing acts wisely, the pressures of the US trade war could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is actually far more dangerous than what viewers have previously recognized", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the secession.
Europe embraces the Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is prominent in the United States, who has struggled throughout the tournament, made his tee shot in the water in the par-3 16 holes, thus giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the lowest level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 for England's Ian Poulter who played in his Ryder Cup final.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the tournament's top European player ever with 25.5 points during his career.
I don't usually cry but today I couldn't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm happy that I was able to help", said Garcia, excited after the European win.
He passes the torch to fellow countryman John Ram who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I beat Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players to ever play the game, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find those golfing sections of the course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
United States captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
We argued.
Thomas takes his hat off.
He is a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
We love these 12 young men and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to grab your hat and turn your head.
Better than that.
Red Tide update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algal overgrowth conditions in isolated areas are being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County areas - suggesting decreasing concentrations.
The Red Tide which is an overgrowth of algae extends about 130 miles of coastline from the upper Pinellas to the lower Lee side countries.
