Thousand farmers reach High Court against the Dream Project of Gujarat's Development
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from farmers of Gujarat for the Dream Project Bullet Train of the Central Government.
During the hearing of the petition, 1000 farmers had taken oath and stated that the State Government has no right to acquire their land.
The bench of the Chief Justice, taking the Centre's lead, gave an ultimatum that if the Centre does not submit a reply on the land acquisition by 26th, the court will issue a final order.
The High Court has also issued a red flag against the Central Government for flouting the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
Further hearing will be held on 26th September.
The High Court took the state government to task after objecting to the pledge of a thousand farmers from eight districts of Gujarat in the Rajya Bullet Train Project.
You are misleading the court.
Your presentation said that only 4-7 farmers had objections, but here a large number of farmers have been sworn in.
Anand Yagnik, advocate for the farmers, argued that the Central Government has not submitted a reply to the most expensive project of the country worth Rs.1 lakh 10 thousand crore, which is linked to more than one state, even after the delay of more than 3 months, and has not followed the guidelines of the company.
The Centre is trying to avoid the case going to the High Court by not filing a reply.
Since the Centre and the State governments have no strong defence against land acquisition, the farmers are being threatened by the collectors as a last resort.
Blackmails are being made to seize the land as it is newly conditioned.
Threats of land seizure are being made if land is not acquired.
Despite the Supreme Court order dated 10th August, the Centre is not responding to the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will go to the Supreme Court again tomorrow to seek compliance with their order.

The farmers will inform GICA that the agreement for the bullet train with GICA of Japan has led to the loan of thousands of crores for the bullet tram.
But Japan has not yet paid the installment of more than 300 crore.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency on par with the euro, yen, and pound, including the dollar.
India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
International Desk: India and Russia have today reached an agreement on S-400 missile defense system amid threats of US sanctions.
The MoU will be signed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of Russian President Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is being negotiated between the two countries with the US dollar as the payment for the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
The US imposed sanctions during China's deal
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
This ban made it almost impossible for China to purchase missiles using US dollars.
However, in recent years, China has tried to establish its currency, the yuan, as an international currency against the dollar.
Following this initiative, China has been making constant efforts at the international level to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The five billion dollar mega defense deal may be subject to a Countering American Adversaries Through Sections (CAATSA) ban.
The US last month imposed a ban on China's purchase of the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia had already started setting up alternative arrangements for this deal.
Earlier, the US embargo on the leased INS Chakra repair deal between India and Russia, which was estimated to be worth about 2 billion dollars, was seen as a setback.
Economic analysts claim that to get out of such a situation, India should exercise the Rupee-Ruble exchange as the international currency.
It is noteworthy that all defence deals India has done with Russia so far have been done through dollars.
Why the American Sedition Act?
President Donald Trump signed the Katsa Act in August, which aims to protect Russia's advanced missile defense systems. The law is designed to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
The US law was designed to take into account the activities of Russia.
These include Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, its annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Then, suddenly, a secret that had been hidden for thousands of years was revealed.
The story is about a man in Turkey who made a big discovery while making repairs to his house.
He collided with a secret door when the wall of his basement broke down while he was repairing it.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he was confronted with a thousand-year-old city hidden underground.
These city pictures show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food and drink.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident dates back to 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
The wall of the basement of the house broke down while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city called Derinyuku was found at a depth of 280 feet below the ground.
Its depth was equivalent to an 18 story building.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with rooms, kitchens, schools, churches, tombs, etc. and everything from ventilation to preparations.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy doors, which are to prevent intruders from entering the underground city.
Each floor of it can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built during the Byzantine period between 780 and 1180 AD to protect the people from the Arab-Byzantine wars and natural disasters.
Became a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this but this is the largest underground city.
Only half of the city is accessible, but the site has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

It seemed as if it was raining stones
Richard Branson went on this expedition last Sunday.

I've never been so scared in my life.
The weather was clear and we were climbing upwards.
And there was a great shout, and the rocks were broken in pieces, and the great stones were thrown down.
All these stones were as big as small cars.
It seemed as if it was raining stones.
The stone passed by the son's helmet.
Branson wrote, "As the stones started coming at me, everyone ran for their lives.
Me and my son Sam were together.
We both hid behind a rock that was nearby.
Stones were passing overhead.
The sound of stones beating in the ear was resounding.
Everyone closed their eyes.

I thought that maybe no one would survive today.
My nephew thought we were buried in the rocks.
According to Branson, my nephew Noah was walking five minutes ahead of us.
He was the first to see the mountain breaking.
After the stones stopped falling, he came towards us.
A large rock fell where we were standing before.
Noah thought we were all buried underneath it.
For a while he lay there in a stupor.
After a while, we all came out from behind the rock, and his life came back to life.
And it came to pass when they came into the camp at the even, that they embraced one another, and wept.
When they arrived at the camp in the evening, they all hugged each other and cried.

A postmortem report on a bird revealed the truth
International Desk: The unconscious fall of birds and their impact with a window in Minnesota, USA, has sparked a lot of rumors.
Some said the birds had fallen prey to the blade magic, while others began to associate it with the phenomenon.
When the incidents began to escalate in many places in Minnesota, the police began investigating and exposing the mystery behind the incident.
The birds became addicted.
Police were getting many complaints of strange behaviour of birds and falling on the road.
The Gilbert Police of Minnesota, distraught by the constant calls, began investigating the matter.
Gilbert Police collected the birds, who had been smashed against windows and vehicles, and performed a post-mortem, revealing a shocking discovery.
The bird was drunk when it collided with windows and vehicles.
The big question for the police was how did the drugs get into the bodies of these birds?
Is someone plotting to kill the birds?
Or there was another story behind his drunkenness.
A bird was drinking from a tree.
The police solved the case with the help of experts.
It is said that most of the birds were getting intoxicated by eating a type of berry.
In England, such berries are called fermented berries.
The sugar in such berries is converted into alcohol by fermentation.
And they were eating the fruit, and they were drunken.
This is why we saw birds flying very low.
The birds were in a state of delirium, which caused them to collide.
Police told how to escape
Gilbert police said that it is not possible to stop the birds from eating the fruit.
They have given their own way to save him.
Police said that the window and windscreen with high reflection could be prevented from crashing.
Police told people through Facebook not to pay attention to any rumors as there is no black magic.

The High Court is likely to give its decision on Thursday on the petitions of a Muslim group seeking a review by a grand bench of the Supreme Court's 1994 decision on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Mosque ownership claim dispute.

The bench had secured him on July 20.
This particular finding was objected to in the 1994 decision in the Ayodhya case of a fundamentalist M. Siddiq M. Israel Farooki.
The resolution stated that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddique has died and his legal heirs are representing him.
The Muslim groups have argued before the bench headed by the Chief Justice that the decision requires reconsideration by a five-member panel on the High Court's observation.
Because it will have an impact on the Babri Masjid-Ram Temple, land dispute.

Sachin recalled the day when he first saw Prithvi Shah batting and said something about him.
Sachin shared his experience about 10 years ago his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shah batting.

Praising the Prithvi Shah, the secretary said, "What I have seen, she (Prithi Shah) learns quickly.

Adaptability is required to play for long periods in different terrains and conditions.
I think that the Earth has the ability to play in different situations in terms of the game and this is the greatest strength of the Earth.

Did the title shock you?
How could the court language of the Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the Somanath temple sculptor and villain of the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Shanta Pandey, a historian at Delhi University, has shown that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
When the Swami Nath Trust recently honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their services to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask whether Sanskrit was just a folk language or only the language of the so-called upper-class Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birjdar of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Biradar, who speaks in a Sanskrit that even the rich can understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its publication.
The word Holy Quran is Sanskrit in their eyes.
Ku + ran means the voice or message of the messenger heard on earth.
He not only studied in the school of Solapur but today he is counted among the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji, who lived a simple life, did not seek to go to America or other countries to give lectures as a Sanskrit scholar to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a scholar of Sanskrit.
There he taught himself Sanskrit.
To learn Sanskrit from America, the enthusiasts have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In India, most universities except the Banaras Hindu University also have a PhD thesis in Sanskrit written in the language of the state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that education in the Takshashila and Nalanda universities was taught in Sanskrit.
The spread of Sanskrit in Afghanistan Shantha Pandey has said that the court language of the Sultan of Ghazni was not only Sanskrit, he also recorded that he had his coins in Sanskrit.
The coins "Mahmood Surathran" have the verses of the Quran in Sanskrit and the author of the grammar of Sanskrit, Panini, is a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru in his My Hind's Philosophy, in a large chapter "The Power and Sustainability of the Sanskrit Language", says that the Pashtun language of the Afghans and the Pathans is derived from Sanskrit.
Now it is generally accepted that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprise in the constitution is that the chief drafter of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and several other members of the Constituent Assembly, both Muslim and South Indian, proposed that Sanskrit be made the national language of the country.
When the National Language was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949 in Hindi versus English, the Deputy Minister of External Affairs Dr. B.V. Kaskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the National Herald of 11 September 1949 gives an idea of the revolt of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to determine any national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu are included in our Constitution as official languages, but not as national languages.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is the mother tongue of only 24,821 people.
Prime Minister Nehru had spoken with great respect about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the chapter on Sanskrit in his book, he turns to Sanskrit and details the importance that Sanskrit scholars have attached to it: "Even in 1874, Sir William Jones said, 'God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its structure is extraordinary.
It is more complete than Greek, more plentiful than Latin, and more noble than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, when it has been considered a vernacular".
Today, Sanskrit has become the language of prayer and the oath taken by members of Parliament like Union Minister Smriti Irani.
We need to preserve the Sanskrit heritage and make it a living and folklore language.
If the dead language of Israel, Hebrew, can be revived, then Sanskrit is a living language.
It is only worth making a serious effort to make it a folk language, rather than making a symbolic or symbolic attempt.
After the airport welcome, Narendra Modi asked who to come with him?
