A Republican strategy to stall the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only found 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments, starting in 2009, enacted new laws that made it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID, as well as proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and strip citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities therefore hurried to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, don't have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often it costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity document.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote most heavily for Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Moreover, those same States authorise members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
Those measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems like two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to create a help service to voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have led to a fall in the rate of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws that favored shortening the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of the voters who voted early were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state's electors.
The same thing happened with the Hispanics.
They represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
Some damage was contained.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed a law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: To be tested or not to be tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives incorrect results, with false negatives or even false positives, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant, doubt whether screening should be done.
To take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
In the studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of infection was detected among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there is a 30 to 40 percent chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
So I recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is indeed necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case he should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, offer treatment.
We are increasingly setting precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend you get tested anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether you should have the test or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool that allows the evaluation of the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and got enough exercise, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent", said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is very damaging to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", declared spokesman André Beaulieu.
A promising finding: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity also promote the disease, according to the CDC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that lifelong physical activity is protective against breast cancer", they add.
The feeding
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Meat products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer", they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing the concerns and family history of each person with their doctor.
"Screening does not cause cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a huge stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's the particle whose existence the Standard Model predicted: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has yet to be observed empirically.
But it's not entirely clear to physicists that it's the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that a new particle exists and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still needed to be completely certain.
Anyway, we assume that this is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim.
There is, in this great world, a universal and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule, and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is a law of these characteristics in it as well: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And then there are the bosons, a bunch of dirty anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which is quite extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I should stress here, are not the exotic beasts that we might think.
In fact, if you can read this account, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or "particle of light", that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In effect, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that particular environment - much like throwing a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it's another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it, you have to reach extremely high energies, a bit like a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
This is why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN's (the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The electromagnetic field analogy is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a refrigerator door by itself.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what "can all this research do?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (SM), and further allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and SM predictions.
Many, for their part, are eager to meet, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that would plug certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation relating to gravity (ups!) or to dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we haven't found such differences at CERN so far.
The aftermath
The implications of such research on our daily lives are difficult to predict, but let us not think that we are wrong in saying that it will have none.
So let me show you: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would bring about.
They were looking at scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was considered more of a "laboratory device".
I mean, imagine that.
And furthermore, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light-sensing device in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was by no means his original intention, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That's not to say, of course, that the activities of the LHC are necessarily going to transform our lives, but you never know...
The best way to die... is to have to.
At its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was killing him had given him a two-year reprieve.
"I had been given five years to live, but I've been here for seven", he says, slurring his words, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this", he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting before a delicious lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating", she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pee standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
To return to childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept that regression", he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
Every patient who comes into the Victor-Gadbois hospice has cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provide "curative" care.
Mrs. A., 89,'s greatest fear is that she will die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no more desires in this life", she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on her to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers offers body care and food assistance.
It's palliative care that's given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 residents.
It is very little, since we know that we will all eventually die.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort or spiritual comfort.
The dying man is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the lawsuit.
Diabetics can't control their blood sugar anymore.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the evening.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help patients and their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, a director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man savouring his last family reunion in the backyard, perched between their pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 with cancer", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problems of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the end of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing facility.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent palliative care practitioners such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
"Recently", she relates, "I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain without any relief.
I fear that patients will wish to die just because they are not receiving the proper care".
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubbornly with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already at their lowest when she left a grueling course of chemotherapy.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she said that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting", she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There are no all-powerful careers.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not responding to their requests once their pain has been relieved by a hospice team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is used to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want relief".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP businessmen, party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An industry that came too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system gets pulverized once we've hunted down the mainstream media", quips Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to highway contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, the clandestine funding of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the inception of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved $1 billion in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he added, while hoping to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government interviewees, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "the Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been recording a series of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have been brought against engineers of the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a commotion by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted to having organised an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $ 736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating the bills by 30% to 40% as fake extras.
In addition, an organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of the money in the election campaigns was dirty money
She says that the investigation that will eventually be carried out will be "a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We're cleaning up the wounds, but it would take a clean investigative unit in Montreal and being on high alert to make sure that shady practices don't happen again.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, says that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is worried above all about the role of "elected politicians who are aware of the scheme".
Estimating the proportion of dirty money that went to financing electoral campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he quipped: "I have been told that this is nothing but a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that won't change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
It calls for a complete review of the system for awarding public contracts and financing political parties: 'We cannot go any further down; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable us to rebuild the house on a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws'.
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I move forward day by day by his side.
The technical staff has also been very helpful.
And those elements push me every day to raise the bar of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes too fast in football.
But I'm not getting hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
He's going to benefit from competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
It makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of insight into my positioning.
He's backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Ancelotti's the man the team needed?
Of course, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect from all the technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our leader's position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the last eight in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of a lot of very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16 final.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You've got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and stay there for the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
On the economic side, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the League One cup like last season, would that constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we're going to put all our efforts into winning that championship.
Last season we didn't get very far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year's gonna be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It's only natural that they expect a lot from us when you think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've accepted it completely.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, they still find things to blame us on a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We'll never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to get a game project going.
A team is built on time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, who after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last eight, and they have invested a lot too!
Given the sums invested, we'd imagine you'd be 15 points ahead by the end of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That just goes to show how exciting League One is.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a Zlatandependance.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he's proven to every team he's ever been on that he's a great player, a world-class star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
And he respects the men around him, too.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes the others to step up their game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a letdown.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
I'm playing good games for the national team today.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is because of that that we have an exemplary behaviour today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of the Blues?
It's getting results.
They're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on 16 October in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never seen a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is the opposite of today's monetary exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as is often the case with technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It's not that impressive compared to the global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It described bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and deals with the exchanges.
With bitcoin, all nodes of the network are at once bookkeepers, verifiers, coin issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file's content, it's also possible to ensure that bitcoin's changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge thrown to the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file-sharing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "make" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular imprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If, in order to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be left as an orphan, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is regularly halved, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed with each increase in computing power.
Life on the network has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
"The fault used does not affect the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes account of the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars changed", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a textbook on the currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology, as well as in the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but in 2013 there could be a change", he predicts.
The ECB also envisages in its report a reassessment of the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are supposed to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan peasants above all, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul unharmed, watched by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price for the darkening of their peasants by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They've become speculators, taking government land to resell as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
The people, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, no reservoirs have been fixed or major irrigation systems repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, governmental control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take them over.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without transportation to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving the huge Buddhist site to be excavated by international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also require the restoration of normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent.
The French troops left on November 20th.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These jobs, which were aimed at obtaining local labor, have helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a memento after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often situated at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written petitions with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free them from the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, we would need to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that would reach them directly.
A Constitution with force in Egypt
He is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago the Head of State gave the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years now, Egypt has been using an interim text, modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial muddle.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the deadline for the submission of proposals to the Council for a decision on the application of the new rules to the Commission.
A referendum should be held within the next two weeks.
A very short time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal was voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my text or I retain full powers", powers that are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of whom are Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals didn't show up for the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people were added yesterday morning, as substitutes, in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As might be expected, the articles voted on were unanimous.
Commentators are also pleased that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday evening, comprises 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, is finally identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and of their respect towards the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".
The liberals' fears are further heightened by the fact that the university's next rector would be far less moderate than the current one.
"At this time, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ed].
And the question that might be asked in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule on all this".
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in number compared to what they were under the previous regime.
Another point of contention is the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights associations have called for.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains, and from now on insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive thing, she said, was the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to appear on TV last night, demonstrations are expected this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the Holy Land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comforts and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
The river Jordan where Jesus was baptized is worth visiting.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism pool" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy sites is in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, to the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian World Ombligo, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site in the Jewish world, the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then be realized.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are found on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there on your own, only those who are dedicated to climbing.
The rest of you can reach this historic summit by the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, the mountain's summit was supposedly inhabited by pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them are worth visiting, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It houses the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological items.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
In its exhibition of paintings it has canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worthwhile to visit the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you're in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of these is home to swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brackish water that easily supports even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes around here are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo courses of treatment with salt water, brine and curative mud and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
Playing the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very spot, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll along the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English is poor: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shillings (currently 1-3$,8 shillings).
Urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the country's only metro line, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are celebrated as the Sabbath.
From Friday night until sunset Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is disrupted.
But Sunday morning marks the beginning of a new work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales, and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes made with beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground garbanzo, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities, you don't see stray dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk free" in a commanding way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snoreers love crowded places and don't reject treats.
The cost of renting a car, depending on the brand, will be from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Plus the insurance, which comes out to 15 bucks a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will be 15 shekels a day.
Museum admission is an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than the same index in 2010, before the visa regime was canceled on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and the Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders debate the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, there are already swindlers in the country who trade in "fake" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since December 1 a law has been in force, according to which every immigrant worker must take an examination to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those intending to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
It is not enough to pass the language test, but also the Russian history and the legal foundations test.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even for the purpose of obtaining and renewing the work permit.
The only exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law will not apply to persons who obtained their educational certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, there are more than 160 such centres open in Russia right now.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the State Duma deputies and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor migrants, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev claims, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, will put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but on arrival they are deceived, deprived of their passports, not paid the promised salaries", confirms the Head of the Directorate of labor immigration of the Tajikistan immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little chief!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as it is their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families have nothing to even feed the children, let alone dress them, shoe them and buy them school supplies.
As they reach adolescence, these boys venture into work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, to recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior".
However, when it comes to the language law, rights advocates point out an important point.
The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they don't have that status, there's no exam and, consequently, no official job.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or no strangers allowed"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
Besides, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
The Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea", Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be cheap, buy yourself a painting"
The first day of the language law came into force, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several "fake" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they did not come to the new owners as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who failed the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Squeeze shooting during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeeze seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on gun ownership will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "meaningless rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, Russian criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were committed in the six months of 2012, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation on the civilian arms sector will not be an obstacle for the criminal to turn to the black market.
Now, according to him, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation of illegal weapons proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market in arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting orders for guns
The first, "army or military vestiges", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police stores and those directly stolen by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are coming out of military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault", comments a former military man.
According to Baranets, the gun makers also put their sand grain.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and that distribute arms under the yoke to the black market, including Moscow, have now proliferated", says the expert.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own production there, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons", the former military man explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning in Public Administration.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose subject revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market guns have come from "gun-related officials", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
Through some dealer, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They cross it off the register and they pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines", he says.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the plan for the discovery of crimes needs to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from the dealers of illegal weapons", adds the official.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a man who would take me to a "squint" where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I only found out there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets has been
"To get a gun, I need a friend with connections", says the shopkeeper. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much".
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to get there too, say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell you that his daughter had a tooth fall out".
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I won't rat on him.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was about to be published.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album that didn't have "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we set a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the gun fires well, we start negotiating", the expert describes the procedure.

Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents are required for this, and no personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", the headline of the advertisement says, "to buy a gun or a machine gun".
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I'm buying a gun TT. Moscow", he laconically formulated his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fake websites and catches those who want to buy firearms with both hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia

I've heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make the orders.
The buyer pays through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the gun is hidden", says Dmitri Kislov, press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Guns".
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you are left without a weapon and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of bogus websites and catches up with those who wish to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to mine coal in Siberia", he says.
Makarov for a hundred bucks .
Experts estimate that the cost of illegal firearms can be anywhere from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300 dollars.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.

According to the ministry's official statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and grocery store employees in the U.S. go on strike.
As many as a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been unleashed in the United States against the low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one is sure whether this wave will reach the nine points or whether it is destined to lose strength and slow down in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases for Walmart and fast food workers, the protest organizers' goal is to create labor unions in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", the day when the orgy of sales began in the United States, which captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed picket lines in protest with the unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the corporation, whose products are aimed at people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why a lot of low-paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and variety of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of lifting equipment or hand scanners.
On Black Friday, the participants in the demonstration demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who makes $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
That's about 1.1% more than what you're spending on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay raise on the shoulders of the consumers, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend a ridiculous $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are complacent that the protest took place in only nine states and that it caused no loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations stunt" organized by the workers' union.
"Box is free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and that is why there are none at the moment), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York state law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York are paid $8.90 an hour.
Nobody makes less than them in this town.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that kind of money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers would walk by McDonald's and work there, behind the counter, part-time after school, even though they were still living with their parents.
Few saw this as their main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble across some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that the fast food sector create trade unions for workers.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing activists in the labor movement with evictions and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to take over the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Disagreeing
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular the city's City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work".
The protesters were joined by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, fooling the brain is not so easy"
The subject of augmented reality, which is so popular among lovers of modern technology, is lately seen mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google demonstrated a moving model at its annual conference and then, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company's scientists, the glasses were already a thing of the past.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its mass has been caught in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look five to 10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
It must free the world from the computer to our world, the physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly VR headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think it's overrated?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, the issue of privacy remains to be resolved, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not in single movements, but shorter ones.
Moreover, the gestures were captured not by the device's camera but by a wristband that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
It's very large right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work primarily on designing new kinds of sensors that can accurately measure the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the rate of 1000 fps.
But the question is not megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to the algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not just the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axis.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I'd be very useful for my work with an equivalent of such a device, but one that doesn't require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually the infrared emitter and the second is the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible tuning fork sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the curvature of the cameras' location and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, to spend all the time holding high a smartphone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from glasses to a smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any ordinary mortal.
There's a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there's no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the octave might well be the addition of tactile sensation.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared to add tangible to these "airborne images". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to that you would feel if someone were blowing into your fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this too a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he thinks he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, it still has to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality so appealing to researchers, that many things are in a state of full conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of the St. Petersburg art and scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing about them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from head to toe, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical St. Petersburg accountants, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
Moreover, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens the inhabitants to smiles and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took up the organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, because he has matured to play such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I'm a fashion designer and I'm all about appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at initiating a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was on display.
I realized that was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with new wave artists, with the after-the-show ones in Gaza and Nevsky, who led "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all this came together in your Art Clinic... for me it was important to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought to the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; the basic education and training they received from us.
Gallery D137, the Griboyedov Club, is the remains of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regular customers went.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was done in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, and that was the end of my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, the honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate ways.
- There's something about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them clearly expresses the current and the occurrence.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibit, "Russian museum clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and scary.
But clowns, everything is muddyed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the saving of the world by a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now they follow you by your clothes, oriented to the outside, but not to the inside of the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't even be shaking hands, but spitting in his face.
And the deception will be removed when the change of clothes.
We saw you in the role of a city planner a few weeks ago.
Who better than me to be!
- Fine, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to get together in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplons another.
Now everyone's split up into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everybody.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by the thousands!
- You'll see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 never come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything withers away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you've accomplished.
When I was younger I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which is what people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm all for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: culture officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones, everything was different, kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could very well be experts, but they are closed, because you need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate these and open the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is flourishing.
Errata, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has more culture, there's land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we have more writers now than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft convoys with humans on board are off in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in sterile conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there's not much to choose from.
In fact, only two are actual planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher of the State Institute of Astronomy, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
It can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora were addressed.
Experiments with plants have been going on for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the brood of insects in orbit, the little fruit flies, the drosophilus.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo develops in the weightless environment.
The result is a normal chick.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support, stand on its own feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks flipped randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we managed to get the chicks to hatch, but then we left because it was impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "mini-arch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent into space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely the case with biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction in space has not yet been tackled directly.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, having lost their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could tell if it's after a flight into space.
She may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, this question has not been answered", says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had twice been in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, the astronauts are counted, who after long flights have all turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if I may say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In zero-float conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its natal element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on land arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something", says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very rapidly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of birth-promoting drugs.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It's impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special training suit, like an adult.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we will do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a person totally unsuitable", predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will become a reality, as human beings in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
NKU chief: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
The Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation in public procurement, although its implementation is lax.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (SCO) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack", so describes the current situation.
The joint inspections by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother the businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor require obligations", says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Congress of Deputies you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is it exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started to do about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public tenders should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control is not yet complete, we have obtained very interesting differences.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely this kind of common control that could help us to stop investing efforts in the formulation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest price) to avoid enrichment and, eventually, criminal actions.
But not because the lowering of the limit on adjudications means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You speak of the problems in our country with the transfer of the legislation which regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office like our NKÚ or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, but as Germany has a federal organization, the audit courts are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are controlled in Germany by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for the local law, is it simpler than ours?
I would not normally like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
I'm sure you don't, but I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries which we take as models have to face a great many problems.
If they weren't, they wouldn't have any benefit from working with our office, would they?
As far as the legislation in our country is concerned, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the control measures.
Since we are carrying out ex post checks, we must expect a certain delay.
For now, it is seen in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed.
Does he think that the passage of this law is beneficial or does it represent a bureaucratic entrapment?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation becomes "harder" and impossible to comply with.
Under the previous rules, the persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any law not respected in the field of public procurement was a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I think not this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal error, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this initiated path takes us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother businessmen with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper.
Is the "švarc" system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We changed the law and we allowed it", but you can't say we'll just walk away.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads are ice-covered, but most of them are passable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are passable, extreme caution is required on some.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they were covered with ice and snow.
Temperature dips and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero, during the day thermometers will rise slightly.
The snow has stopped in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Montes Metálicos, snowfall reaches nearly 12 inches [30 cm].
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the highway operations control center in the region.
The R6 motorway and the first-class highway in the region are now open to traffic.
However, extreme caution is advised, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some of them still have sections of ice and snow.
Increased attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
The region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the Krkonoše Mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow on the highest parts of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear and partially cloudy today, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range from minus three to plus one, with a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although extreme caution will be required and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
Early morning will be freezing, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is emerging from the information from the region's highway operations control center.
The D5 motorway is passable with almost no restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen-Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case also sections with ice plates are noticeable.
Drivers should be more careful, especially on the less-traveled roads in the Šumava area.
The region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially shed snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers cleared the snow overnight; on the Šumper road, about three centimeters of snow accumulated, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are traces of snow.
Drivers in the Červenohorské port will encounter half-disposed snow in the direction of Jeseník", an official from the Šumper highway administration confirmed to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections where the tracks are still wet.
The following is the list of municipalities in the region of Ústí nad Labem:
Operators of the North Bohemian highways have reported complications on various sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it snowed or froze, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
The temperature remains below freezing even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road, but in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
There are no service complications so far.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
Weather forecasters say conditions have been ideal overnight, with rain and snow melting expected during the day and clear skies and ice at night.
Unfavourable conditions have been reported from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by tree branches that had arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy in our concerts
They say that in less than a month the world will end, what do you think about it?
It's just one of the many other scare stories we like to hang on to.
The Tap Tap band, we like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
In December, you're organizing a very original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
It's a state-run charity event that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea at first, then we all worked together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, cancelled".
It's currently very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it's just gonna be the last one, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The songs will be linked together simultaneously thanks to a special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charity events and concerts...
We are doing our best to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised from the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
A equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The pupils of Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have the financial means to pay the teachers and we are making an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Various groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to make a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there will be performances by Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more information, please refer to www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs have to travel in the luggage compartment and also we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well, and both the Czech Republic and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which continues to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we just returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that, in the East, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, so it is still not uncommon for a person to travel alone in an electric wheelchair through the city center.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, is not there.
Fortunately, a civil society association has been set up to try to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we follow the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and perfection of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in public and to be able to go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of disabled people to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A society that respects or has no barriers is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, everything will begin to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with great willpower.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band right now, but if we look back a few years, what made you guys form the band in 1998?
I got into education at Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, I play the saxophone, among other things, I started an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lada Angelović says, it got a little out of hand.
However, the popularity didn't come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It's true that connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you really intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is received with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few things extraordinary, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because disabled people are not abandoned beings who suffer and who should be pitied.
There are people who are capable of living a full life and developing, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and require a certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal for two days, go to the pre-test and spend a lot of time travelling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and the will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 pm
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The concert aims to raise the necessary funds to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre at Jedličkov ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission in the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
The meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week accepted Poland as the twelfth member of ESA.It is the second ESA member country from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intensive cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in the commissioning of ESA projects in the following years.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began long before that.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The above-mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a major proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a dredge was built in Poland to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown, and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dredge or for its braking.
Information about this dresina is limited to what is recorded in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all military missile engineering projects and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, the Society is first referred to with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics was proposed.
At that time, projects for artificial satellites had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since early 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first flown on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rockets began air tests in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was four feet, four inches long and weighed about 30 pounds.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission was to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
The space available for the volume on the Meteor-1A was 0.4 litres, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aero Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude.
Later versions were built, the Meteor-2H and the Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
Suspending the social work law is not the answer.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, like those in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This means that the various economic forms and the national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic stresses.
This is the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, is trying to cut distances and thereby 'bring down' the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over the largest part of the market and thus increasing his profit margin.
The Commission has also proposed a new approach to the problem of the unemployment of young people, which is based on the principle of equal treatment for men and women, and on the principle of equal treatment for men and women.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment this creates, the social expenditure of the State necessarily increases.
All this makes it possible for businessmen to be totally disinterested in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profit.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the disposal of their own people without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This is achieved, on the one hand, by the system of financial obligation in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing gaps between the rich and the poor.
For a number of years now, food delivery points have been operating in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help is already approaching one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures in virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation: people, pressed by a deep decline in their social status, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a poor wage at the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will one day arrive in the country.
Do you have to wonder where it came from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty either passes from one country to another or never arrives, because Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans still work for a tiny fraction of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media assert to the full that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that managing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital is defending tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not interfere in the economy by meddling in control.
The question then is whether private capital does not influence the political process and, therefore, the whole state through its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, practically very powerful and omnipresent, in every state.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is almost universally reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, lacking the financial means, commission drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
The European Parliament has been a great help to the people of Europe in the past, and it is a great help to the people of Europe today.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly finding themselves in a situation like the one described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were dealing with force".
In exchange for bribes, illegitimate favors and help to finance rocks or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people went to the polls with the vote already cast"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously discussed that the only remedy for such a grave situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appianus thought of Pompeia, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy into autocracy forever.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on reckless preferences for individual gain without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the present situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy as a definite pause, awaiting the next coup.
The really shattering fact is that the current elite is completely oblivious to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
Suspending the law on public procurement is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for other ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which both strengthen the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none". Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
The second is that the Palestinians are being supported by the Israeli state, which is racist, which is committing genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and which is labelling Israel a terrorist state.
The European Union is not only a political force, but also a political force, and it is also a political force, and it is not only a political force, but also a political force, and it is not only a political force, but it is also a political force.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who profits from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is in the front row.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so clear is whether these characters were always the ones who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Of course you are.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have major holdings in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the charter of the Rothschild's Bank of America, started printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to outline a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary to such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamic of triggering a crisis and then offering a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives to ensure that the European Monetary Fund is properly managed and that the European Monetary System is properly functioning.
So after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the resulting outbreak of World War I, they tore apart Tsarist Russia with the onset of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and without military and economic justification, with the surrender of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create a conflict situation covertly as a result of the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were occurring on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much from the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or whether all he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way that war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel set the stage for a third war.
If the international bankers were to succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline casualty, now along with the Arab or, more generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within its own country but also on an international scale.
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as in our country, the international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current Israeli President B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are David Rockefeller's words in 1994 now seen: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and that they may not buy or sell, unless they have the name of this monster or the number of its name.
You have to understand it: whoever has two fingers on their foreheads, add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six".
If you get rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive prospects: throwing the Shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of theocratic rule, was not within his reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further intensified by the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran animosity.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before they occupied the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by a cover story an extravagant point: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew who examined the location in the country for the shooting of a superproduction of science fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan devised by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie appear true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The movie combines the moods, and on the one hand, we have well-documented footage from Tehran, and on the other hand, the credits sequence shows iconic photographs from the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the movie, and there's not much difference in that.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the halls of the office, on the phone.
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a brilliant way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his manner no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Little Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it at Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places.
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he does it quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything does not come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis at Tehran airport lurks, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search for its clue turns into madness).
Argo's weakness is the uncontrollability that comes from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and they are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little of its dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, to appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But to have it collapse, that's going to be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how overblown the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflating
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a quota of 40 per cent of women in management positions in large European companies", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from higher life insurance rates because they are objectively less risky.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted by people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013", Nacher reported.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance; or the directive shades the size of hens' cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter butter' or the withdrawal of the classic bulb from the shops has been criticised.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union's machinery often takes such decisions under pressure from some commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
One lobbyist was behind the demand, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimetres long and not have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only seeking to harmonise national standards which had not been harmonised until now and which were only making it more difficult to market them.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails food waste.
The winner of the survey could be the EU's requirement from last year that inflatable balloons must be marked with a warning that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
I was referring to an American study which shows that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of death in children from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of sleeping bags by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The regulation on European officials is equally absurd: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The organisers of the survey were also interested in the possibility of paying those countries which do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of thinking did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation,' said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that there was a lot of cereals produced in our country and that as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from landlocked countries.
The grant for a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Unbound for the supply of services by air.
While the guidelines of the Member States are often the subject of criticism, the EU's efforts in the area of regulation and also more effective functioning and development throughout the Union are, according to several experts, more deserving of our recognition.
The most serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the Member States have obtained in budget negotiations.
The Czechs, like other countries in the Union, are also affected by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc rum, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was called "tuzemák".
Only products made from the distillate of sugar cane may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
The official list of protected designations of origin in the EU already includes, among others, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the marzipan from the German city of Lübeck and the ham from Parma, the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and even the hops variety from Žatec.
As EU protected maras, they can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the barquillas from Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If our country was all right, then I wouldn't run for office.
But I can no longer bear to see how the theft has been carried out in our country for the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, how taxes and the retirement age are raised.
I had no ambitions of being a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon afterwards he is on his way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results of the senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need the biggest leverage possible and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that criticizes in the bar or in front of the TV, but that we trample anyone who wants to initiate a change.
Add to this the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I'm accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He's running for president with financial claims and criminal liability of politicians and declaration of property over twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
As president, he has no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was part of a lobbying group for the profession of guide to be recognized as a self-employed job, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to win the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without any kind of class or party dogma, I have the ability to pick something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get on.
I don't care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I will always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or SDG, and I will also be against bad ideas.
You're kidding when people call you a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he's saying?
When you create a business plan for your company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There are those who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world or known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of Parliament, he's left with nothing but slogans.
And with that, he cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to get them on my side to get it done.
If elected president, I would have no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate because they don't want to.
If there's a strong character that points out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I assert that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I seek allies.
I'm just getting started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support for my program as I can.
I'm trying to get things done myself, but if it doesn't work out, in six years I'll quit and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've been visiting a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light fraud with light heating oils.
I came in on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did, voted for the establishment representatives.
We're two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the senate, so it's going to be tricky to get change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have the time to do it, to check the impeccable background of every potential party member, nor do I have the money.
I don't have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You have no money?
You're talking about property declarations, how's yours?
It's my private property at about 60 million.
I have a land in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth one million, and I have a couple of million in the account.
I have an Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my childhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was kind to women, and at the same time fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is worth $60 million, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money into it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my show.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I'm getting in salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to continue your business to make a living?
Didn't you say earlier that you were going to leave this business?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I've partially stopped my activities.
For example, the representative from my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring.
People would want the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much do you usually earn as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep earning.
If I were president, then I'd quit the business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there is something interesting to see at last", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Besides, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody just walks into these old-fashioned libraries, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town on the outskirts of Rotterdam hardly worth a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having set a record that will be forgotten.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, it was decided some years ago to make a contribution to the general culture by copying the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the politicians decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for buildings that are both funny and cynical, took up the subject with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around in bewilderment and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called 'Une Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment and condominium buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
True, there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true space and reading lovers do not use it, preferring instead to merge with its topography at each step of their climb to the summit.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the floors of brickwork and the elegant lanterns support the public status of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Looking up, you can see the park benches, the dogs, and the boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"The bookshelves are usually arranged along the facade, and in the center is a huge dark room, which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
What we've done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that simultaneously serve as wall cladding, parapet and rail.
The sight, the touch, the smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unfamiliar material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And so one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have used a few millimetres thick plastic woven fabric as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to four-centimeter-thick sheets.
With heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells like a mix of new car and sneakers.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but with its large glazed surfaces, this building is an example of ecological design", says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences that run transversally across the glass façade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
The library has also been visited by Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who describes the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This is intended to fill, for the time being, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has sunk deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a great success in this queen discipline which in the specialized jargon is known as "creation of an identity".
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a more leading role'
Germany abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather precarious diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories UN observer state status.
However, Berlin ultimately abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that binds the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Do you find it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because it is currently re-orienting its foreign policy away from a US-led policy, so to speak, and towards a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already started on the road towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a 'normal' foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is to say, by exports and by relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and Germany must therefore protect their interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
It must therefore be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't put too much stock in it, because it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining in important decisions like the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position has a very high degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has earned a certain respect.
In the end, all this has done is to show that it is a country which is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it's obvious that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I think the real difference of opinion is not really as big as it is claimed to be.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
So they have no possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet got used to it, it is always a bit awkward and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany takes the lead, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The US influence in European politics is declining, but the EU is not filling the gap yet, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it distasteful or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponyms do not sue.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be proved right.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my desk.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he stores seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are the world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature: at the behest of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or "Bringing Mark".
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" for a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's bad for business, we have to fight it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is losing its grip, the monopoly position is disappearing and the damage to the image is enormous".
The financial losses and the legal costs of the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market in the world, with a volume of €15 billion a year.
However, the annulment of dubious registrations in the trade mark register is complicated and expensive.
The proceedings can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases where the court dismissed a claim because so much time had passed that the name in question had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plagiarist's brand in China", Pattloch notes.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases involve graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer Geely initially used a blue and white logo that was very similar to BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trade mark office in Beijing acknowledges that they have had difficulties in 2010 due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency labour situation returned to normal".
The number of complaint cases pending has thus been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this is costing a lot of money.
As is often the case in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed as rights.
Put another way, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg demonstrates.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese copycat in court.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The impersonator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We have brought this situation on ourselves because in Germany surnames are not protected", says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the Munich court.
Freudenberg was vindicated in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the matter favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "six-figure sum in euros" in an attempt to reach an amicable settlement, but he was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care", Wentzler notes.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten to affect even Europe,
The Commission has not yet taken any decision on the matter.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products in Germany.
The group has long since left this commercial sphere, but it has nevertheless managed to prevent the inscription.
"You have to be very careful", Wentzler says.
Both he and Mr Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register everything that can be protected in China as well", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject may prove to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question, they'd drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, sing and help each other
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir is rehearsing and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are rejoicing
The story of a bond capable of crossing far more than 5,000 miles.
First, the dancing begins: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes, and moccasins search for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor, and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, entangling, and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to go almost out of his boxes as he tries to bring order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Also in attendance are the 50 singers, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice in the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, there are some 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
Over 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school tuition, the uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "story-writer" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak fluent this Bantu language, but they can sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud-and-straw huts, a large proportion of them children.
More than 300 have lost parents to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what is happening in Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Circumcision is frowned upon by the population, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their early 30's has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw most of all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and education.
Without a degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
In the beginning, it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since then professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Sickles and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute takes as its basis that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus), and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital sores, urinary discomfort, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one protect himself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical checkups, especially if you change sex partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir collects for its performances all over Germany, they raise quite a bit of money.
"We have already sent a total of about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself a self-assured and leadership-minded woman manages the money sent from Germany.
She takes care that the orphans find a good place to stay, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of these have up to 14 orphans in their care, provide them with a roof to live on, and see to it that the children attend school each day on time and in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has made it possible for many of the villagers to undergo HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not often spoken about openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his lavish lifestyle, full of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it's also because of the countless temporary workers who travel the country and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms are available on every street corner, but they are hardly used.
It's a different culture, they only accept skin-to-skin contact".
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years across southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - such recognition not only brings a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to bring a few tears to some rabid border soldier.
The journey always leads them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there is a light", say the locals.
And after traveling the 8,000 miles straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal halls of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the pace, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
The first time the moon was discovered, it was a new planet.
The MESSENGER probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, it also has icy water, as three studies published Thursday in the journal Science show.
The MESSENGER probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the part of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
This one appears to be at least a foot long and probably up to 65 feet thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's lead researcher, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images back to Earth, little windows into the vastness of space.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unflatteringly named W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This dazzling image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of material that the star spits out in its dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
This is a picture of the galactic star-forming zone taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the Seven Sisters, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular colorful.
This budding star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings - how they originated remains one of astronomy's great mysteries.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Triphid comes from the Latin word trifidus, meaning "three", because dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming region into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are pounding into each other and colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the dust particles you might find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers speculate that it formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Window on the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and the images they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
It allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the island of La Palma is enormous - the mirror alone is 33 feet [10.4 m] in diameter.
The mirror at the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 35 feet [11 m].
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 1,000 feet.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone with a computer can help by contributing processing power.
View from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It's not expected to be able to take images until 2018.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with the Keck telescopes, surveys the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
A new telescope of enormous proportions is planned for Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of 100 feet [30 m].
This is a picture of what it would be like.
Yet, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
But there is no hard evidence, since the MESSENGER probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is so.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching the age of biblical maturity.

In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach the Biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A footprint search in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The drive through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus thunders through the winding road that passes beside wooded hills, fast-flowing rivers, and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the Talyshi, a people of whom little is known, except that they perfectly master Persian and Azeri and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly ever get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 200 miles [323 km] that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys from the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will hold the Festival of the World's Oldest People", Fatulayeva says.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place who have surpassed 100 years of age.
This is my grandfather, who lived to be 120 years old.
One of his sons died at the age of 136 years.
The undisputed star of the museum, however, is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of M?
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, apparently still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very old people", says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially since there is no civil registry either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talishis.
The museum's director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he's relatively young for what's being worn in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge vat of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Also jumping from side to side are two small children.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, served in typical, domed cups.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and the bottom of the handkerchief hides two long strands of dark blond hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it's never fallen off and it's kept its colour.
"I have never used shampoo either", says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been to a supermarket in my life.
So you're talking about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period after the Second World War.
However, everything came to a head when "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the cult of the father figure of the nation, who rules his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva takes 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "in our culture the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a big family, they're loved, they get all the care they need and they're happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to keep you alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the term "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous divide that the country is in.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no patheticism.
"We must get through the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, so far hopelessly mired in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost begging for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the Constitutional Court's powers and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the rest of the world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
You mean to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were forced by a 100-member constituent assembly of predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean by "beginnings"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway it brings, to impose a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters pertaining to sharia it is obligatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power over all Sunni Islam.
It need not be, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state is to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such a vague formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
It is not a question of anything other than censorship, to be clear.
No article of the Convention explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording prohibiting "offending persons"
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and which according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to defeat the Act before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former International Atomic Energy Agency director Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft constitution should be "in the trash can of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls for a referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him", says opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated", opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For their part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in the rally, shouting: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Morsi "clean up the country", while at the same time proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters didn't want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and those in favour of it would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now the time had come to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamist draft has a guaranteed majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were detained in prison or faced trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'human rights' does not even appear in the new constitution", he laments in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it", laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire on you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control".
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most smelly fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has something to do with its greed for a highly smelly fish?
Take a set of over-cured cheeses.
I put them in the middle of a mountain of wet, dirty football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular, and that ever-present smell is in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As darkness falls and the weather turns colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a shot", says Havard Halvarsen, the city's firefighter who is also known as the "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking large amounts of the drink in one gulp.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk", says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it's not bad; it's not much different from a sushi portion that you've traveled a few miles on a bus.
Rakfisk is a product from a very different era, when poverty plagued Norway and, before refrigeration, fish was stored during the autumn in water and salt in hermetically sealed barrels.
Later, in the dead of winter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactivated by alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is increasing rapidly; over 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and not so long ago richer than Norway, come to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered an important, essential, though rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive, a can of beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10 euros each.
Norway is not usually on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
It is very hard for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, as she passes trays of rakfisk and who, with her long blonde mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, a prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off".
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was spending money they didn't have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And to eat rakfisk", he adds with a laugh.
I'm in the snow lining up to get something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite juicy to savor.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of the many venues that hold a rakfisk dinner where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV station has connected live with a host who wears a bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard".
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls out of a chair, maybe overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a rough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing a huge chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the running of the nation.
You're facing a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal".
Before rubbing shoulders with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as the governor of his home state, Mexico.
A highly populated and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A man of sincerity
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name on the entrance of a modern sports complex and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust him to make real and lasting change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs".
After an uninterrupted 81-year period in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the Los Pinos presidential palace, within the party there are many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's view that the new president lacks substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, a person who knows how to listen".
However, on the other side of the state, that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year the military was called in to help fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a deserted plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in the last two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to his house, it was as if his body had been cleaned", Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared".
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross on which reads a single word: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family says he's been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were a gossipy old woman, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up".
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence", he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he is the same kind of president he was when he was governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet, that is precisely what the families of the Neza City victims fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to address allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison.
The trial centers on Manning's time at the Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors sought to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce the mistreatment he now claims he suffered while in military custody.
During the prosecution's cross-examination of Manning at a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits by unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the defense's request that the case be dismissed given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already been punishment enough, came a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was incarcerated in maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment he received from the guards as "excellent" and the treatment he received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaint of ill-treatment, despite the officers asking Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken of those problems and indicated to him that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems", Manning said.
Judge Army Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she was receiving during a January 2011 meeting with a board charged with examining the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and [I wanted] to be off injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness in the heat.
He said that the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to nothing but Camp Arafjon, to that cage", Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage".
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the cellars couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about the treatment Manning was receiving.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a plea he made in Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell for one night, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's cross-examination on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order the guard gave him that he should drop the blanket he could have been covered with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experiences in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted in the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules applicable to any detainee in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally inducing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If he's found guilty on all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and I was already totally confused.
Some signs pointed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's about ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italian".
Later I settled on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in the foreigners' queue.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda, as it always does when the leaders of these two countries meet, was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was eager to talk also about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he will venture to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a US official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that is really challenging is the relationship that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans that live in the United States.
Are we talking about grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio is that, somewhere along our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked out of the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time, that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, low education, poor village background, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be unclear at times, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexican elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we're some sort of inferior category that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his eyes, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in America but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more about who they are and the latter are annoyed by it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even further, from what I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bad blood.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a great country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be left with this idea, fellas.
It's only fair.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful for the way their relatives were treated a long, long time ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new middle east
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that all hope is in vain.
Amidst the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their long-standing conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces, and Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil, whether they like it or not.
Perhaps this makes their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their lethal stalemate could be unravelled.
A War That Is Neither Lost Nor Won
At first sight, optimism seems very difficult to justify at present.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has been dealt a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and squeezing the 1.7 million people of Gaza into one of the most miserable and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the Hamas cause, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf's richest and most dynamic states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah-military party dominates, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
The growth of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, led by President Muhammad Morsi, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region, especially in the southern flank of Israel.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn't have much time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is Hamas's cousin and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard-liners will come to the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep better... for a while.
On the diplomatic front, the United States is more assertive than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
While rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main chunk of territory aspiring to become a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really governed the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
Better to have them behind that wall and give them a good punch if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, though the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take over in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, in the same way that this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The brutal missions against Gaza every two or three years to repulse Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution is still the one that sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper are advocating: two states and the surrender of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start to curb the flow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state status in the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to give it his full attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases appear on small, pale green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The Australian Tobacco and Generic Packaging Act, a world-first, comes into force, replacing the logos and colours of the brands with a dim olive green wrapper, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies who are sick from being the children of smoking parents.
Except for the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a type of small font.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter youths from smoking by removing the traits that make smoking glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring more tobacco to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that demand for silicone cups and lids to cover up the unpleasant images on the cartons had skyrocketed from almost zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.
Ms Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more stock.
"It's good business for us".
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the target demographic.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has shifted to online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet for local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
"If you're a tobacco marketer and you're left with this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews from "ordinary citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is questionable whether this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is focusing more on what the new regulations imply than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to object to the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have significant trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to make it compulsory to include images in the boxes.
They are now mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"I'm not affected by photographs.
I just don't listen to them".
"You take the cigarette and you put the pack away", Victor El Hage says as he buys a pack with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would stop smoking: my daughter".
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack store in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"I used to take an hour to get a delivery, now I'm late for four", says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we close the store", he says as he raises his hands.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to be a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane we were flying in had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are extolling the benefits of boredom.
They feel that it is all right for us and our children to be bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to seek out interesting options and can encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently hooked up to this or that screen, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in good spirits?
I know.
And they didn't.
But we'll talk about that later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more leisure time, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, argues, it is not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very long", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the first century AD.
We also have to consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a wide variety of ways", says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and pitching the idea to a 100-person panel, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to engage in a fulfilling activity".
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person is not doing something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "distracted attention, associated with low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, whereas people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a television program in the next room at a high volume that was completely unrelated, others listened to it at a low volume that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at all.
The group that listened to the program at the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and they attributed it to boredom.
"When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the distraction can lead to boredom", said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts on a production line, a distracting music can help you not get bored".
"In fact, we now know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as signs of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert".
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to be bored at some point: a delayed plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "boredom tendency scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do them all".
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that by using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more variety.
But in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by means of a search.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest peaks", largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my original question: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or falling into substance abuse as a method of combating it, as research has shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself", says Professor Fenske.
And "that capacity to be measured applies to other situations", he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be overly critical of him either.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable apart from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with me.
"In our view, we need to be bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to be associated with anything worthwhile", he says.
He points out that what people really want is a way to disconnect and enjoy a quiet time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated", he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops".
Colorado: no instruction book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal statewide: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"We are treated like criminals", says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped charging people over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law is in effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have vowed to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still citing individuals.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
The regulators in Washington state are also looking into the matter.
And they are still seeking advice on setting up a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licences - all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to serve as a model", he says.
Washington's law, I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year to swim between two waters, as the state's license system will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on cannabis businesses within a 300-meter radius of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metro area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city attorney would stop prosecuting minor offenses for marijuana possession to people over 21 and that the police would stop charging those offenses "with immediate effect".
Police Chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city's regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to put pressure on consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those faults that at the time they occurred were crimes", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on marijuana legalization.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer issue citations to adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I do not consider it a waste of time to continue enforcing the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the judicial system was never considered to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that are arising across the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district attorneys", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much time taking people to court that they can't really accept that it's legal yet", he said.
By being the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same way as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the nation's test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also eagerly awaiting directions from the federal government, which still envisions the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates are hoping the Justice Department will back down.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana businesses to exist for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug enforcement agents are unlikely to break down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated shops for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level", explained city council member Bob Nicholson.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're studying what the community voted for versus what the state voted for".
Many questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students for their views just now
I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late '80s to pursue a degree in history, I had packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard said that I had dropped out because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink from unopened cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called Enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbarous: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that's all about now.
Well, reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the Conservative Party students is such at Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate student group) at Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously ostracized, personally attacked and treated as undesirables" for their political views.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA) graduate student Joe Cooke in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a staff with the silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated like "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend to the left in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us".
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old and president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This is a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of the members", he says.
For my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than I was at first.
I entered college in September of 1986, a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its height.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when new students meet each other and meet the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the ridicule of conservative college students but participated in it willingly.
The politics of the miners' strike, privatisation and government opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended involved translating 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I didn't say any.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like biscuit dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just plain stupid?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to hold back.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people", Pitt grumbled.
I went back to my room like a soul in mourning.
That night I sat alone at the university dinner; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it is.
They're messing with anyone they suspect is Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's even worse for you.
Many new Tories pretend to be Labour".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to date like-minded people only after dark?
Should I become a worker and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only a Conservative, but also Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was just over there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he said.
I began to commute daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan relatives and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was a student there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", she said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude".
Her painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for fun.
It would break my heart if you left".
Exhausted by so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who was also a supporter of the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The next week, during a seminar in which another history professor had insinuated, in all seriousness, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford university career.
My father wrote two weekly columns for Murdoch's newspaper at the time.
My door was locked.
I was inside, cowering in fear, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You might call me a weak, whiny woman.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only produced 14 Conservative Prime Ministers but which today hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the Seam", which opened this week in London, ABC is speaking with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apoteosis that brings together more than 130 dresses of haute couture created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which is open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most granate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble modest from the northern Italian town of Voghera to the idol of the international "jet-set".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't blow their cock out of your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino, is the first woman to wear a Valentino.
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his flat.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decor, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved", recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", he concludes.
Parade of the Alcurnia
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of love-reciprocated love.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-foot-long catwalk that proposes a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to gaze at a dreamy "audience" sporting masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as Sibyl of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashionista, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty", adds the former duchess of Feria.
I love the colors you use, they're bright and they're "giving" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't even remember the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of his nightgowns...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit with a skirt of pinks, draped corsage and a badge of honor.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her wedding dresses from the fashion designer with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's bridal gown at her wedding to Pablo of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstresses) were needed to make that ivory-colored silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, a leading authority on the fashion industry, the dress represents a milestone in late-century couture, "the return of the high society clientele".
For years, he was obscured by the elite's savoir-être, and now Valentino is their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance", D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him".
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur across steep stone paths
There are people for whom their job is hell and others who literally work in hell.
Anto Wijaya is one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must descend daily to the bottom of its crater, where sulphuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies upon contact with air.
After picking up large stones of sulfur, weighing a total of about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets over his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only about 800 feet [250 m] to the top of the volcano, which rises to 8,000 feet [2,386 m], but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb in a turtle-like pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that any slip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners at Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once on top, they cut their way through the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 6,500 feet [1,850 m].
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"We normally carry 70 kilos, so each trip costs us about R46,000", explains Anto, who usually carries three items a day.
It takes three hours on each and ends up ground, but they allow him to collect 138,000 rupees (£8.25) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhumane effort, it's triple what I'd make in the country.
"The daily wage for the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (US$1.50) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (US$167)", explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the price was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as compelling as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
He has severe asthma, difficulty breathing, constant coughing and irritation of the eyes from toxic fumes.
At 27 years old, Anto has been playing hide and seek for three years in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to pay off despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, difficulty breathing, constant coughing, and irritation of the eyes from the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price you must pay to achieve your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur keeps pouring in at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminated by a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets over their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur extraction to save costs nor supplies any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at the same weight.
In fact, they do not even see the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera fee that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for beasts and not for people", protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old stocky porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throats and scratches the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of suffering from serious illnesses - beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain, and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at age 53.
Each day, he and his companions haul 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 11 miles [18 km] away, along a goat path through the brush.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life", proclaims Unainik, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (chicken) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
This is purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt like this was an issue that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, like throwing pheromone perfumes or speed-dating parties.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to write a rap song?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax breaks.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness, and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are rife with thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to keep so many small houses from being built.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The city development authority has taken over control of the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who previously faced obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards raising the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the central business district it seems like they won't have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, houses are expensive, education is expensive, so a lot of people are putting it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But I'm good with my own money and time", says another youth in his 20's.
Men and women cite their career, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the final say.
Offline is private, online is private.
It's called privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of private or "the area of private life that has the right to be protected from any intrusion".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing on the Internet situations that you would surely not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys aged between ten and 15 years, who are frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "password and username", when applying it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't post", says ten-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone", she says.
I put up some nice pictures on my FB page or I play games.
I also entertain my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't of me, or someone who was making a fool of themselves", she says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene, nude photographs, or graphic crime or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother's in, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly", she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who'd recommend you to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example", he says.
According to the boy, no one has ever insinuated himself or asked for his home address or telephone number.
"If I am pressured or demanded, I simply remove them from my account", he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine's acquaintance was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"She never knew who she was", he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
"Just put him in privacy".
It then explains a series of steps to configure the account securely.
Unlike George, this kid would upload photos of people he knew in awkward or embarrassing situations.
I would if I was wrong or wanted to.
"I know that's cyberbullying, though", he says.
Key questions to be asked
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed", she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in education from Yale University and author of the book Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are those children and youth who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning", he says.
He says the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a clear-cut criterion about what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age when maturity is not for it".
"They also need to be selective when their main concern is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", he adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a picture of you posted like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what the others are posting about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people's permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every second?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Offline, one acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social networks", he says.
The surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks.
Understanding each of the points will give parents a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or post", he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "not talking to strangers".
Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency said at the beginning that they were going to hand it over after the closure, but later said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Access to information on the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of Unasur attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the information gathering to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today", said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts", added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had accepted to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midday in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were fixed for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He informed that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the internet at a low price in all corners of South America, and to address jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples", added Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully deal with the maritime dispute after a CIJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they are scheduled to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the interim presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also favoured the re-composition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José human rights pact.
The professors never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States", he said in reference to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because it did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange had been extradited to a third country and that his process was not being respected".
He also criticised the Swedish justice for demanding that he be interrogated in his territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there is a risk of deteriorating Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian president.
What is, however, is the danger of physical and mental health deterioration because of being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a safe passage that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances", he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives safe passage tomorrow, this is over".
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists in the name of profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In that respect, he congratulated the fact that it is no longer these journalists "or the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that if reelected "he will deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état cloaked in legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That ruling is not being followed at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept a ruling no matter how tough it is".
Referring to the possibility of running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
I've never been interested in power personally, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it'll be my last term in office and we'll be out of public life.
We lose even.
"It's a decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to spend the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed as AIDS positive.
"It was like a bomb fell on me", she says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "smoother", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness himself and began to learn about it; with such a commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
She is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which she arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was much doubt, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of a clinic at the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was wearing a haircut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It's now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
Yet, many people, unaware of their illness, still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the first reported cases of AIDS in the world, "the great achievement means that at this moment the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information that was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system damage that patients have at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that anyone who is diagnosed HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while in control, can live without problems until the age of 75", the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been reported so far this year; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been available since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we haven't had a shortage of medicine. The problem is that patients arrive too late because they don't know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong figure: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what you have to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, you have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all the people who need it".
Specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory to get tested, motivated only by a friend who had done so, and despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better blow myself three times a week", they say no in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat right, I exercise, I take the medication.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I am responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Get tested, if you were at risk, the sooner you know you're HIV positive, the better, and if you're diagnosed, learn that you can live like anyone else, be responsible.
That, your message, sums up the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Tapatá who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom", he said.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with the grief and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, the communicator said.
He proposed to redirect this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and that these 100 are found in public bathroom dispatchers in the places frequented by young people.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would be condoms distributed in his Administration.
"Sexuality is not like that, it's better to bring condoms to those who already have sexual activity", he said.
The Key In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 for AIDS and 1,317 for HIV).
The state is 4th nationally in new and accumulated AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because for every registered case, there are four to five people who don't know it.
Ratified by a United States court of appeals a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved via a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the survival guarantee procedures of the firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the backlash to the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizing their properties on the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case notes that the creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy processed in Mexico.
The first point would mean ignoring international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, the debts of Vitro's subsidiaries to their parent companies being recognised in the critical mass of the commercial tender, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case where the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Contracts.
What is certain, moreover, is that, subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the US courts, that is to say the "butterfly" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this.
From another angle, this one blames Vitro for the difficult situation it faced from 2008 onwards, apart from the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country with the batons.
For now, the González Sada family will file a motion for reconsideration with the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full court, that is, the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Mercantile Contests, noting that it was discharged with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match this with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-way carom: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
The balance sheet
Dormant for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of Aviators Pilots already found the bottleneck.
The institution headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, who is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to the complaint, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The funds would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at a forum at the University of the Caribbean over the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution centre for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast zone to oppose the monumental thing that devastated part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the stakes against the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has sought a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball world champion Hector "Hetin" Reyes was associated with the sport of the small-field board for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And that is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, be it as a minor league player, a National High School Basketball player, an attorney and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s", Reyes recalled during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with more emotion are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years as co-owner or owner of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as proxy, co-proxy or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, and he was a great administrator", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told me, "I got you a good, strong player, 6'7".
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already listed as a federative mandamás.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and would have been bronze if it hadn't been for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup group is the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, like the one who beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fur coat that was quite similar to the one we won in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that maybe wasn't the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the one from the Pre-Olympics in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the mess of the Panamerican of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the forecasts.
Who's been the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was definitely Little Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his track record in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a tough one.
We've had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to have implemented, like the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now, kids are traveling and playing too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the mandatory certifications and course for executives, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
Most of what I do is listen to music, watch old music videos on YouTube, enjoy my grandkids and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the "Dallas" production company.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"She was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman made his name on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets a beautiful genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically well-received roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious J.R. that brought Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
It also helped give the show a ratings record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 finale of "MASH" which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others had reason to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed to a mental institution.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Friday that Hagman was "big, on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us, who had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
He had already finished filming five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate comment from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met and married the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became an advocate for organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them value, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but you're going to be okay".
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Begin a course exploring the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar on December 21, which many have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "re-Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we're 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those of an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering classes on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, associate professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic-themed movies and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We didn't add '2012' to always have the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours", said Restall of his high-school course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails for weeks and weeks before the semester started, from people asking if there was still a place.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And that is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student majoring in psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - much less a teacher - said they believed in the December 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we kind of debunked it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of this speculation.
"Other places people don't think about this", he said.
In the English-speaking world mostly.
Joseph Dougherty, a La Salle University professor of religion who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew of any courses on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment have been spoken of, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think of the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to parties "at the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends and we'll laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
