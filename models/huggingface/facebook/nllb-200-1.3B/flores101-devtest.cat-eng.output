USA Gymnastics supports the charter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by significant advances within the organization, rather than withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify how an abuse, of the proportions so courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could have gone unnoticed for so long, and adopts the necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an adviser to John F. Kennedy, and later in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but offers details that fossils normally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish brown at the top with a light or carotenoid background.
The find also offers a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed canon, called a scythe, but do have other features of feathers - beards and barbels - the researchers deduce that scythe was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for regulating temperature or for displaying themselves.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office says that nine of the injured were police officers.
Police have said they suspect a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant is responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operated under the same basic principles as other stars: It was seen that the activity of all the stars in the system depended on their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used simultaneously to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic inversions.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

The government has also pledged many millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Vaccine delivery forecasts in the historically worst affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and low priority over other diseases.

The infrared images show us variations in temperature day and night, which shows that they're probably caves.
They are colder than the surface around them during the day, and hotter at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep clots in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University astrogeology team located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put inside an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After the voter's identity is verified by the officials, the voter drops the envelope into the urn and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the procedure.

The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was re-admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Scottish Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be dismissed because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not make any further statements, at least, until the verdict.
The leaked document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Among the other issues discussed, it is reported, are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA only commits to accept it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot test had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the pilot test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Association hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Director with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation receive proper safety training and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunctioning and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "frankly unfortunate".
The earthquake hits Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management has said there have been no reports of damage to the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami signals.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage to hijack his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages have recently been released, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during her spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black-headed' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the second moon. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Moona was as freaky as I...maybe even more...I love her and will meet her at the altar...hope she finds a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the poll's extreme, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question due to his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication needed to deal with his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He headlined the rumors as "political turmoil and downpour".
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older technology based on ground-based radars because traffic controllers locate pilots with much greater precision and send them more accurate information.
No reinforcement of transport is envisaged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; on foot there are also no car parks or connecting parking lots.
Concern over a lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the match will be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought to take much longer for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Galápagos conifer finch, Geospiza conirostris (outside).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into the smallest of shapes.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be pounded or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on other metals, and it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance, and you can make a marker for it using the sap of the columbus.
The colour of collard greens changes depending on whether the substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the analyzed substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with your clean, wet hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewerage have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, the baths were part of public baths where men and women gathered in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the most remarkable thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has made transportation much faster and easier.
It has brought us by train, by car, and by many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wild domestic cats) that eat the smaller prey that is far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, locusts, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
Herds are made up of one to three related adult males along with up to 30 females and pups.
Females are often closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave largely like dog herds or wolf herds, which are animals with a behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (though not to other large felines) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the force of a forced human.
The tiger is the only one of the four felines that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voice roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase shouted out of words of boredom.
Birds like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) with their sense of smell, summing up the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The birds hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then overrunning their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the original main group (for example, crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island and unable to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the formation of new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had over seventy teeth that were squeezed like knives, accompanied by an additional play in the roof of the mouth, so that there was no escape for anything that got in their way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, long-finned fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual items at their banquets, such as spiders, peacocks, roaches, and a rodent called the liron.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they would curl up while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
So for example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a roasted chicken.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only the priests could access.
Special pyramids in the form of towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters overlooking the street; the stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, on his journey west, discovered Greenland and named it.
Now, despite their discovery, there were Eskimo tribes already living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, they wrote a treasure map.
Now, that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to store it.
So it seems that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by "Vichy France", which was Frenchmen who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting the 'shi.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Drac".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations properly so called.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or national judiciary, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often abstained.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skating and F1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and count on the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipel".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Formosa Island, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began transforming indigenous grain production practices and using Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital imaging camera sensors.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period European history questioned the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for that reason.
The church had been the principal authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering complete segments of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical eras: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who requested it allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the army's statements on classes, from that point on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people of the repressed working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a rather vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even knowing it exists, it's not that easy to find.
There is nothing to see but a serene, beautiful sky above the head, and the abundant mountains that surround it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the wives and members of the Pharaoh's family.
The "upside down" sign resembles the letter V (see below) and the "downside down" sign looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it's upward it means you start at the tip and push the bow upward, and when it's downward it means you start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downward.
Rubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a louder, assertive sound.
Feel free to write down your own directions, but keep in mind that the bow marks are there for a musical purpose, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and wailing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to bring the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles to the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, thus paying for much of the expense and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is popularly known as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide network of roads for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until about 1100 CE.
Their status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Croats had returned with gifts such as seals and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, and because of the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the West with 25 to 30 years of delay.
And towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence farming is one that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most peasants were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The wild child, when raised only by nonhuman animals, presents behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the basics go a step further.
The bastide theory is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals who undergo a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The scraps can be virtual or real: put another way, a teacher is a form of scraps, but so is the little clip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual bastides are built into the software and are designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are taken in for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where he or she is not fed, loved and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our host system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The welcome is supposed to confer all the needs that were not covered in the house from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected if a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that these interpretative abilities of human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variation heritage that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the back and forth variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences - declining growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would be the proteins that leaves and legumes provide us, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult for primates like us humans to digest.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savannah chimps do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a low-noise alarm clock that makes you conscious but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you're the kind of person who resets the clock while you're sleeping, try putting it on the other end of the room, so you have to take it to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, so one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Anyone can reach enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but spread through the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It's about kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga is the awakening of kundalini energy (illuminated energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which made it easier for the Soviet Union and the United States to collaborate. With the armistice came the climax of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next forty years and was fought in real combat, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defenses had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Contemporary German naval forces, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily dispose of milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were often kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasturelands, often guarded by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they were used by horse-drawn wagons to achieve greater speeds and to carry larger loads in the more difficult parts.
The railings were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, however, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron roof over them.
This became common practice, but the iron further worn out the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first fully iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Biped specializations have been found in fossil austropithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes may have walked on two legs at any stretch 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that might exist in the future.
This only works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many shots of the birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and fangs, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur would.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with the swallows, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both redoublades and shrimps are nesting, adapted to being seen in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
ME is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most of the scientific research.
Now, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all subjects of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural villages to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this enormous economy of coal has triggered one of the most stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Transit Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) fullness, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the Spidemon and the Ephemer.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
There were people who thought what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving toward the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
There is knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although in addition, according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
One may also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All of the universe is made up of matter, all of the matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms would fit into the endpoint of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never needing a pointing machine.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon up the coast, but splitting the core back releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break up with a small or zero collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark measures 70 km in thickness at its nearest part and 100 km at its farthest part.
It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar mares on the visible face because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for lava to escape to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can appear so that managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to follow as "another guy" (or girl).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a fight between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of a virtual group usually function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member addresses. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organisation? One of the objectives for implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the customer's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. So it narrows the research area down and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of damage, trauma, injury, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various home computer applications and video games.
Theme trips are an important part of any class, and often a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual journey is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with prospective students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, each year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a memoir.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this often changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "compel students to be smarter about the world around them".[24] The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of which others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the quintessential Canadian city.
The population of the great northern extensions is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of populations, it's often surprising: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it made a great way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route in India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be chased, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural or otherwise, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerians used it as a strategic port, which led by the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, terrissa, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be wise to investigate before making any visit outside of that city to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
She was one of the main stops during the special program "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than non-African air.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one witnessing diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee is charged.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been related to a bright bar graph that is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon Waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists occupied, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stops of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/swampland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tiger hawks.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a drawbridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 metres. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs are expected to be in place.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is today eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of native indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
There are also tournaments and smaller matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas pound (FKP), with a fixed value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted.
On outlying islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they may accept British and American currency; check with landlords in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you have to do it by going away.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the sensation colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less unchanging throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards per meter away from bones and wolves and 25 yards per meter from other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, wasps, ants, bones and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bones and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insurrection in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Beaches are abundant, as Auckland is a stone's throw from two harbours.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) overlook the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbour, the expensive neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes full family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
You can drink a lot of French wines, but New Zealand and Australia wines don't quite tolerate travel.
It's perfectly safe to drink local tap water, but if you're scared, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of cut is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate bar meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Yet, he follows the advice of the authorities, observes all signs, and pays close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozoos are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and shy away.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep you booked if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp out there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're gonna have to get there early to get a camping spot close to the music.
It should be remembered that even though the music has ended on the main stages there may be sections of the festival that continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice creates a terrible noise in the most affected.
Passenger cruises in St. Petersburg include a time in the city.
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend, often without windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to cheer guests up and keep them from leaving the establishment.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages inside the house, but drunkenness alters judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Drivers in high latitudes or in mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive like you're on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be seen to be reduced by snow falling or being displaced by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the journey over land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and that is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "rural walking", "excursion safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the extension was announced, you could be in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical entry for about ¥7,000.
In many hotels, you can ask for a plank and an iron table, even if there is none in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to wear ironing socks, then you may consider using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to overheat (it may shrink or, in extreme cases, become sticky).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, it takes a few minutes.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of forcibly injuring or killing people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers bound to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful - steep slopes, narrow sections, and tight curves are the norm.
The speed limits indicated are notably lower than those of other front and rear sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although it is curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good and Bavarian pastry is very, very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Fruit pastes are common, with apples cooked inside the pastes all year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits.
If you want small but tasty pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is easy to find throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of spicy dishes in a simple way.
The straps are supported by the feet of the genus which hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the genome, but may present safety problems because the genome's feet could get caught in them.
If a mare jumps from a horse but has one foot stuck in the saddle, it could be dragged if the horse runs away.
To begin with, most jeans wear riding boots with a heel and a single toe and heel.
In addition, some seats, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the leather strap to fall off the seat if a saddle pulls it back when falling.
The Cochamón Valley: the most prominent climbing destination in Chile, also called the Yosemite of South America, has many large granite walls and cliff-segments.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are continually making new routes through its endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snow surfing, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered slopes down the coast with a pair of skis or a surfboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", planning their entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was in 1861 that Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Traveling with a backpack on skis: this activity is also called rural skiing, ski tourism or ski excursionism.
It is related to, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on rough terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat longer distances than by walking - although you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack on flat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to re-pass passport control.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa does not mean that you need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Craft products may be classified as antiques, although they are more recent than other similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami and the culture surrounding marketing is also important for many with other crafts.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sami have been associated with large-scale reindeer farming, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mostly as game animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a traffic alert, your travel insurance or cancellation may be affected.

The considerations presented are usually brief, general and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, major social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur around the world, and there are different classes that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, squalls, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, waterfalls, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers be aware of any risk of adverse weather affecting their area as it could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should take a course in professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the problems that have been treated here in greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid and, sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex-change surgery in another country should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where the gender (X) is not specified or updated documents to show the desired name or gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.
Security checkpoints have also become far more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not be expected to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Hanging currents are the flow that returns after waves hit the beach, often a cliff or similar.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can form there toward deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue in trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
So good a point of exit from the stream, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills or if you've been told, you might want to wait for a ransom.
The return shock comes before the culture shock (with a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture often find it particularly difficult to adjust to their native culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Sometimes it is not expected that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
The story of sound and light is quite a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes in the story are shown on the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, broken by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no phone coverage, satellite phone service may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is commonly used on vessels, including recreational craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among people who consider a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among undergraduates, giving them the option to take a year off before starting college, without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a sabbatical year abroad can often improve your chances of starting higher education again in your home country.
Typically there will be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an important shipping destination, and the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to the archipelago and lakes.
While any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sport sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is equalled by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is equally special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruisers make an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of whole days returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you do not need any independent visa (dated 2009).
Some cruise ships show Berlin, Germany, on their flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is no cause for shame: it is no different from the personal fears and apprehensions that many people express about other things.
For some, knowing how an airplane operates and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If you're airlifting your goods, there are routes to unload them, and it can take days to get through customs.
The only way to send it faster was to do it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow you to send baggage without a passenger to carry it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good deal of money for that privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: normally, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times in first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is in common use.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which enjoys its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and congregated commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide promenades, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace and the old mosques and churches, though the city exudes a more Mediterranean-European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Don't spoil the place by painting or engraving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Castilian. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Now, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the official language of priority.

Regular messages in the metro are only in Catalan, but unforeseen interruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to behave in Paris is to behave as best you can, to act like someone who is "well-bred" (well-educated).
The sudden appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, with beech, peach and hazel trees, and is home to a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It enjoys a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
It is home to livestock such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, mussels, lynx, wild cat, and rooster, along with many more common species.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets to women who are not dressed, but if you wear your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
This piece can also be ordered at the entrance, but it is a garment that is not rented after each use, so you may find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is the Pa con olio: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available seasoning such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word for you, always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.

It can be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is a bit complicated because you have to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a substantive way.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.

The pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational places.
Since light pollution was not a problem at the time, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those currently built.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an action known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

There's a tradition of spending Easter night doing the vigil somewhere in the open sky to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a spring and fertility ritual that predates Christianity.
The most traditional churches often hold a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin the celebrations at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying or surfing.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from traveling there, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the first pasture animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun never rises over the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will remain dark virtually all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is not usually a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
Clothes are the standard clothing of the business, and coworkers are named by their surnames or job titles.
