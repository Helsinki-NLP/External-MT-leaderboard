This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had the rhinoceros, a very widespread theory already, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
.Scientists claim that the animal's tail was a cast-coloured canine at the top and bottom is clear or carotenoid in colour.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of the rays in birds.
Because dinosaur rays do not have well-developed scales, called rachis, but have other characteristics of rays  barbs and barbules researchers have deduced that rachis was most likely an evolutionary development that took place after these other characteristics.
The structure of the beak suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the dental of a small dinosaur, the sample shows an adult beak and not a thin, soft beak of the young.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the jaw of a young age dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the skin of a felus.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process.In the evening, votes are counted by a volunteer under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be affected because a photograph of her has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other towns in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves in danger if they publish pictures etc. of suspected persons".
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least before the prosecution.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered topics reported including the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The Commission also concluded that the measures provided for in this Decision were inadequate to prevent the spread of the disease in the Union.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association (Sporting Shooters Association) hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly sworn in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Some 60 cases of overheating-damaged iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it had been informed of 27 apparatus-related incidents.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple 'truly regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that there were no reported injuries in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that there was no indication of Tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolandoza shot his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed to use a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that administering hormone would speed up the maturing of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' that are flight recorders.
Her fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two corners. Really unique like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me... maybe even more than me... I love her and touch her... hoping she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that she believes Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 per cent of those surveyed agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relay events, but due to his complaints there were doubts about his health status.
He couldn't take the medications needed for his pain as they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water supply to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the mistakes as "political words and stupidity".
It is speculated that he will present a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ancient ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and give bots more precise information.
No overhead transport is being placed and the land trains will not stop at Wembley, and the car park and the land park-and-ride facilities are not available.
Fears of a lack of transport have raised the possibility that the game will be forced to be played with the doors closed without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science provided a report on the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made in any kind of shape. It can be rolled in small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can then be twisted and ground. It can be marbled or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the design of hand-printed images in books called "rolled manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cashew oil.
The juice of the cabbage changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two babies dry together and then, with clean, wet hands, put them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of skin.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had to have a sewer in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Waste of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, ancient Persia, and ancient China, the towels were also used. In Roman civilization, towels were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and subsequently reflects it downward, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that bicycles have done for us is that they have made transportation easier and faster.
He brought the train, the car, and many other means of transportation with him.
Among them there are more medium-sized cats that eat the medium-sized price ranging from snails to antelopes and slugs.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, geese and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a breed, a special task that every cat has and that does not allow them to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called prides in English.
The groups (prides) are composed of one to three related adult males, plus a maximum of thirty females and males.
Women are generally closely related to each other, as they are a large family of siblings and daughters.
Ion groups act like groups of puppies or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good athlete in general, the tiger can jump (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's loud voice, but rather like a sentence of coyly worn words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch lizards, reptiles, reptiles, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that the ocelot catches are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) with the smell, keeping the land where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move around with friends, too.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as moving over a mountain or river range, or moving to a new island so that they cannot move back easily) they often find themselves in a different environment from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, still needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be able to call themselves the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide for humans to exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mossaurus was the top predator of his day, so he was afraid of nothing but other mossaurs.
Her long wings were filled with over 70 very cutting teeth, as well as another set of years with the roof of her roof, meaning that anyone who came her way had no chance of escaping.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a tongue splintered in two, and his diet included poultry, large fish, other fish, and may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, donkey, beetle, and a type of sleeping rat-like rodent.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men enjoyed having a meal together where they grinned on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman food could not include food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, blood, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a donkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard inside the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the goddess.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were simply open counters across the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of what he discovered, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text appears at the bottom of the document, headed down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing of D-Day and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south remained still not free.
It was led by the French "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in a way also defines the size of society.
Cities that are states are the precursors of nations.Civilization culture involves the transfer of knowledge from different generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a just dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, of which the Congress was the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
It had no power to overcome the interstate tax and tariff laws.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all States before they could be amended and the States took the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, make Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the size/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipel'.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the Taiwan Valley, and began a transformation in the practices of producing native wheat and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Dedged Room.
Much of the buildings at the end of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed-image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been achieved by the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is currently somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the most simple integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family) are equal to or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The highly abused and often re-used third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of image order.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that cross the third image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become a lord and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common rabbi.
One of the key Christian principles is that good should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money funds are specifically there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the cessation of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain damaged international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the ocean, thus creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Germany has not yet been able to provide any information on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent a similar situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each stage of China and each powerful family were distinctive dynasties.
Also between each dynasty was a period of instability with the provinces divided, the most well-known of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of Ancient China where thousands of humans died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being class-based, army ranks were now caliber-based.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other people of the repressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He frequently made a cave known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find anything even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around it, and little of this world can be seen or heard from the depths.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "the Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Dead Forest contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest among them), several small crypts, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's women and family members.
The 'top-down' mark looks like a V and the 'bottom-down' mark looks like a steeple or square shape without the bottom.
'L above means that you start at the tip and push the force, and below means that you start at the groove (the place where your hand holds the force) and pull the force.
The upper strings of a stringed instrument generate a softer sound, while the lower strings are louder and more assertive.
You can make any marks you want with the lapis, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two sons (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, the rebellious Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by crowds of people who were raving and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their car windows open.
At one time a member of the crowd was beating the head of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles before the deposed Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay the bulk of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
The overprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute, of course, the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events occurred was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged cars.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals and, over time, habits and culture related to that geography resulted, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Western Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status worsened during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than those offered by Byzantine markets.
During this time the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
First, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels are slow moving, Western styles can be traced back 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to pull clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system, which uses native, ecoregional, fertile seeds together with crop rotation or other techniques that are relatively simple to maximise yield.
Historically many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their partnership using a different and symbolic style, which includes ways, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, invention or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children have been abducted by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the children was due to the parents' rejection of the children's serious intellectual or physical weakness.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been bred by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully bred by non-human animals, wild game exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular animals it has taken care of, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Escaffolding is not a learning method but rather help providing support to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little clip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to query, facilitate, and explain procedures that could have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from negligence, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, sponsors who offer their love, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care should provide all the needs that were missing in the previously taken from the home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, learning and socialization have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, surface movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The Presidents Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the option removes it from the expression variation collection.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation l here and there between the two groups with per generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as that of humans to meet its ammonium acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: decreased growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (eat, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, it is no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of getting up specifically during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using relatively quiet detectors that bring you to your senses without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, and it makes you get out of bed to get up.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (in particular water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, thereby causing the person to wake up to pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of present life is.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were enriched by the path of love of the mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (light energy) is raised through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of God. Through the visualization of several gods one cleans the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an enlightenment consciousness.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Just two years after the war ended, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real, alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already divided, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize itself along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became almost obsolete by now, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the borders of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the regions of eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic sheep were generally kept on walks adjacent to the hills or other pasture areas, and were often attended by sheep herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull loads greater than on the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
Cross-tracks were introduced rather early to keep track in place, however, gradually it became realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused further wear on the wooden cartridge wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking standing two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning standing man) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialisations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Nevertheless, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the source of the problems, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on 4 July, the handwritten draft and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the lobby of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered a reading of it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today.
Many people do not view them as dinosaurs because they have fins and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have shallow legs and pointed fins, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately.Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that no immediate diagnosis can be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient family of Baccas, which are highly adapted insects as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nocturnal, adapted to live in the home or in the place of their host.
Around the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or the best interest of their child, to have a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and experiment is a text used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oxillants that will continue a period of free-range cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by marking either DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the microbial line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit atural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's small towns by car to go to work and are joined by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is, in some way, linked to, and supports, a private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be represented approximately mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to hunt, their ability to hunt helps them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to twist their wings back in place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot return their wings are the mazzarella and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System walked around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, for the Earth does not feel moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the World, at some points it is six miles wide.
In all, the Amazon accounts for 20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marveling at the monuments of their predecessors who, at the time, were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican City uses Italy in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by many of the state's workers while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to dig for in mines using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also proved that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have an alloy containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Every matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them are at the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the lapis was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, lapis was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to go to a computer.
Who knows what happens when something new is invented.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is taken to bind a nucleus to a large number of protons and neutrons.
Similarly, when a heavy chariot is pushed onto a rock, the nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the shell.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the nearest side and 100 km wide on the farthest side.
It is narrow below the marria and narrow below the highlands.
There may have been more seas of the moon on the near side because the shell is thin. It was easier for lava to rise on the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people happy or attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want things and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Needs Hierarchy Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start to manage their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, carry out evaluations, assign responsibilities, and see people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unknown individual who feels he must change who has made the team and make himself his own.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation have to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of the theoretical approach to cognition investigation, thus making the field of research less extensive and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brain.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong fantasy connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as calligraphy, voice and face recognition.
Such matters have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is built into various applications of home computer software and video games.
On-site travel is a big part of any classroom. Often, teachers like to take their students to places where there is no possibility of going by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual trips on the spot. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a trip on the spot is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, every year the website is updated, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blog experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts working to improve the writing so it doesn't get criticized.
Blogging also "makes students learn more about the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more worthy and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool, encouraging students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the unrivalled and bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and further north is the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further north have a rather sparse population and some are in a nearly uninhabited natural state.
For a surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent for it when we talk about wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman who is travelling say that she is married, what is her current state regarding marriage.
It is useful to wear a circle too (just not one that seems to be worth a lot of money.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider to be annoying and it is not uncommon to be followed, kidnapped, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether or not there are cultural differences, doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l'Badya and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy in all of Morocco.
Around ancient Medina, easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geegaws, but all are tourist.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which defended most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be re-researched to determine the state of war that still persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for snorkeling with the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (taxi motor) to drive around Goma.
Along with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the Southern African Grigal and runs along the border of Mozambique in the East, Zimbabwe in the North, and the southern border is the Kukkudrilli River (Crocodile River).
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the model of South African National Parks (South African National Parks - SANParks).
As in the case of all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and entry into the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides income for either selections of parks in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island (Hong Kong Island) gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The sculpture of the building forming the Hong Kong skyscrapers has been painted with a light-dusted slate bar as it is visible from the presence of the waters of Port Victoria.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists took for granted and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in wetlands  they include some of the last remaining positions of impressive forests that once covered the Gange Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/developed areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 tick-tailed deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-districts (river-long) bus station during the day, although most of them, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Since the inter-districts buses are often full, it is recommended that the ticket be purchased a few days in advance.
Many districts have small, convenient and solid Japanese Coaster Buses services.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.50 m high aisles.
The vertical void under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, not opened to traffic before March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called 'The Giant Province of the Indies', was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland lira (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British lira (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley by FIC West store.
English liris will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although it is possible that English and US currency will be accepted; speak to the owners in advance to see if a payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be extremely cold: the rare temperatures drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rain' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still graze wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/m away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose (large North American cranes), bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the appropriate distance.
However, you should be aware that the perfumes attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong perfumes and keep the field clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German casualties.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua's chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There is a lot of sand, as Auckland lies between two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in the district of North Harbour) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
They are almost all sand-dried with a safe swimming pool, and the majority have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
They are sandy for the family and are sometimes blown and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to find, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely to travel better.
Local tap water is good for drinking, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee called flat white is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is filled with plenty of cream (not butter), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards. Fruit juice costs a lot of money but it is excellent.
Many trips to the pond take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the pond are rare.
However, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to security messages.
The box-shaped jellyfish (box jellyfish) is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Although seals exist, they rarely attack people. Many seals are afraid of people and swim away from them.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveller will have a restful mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport/flight transport arrangements and even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendment or request shall be forwarded to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festivalgoers decide to camp on site, and many consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to arrive early to have a campsite near the music.
Remember that although music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the North Baltic in winter, look closely at the cabin location, because when you cross the ice it makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent on the guest. There are usually no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find exit points.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in good spirits, and to keep them in place.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but the sacrament disrupts judgment, and all good players know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider the possibility of fog, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On snow- and fog-stricken roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, you can quickly get enough snow to cool off.
The visibility may also be restricted by descending dust or fading or by condensation or snow on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, snow and fog conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to run for the most part without interruptions all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling on land to observe the wild and marvelous African animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and to standard equipment that allows good visibility.
Lions, citrus and leopards are sometimes distorted and are best seen with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "walking in the bush" (bush walk), "hike safari" (hiking safari), or "footing" (going)") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the postponement, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to be worth between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets are expected to be worth around ¥7,000.
The path on the clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have a pathway and board available for use, even if you don't have one in the room.
If a trailhead is not available, or if you do not want to wear passed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Care to be taken not to allow the fabric to heat up too much (which may cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, to burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if a minute of water is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter schizophrenic animals with which they are not familiar in the regions where they are staying.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free purchases are the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and surpluses in certain places.
Travellers to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often passes through isolated backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on the countryside, be careful: standing heights, narrow lanes and strong turns are prevalent.
The maximum speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections  commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their Southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastes are common, and cooked apples are used in pastes all year round, and waxes and tares begin in summer.
Many German dishes also contain lemon, jelly, and other tree nuts. Known cakes often go very well with a strong coffee grower.
If you want some small but rich meals, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
The curry is a spice-based dish, combined with meat or vegetables.
The load may be 'dry' or 'dried' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple-cooked tastes, and Javanese's predominant favorite flavours are carrots, chili, sugar (especially Javanese Indian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Staff are supports for the legs of the wrist that extend on each side of the seat.
They provide greater stability for the rope but may have safety issues due to the potential for rope feet to get caught.
If a horse falls from a horse but has a leg caught in the staff, it may be stung if the horse runs away.
First, many riders wear slippery boots and a rather shiny, silky coat.
Subsequently, some outlets, particularly English outlets, have a safety bar allowing the skin strip of the staff to be torn off the bar if pulled back by a falling strap.
Cochamó Valley (Cochamó Forest) - The main destination for Chilean fishing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large granite and stone walls.
The highest points include spectacular views from the cliffs.Showers from all parts of the world are continually setting new routes among its endless potential walls.
Snowshooting, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving snow-capped skis or snowboarding mounted to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around the skies in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave painters showing skiers go back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, ski touring or similar to alpine-style mountains, where the latter is done on a standing platform and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar fishing route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than you would walk  but it is only very rare that you will have the cross country  skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Artificial products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar goods produced in bulk.
The reindeer herding is an important livelihood among Sami people and the culture around trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mostly as animals to pull heavy weights.
Today many Sámi work in modern buildings. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word 'Gypsies' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel notice, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments and not yours, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often quick, general and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbance, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, snow, excessive rainfall, and wildfires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, air storms, sea storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include strong snowstorms, snowstorms, snowstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Any person who organises a visit to a country which may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Search the Internet for a hostile environment course, probably at the address of a local company.
Kors usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role play, plenty of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but there are not many publications about war zones.
Travellers planning a surgical operation for sexual reassignment abroad should ensure that they carry documents valid for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passport with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves cutting from the bay, often in a ditch or similar.
Due to the topology of the underwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a rapid flow to the deep water there.
Many deaths occur as a result of fatigue after trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the water, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to look for a place where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you have been caught, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock precedes the culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
Travellers who find it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adjust again to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your cultural habits.
When I travel, people will likely first take patience and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for returning travelers.
The display of the sound and light of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things about children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
You're always hearing the voices of tourists and sellers.
The Sphinks is used as the background and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are turned on.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the submerged caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join in the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or middle part of the Sentinel has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite telephony generally does not replace mobile phones, as you need to be outside a clear satellite view to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely with voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
A growing choice among those planning a year off study is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interim year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing.The 'Land of a thousand lakes' (Land with a thousand lakes) also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In islands and lakes you do not necessarily need a boat.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the distinct Cruises within the Baltic include an extended visit within St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using boarding excursions you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a fearful experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never been to or experienced a traumatic event before.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, a little understanding of the workings of airplanes and vehicles during flight can help them overcome fears that are based on unknowns or things they have no control over.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Time is often very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If air cargo is sent, some routes may take days to pass through land and customs.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to get a big buck of money for the privilege (or, even better, hire your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as approximate rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more than normal economic zero for business (business class), and eleven times more for first class (first class)!
It generally makes no sense to seek discounts for business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a significant group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were re-established between these two sides of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and activity-filled business center, built around huge beaches and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are tiled with traditional red-colored brick, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting carvings of pigeon marble on certain graves.
You won't regret spending half an hour walking around the intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, which became known to outsiders after a lavish description of its great beauty expressed by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the North, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Kappella), a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass gathering site, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women still alive today who managed to survive their time here, and many more who had their loved ones killed or exploited to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with dignity, solemnity and respect.
Do not commit vandalism on the spot by marking or painting graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are marked only in Catalan as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular subway notifications are made in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, calm and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to camp in Paris is still to behave well, and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-trained).
Parisian unfriendly attitudes quickly fade when you show them basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes Nature Park is covered with many trees, mainly pine, spruce and pine, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different acidity and different altitude levels.
The catchment area also contains an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare birds such as European cannibals, wolves, sharks, cocks, lynxes, wild cats and wild boar can be found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear clothes that cover their bodies and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shells for unprepared women, but if you bring yours, especially one of bright colors, you will receive a smile from the father or father-in-law in the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear body-covering skirts.
These may also be removed from the inventory at the entrance, but those items are not washed after each person who offers them and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these clothes.
Mexican cooking, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially maize), and uses olive oil in each dish.
Popular and simple, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, damask, and available spices such as cheese, tuna oil, etc.
All names, next to the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
This certainly makes reading easier, although writing is a bit complicated due to the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronouncing in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowels that follow them.
In addition, make sure to pronounce different r and r: caro means expensive, while car means car.
The Persian language has relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn much about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know Romanian, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational places.
Since light pollution at its best was not the type of problem we have today, they are generally found in cities or campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom display, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the target flower was the flower chosen.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a 'single' sample.
If you visit a formally organised garden, collecting  'samples' will also lead to your being expelled, without any discussions.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
But when placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will need to face both (always) heat and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a vacation around it.
For example visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or cruises to interesting cities on the Danube or boat shows along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular trails for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and it is celebrated as the closing of Jesus' birth.
Many of the traditions associated with the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition that Easter evening is spent in an exposed place to see the rising sun.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but there may also be a spring ritual and pre-Christian fertility.
More traditional churches often organize Easter Vigil on Saturday evenings during Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals originally arrived on the islands were brought here by swimming, boating or swimming.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant falcon became the main grazing animal within the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be somewhat or very dark all the time.
Since the areas are low in population, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that used by Westerners.
Suits are standard workwear, and colleagues call each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on group effort rather than encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their supervisors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their supervisors' instructions without reservations.
