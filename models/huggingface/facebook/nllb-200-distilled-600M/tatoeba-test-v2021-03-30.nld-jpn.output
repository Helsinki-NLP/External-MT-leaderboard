I don't understand German.
Tom lies on his back.
Tom is an orphan.
The man we saw this morning was Mr. Green.
The report found that many teenagers are addicted to alcohol.
Have you got a favorite singer?
Tom missed the last train and spent the night in an internet cafe.
You'd better go.
I wanna go somewhere in Europe.
The first prize is a kiss from the princess.
He lives in an apartment.
Where's the entrance?
Did you like the movie?
I wanted to surprise her.
Tom has a big problem.
I'm going to school.
When is the next train to Sloane Square?
The old man lives alone.
I'm up.
How old were you when you believed in Santa Claus?
I bought a watch.
He's already gone.
He was on the bed.
Of course he got mad.
He eats an apple.
I bought a book yesterday.

I quit smoking six months ago.
Didn't you hear your name being mentioned?
I'd like to read something for you on the train.
I like France.
That's clearly a lie.
Let's continue the discussion.
He went to America to learn English.
That's a weird question.
If you go to bed in these clothes, you'll catch cold.

If there's anything, let me know as soon as possible.
I'm from England.
She went shopping.
Listen to me.
Are you tired?

Can I hold your hand?
I visited Paris a long time ago.
The cloud is shaped like a fish.

Has she finished her work?
They just arrived.
I'm convinced he's innocent.
A shepherd dog drives a herd of sheep to the pasture.
She has big breasts.
Tom speaks relatively quickly, doesn't he?
Nobody gets happy from war.
Tom has a mustache growing.
You can dance, right?
She has no enemies.
Wait a minute.
John made mistakes the whole time.
B

He can't be older than me.
His sister is a remarkable beauty.
The study of Art requires excellent judgment.

Please go ahead.
Look at the picture.
I don't like science.
I'll give you five bucks.
Who discovered radium?

Show me that.
Statistics are concerned with numbers that represent reality.
It's an old piano.

When two people always have the same opinion, one of them is unnecessary.
Stop it!
His ideas never paid him a penny.
He laughs all the time.
Have you ever seen Tom angry?
He was injured in a traffic accident.
What are you doing here?
The doctor took my wrist.
Thank you, Doctor.

We must have something to live for.
His blow didn't go far.
I don't have time to go to America.
I'm not a teacher.
I was called to the scene of the accident.
A cat has nine lives.
Can I ask why?
Can you please wait a minute?
Hurry up!
He plays guitar well.
I'd appreciate it if she sat next to me.
There are few people who can understand his theory.
From a distance, the hill looks like an elephant.
Japanese have dark eyes.
It's boring to stay home.

It's easy to go to hell.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
He said he didn't know.
Tom is a friend of mine.
I have a twin sister.
There's some wine left on the bottom of the glass.
You knew that?
Ah, that's it.
I want to write an article.
I don't have a pencil.
Have you heard this piece of music before?
We were standing outside the door, waiting.
Verbs have intransitive verbs that cannot have a suffering object, and transitive verbs that can have a suffering object.
He's eight.
Watch your step.
You like music?
I have a big problem.
The bike under the tree is mine.
Black party dresses look great on her.
Mayuko left the room.
We went to Boston.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He doesn't live in Sendai.
The clock is still. He needs a new battery.
I'm just watching.
She's attractive.
How are you feeling today?
We must win over our rivals.
I got up at 6:00 this morning.
Here's a big map of Germany.
Do you know who this is?
I fell asleep watching TV.
Who is this boy?
How long have you been here?
Don't close the door.
I'll think about it.
Should I call an ambulance?
The meeting took place yesterday.
Kioto is at its best in the autumn.
He said you didn't have to go.
We went to Gifu.
A friend today is a enemy tomorrow.
She has many friends in Hong Kong.
I don't have a cat.
I want to stay here.

Honestly, I don't like your idea.
He lay on his back.
You told the truth?
What are you talking about?
Which faculty is he from?
You got your cell phone now?
I spent a lot of money on my house.
Tom is engaged to Mary's younger sister.
He must be aware of the danger.
Can I get something to eat?
Let's go by car.
You don't have to do it right away.
Which CD do you want to listen to?
Telefono was invented by Bell in 1876.
Do you speak Italian?

I am an American.

I'm glad I could help you last week.
I didn't need your help.
The water is frozen.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
I'm watching television.
He walks in the park every morning.
She doesn't have many friends in Kyoto.
Speak clearly so everyone can hear you.
I'm going to bake a cake for Maria's birthday.
The traffic light went green.
What a pity!
Which brand do you like?
He makes a lot of money on the stock market.
Tom now lives with his uncle.
Oddly enough, he failed.
I want a lot more.
How are you feeling today?

I felt I had to.
What are you afraid of?
She had the benefit of the sound investment.
Japan is in the northern hemisphere.
I'm so busy, my head's so full.
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
He hated lying.
He seems to know us.

I will never forget you.
I'm always ready to die.
The climate here is very similar to the climate in England.
The girl was seriously injured in the traffic accident.
But a little, please.

Ever since we met, I've been thinking, what a lovely voice he has.

I can't explain it either.
I invited them to the party.
Can I turn off the TV?
You wanted to tell me about freedom?

You said I could never win?
I'm a new student.
Why are you holding my hands?
He doesn't like the principal.
The old man fell to the ground.

Stop with that.
Tom can swim well.
She opens the window.
I'm sorry, I won't do it again.
He's the father of three children.
I can walk.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
He wears sunglasses.
Why did you live in Kyoto last year?

That's an incredible distance, isn't it?
I wish you'd come sooner.
When did you get back from London?
There's a pen on the desk.
The house is on fire.
We study the past for the future.
Starting again.
Papa fixed my old watch.
You've done your homework?
Tough work made Japan what it is today.
Lynn runs fast.

This is beyond my imagination.
It would be nice if there was a Japanese edition.
For once, I'm right.
I wanna sleep a little longer.
Don't worry about it.
I want to visit Korea.

Tom and Frank are good friends.
Do you know what time it is?
Have you watched any movies lately?
All men are equal.
Who's the manager of that baseball team?
️Please fill the tank.
I like French.
This is my daughter.
It's an absolute secret for Tom.
What if I can't?
I usually go to bed at 10:00.
After dinner, she studied Japanese.
Most young people don't know the horror of war.
We clean up after school.

I think his life is in danger.
Why are you lying?

First they saw the mess, then they looked at each other.
I don't like the way he talks.
She filled the glass with wine.
He can't do it.

You like black cats?
While he's resting, he's listening to music.

I think it's true.
I can't know everything.
I have to think of my children.
Tom was born where?
Our teacher seemed surprised.
It was a scorching thunderstorm of half an hour.
Is she a computer programmer?
I wonder who this strange law is for.
You don't have to answer this question.
I finished my work at 6:00.
I've done my work.
The boulevard runs parallel to the beach.
I was watching the TV when the phone rang.
Let's go.
How long have you been working here?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Yesterday was Thursday.
Both parents are alive.
There's something wrong with the motor.
Stop it!
She has an uncle who works in a bank.
I have a stomachache.
Who wrote this book?
Where are you going?
Nice to meet you.
Tom has blown out the candles.

Tom brought Mary a present.
I think she's over 40.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I have two daughters.
She was afraid of the dog.
I visited her on Sunday morning.
Let's rest a while.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
You smoke?
He didn't speak French well.
Let's take the train.
What age do you want to get married?
What a coincidence!
I fell asleep.
My brother is healthy.
Why are you still up?
Mama, Tom ate my cookie!

I'm a candyman.
I'm off on Sunday.
Hold the vase with both hands.
Tom was injured.
The big fish eat the little ones.
A impatient driver crossed the intersection without paying attention to the red traffic light.
They share the same opinion on that subject.
I saw a UFO.
What age do you want to get married?
I haven't read either book.
You smoke?

I'm mad at her.
There are pictures here that were taken at risk of life.
She likes fishing.
Tom has low blood pressure.
He won the prize last week.
I got a letter from her.

Do you like dogs or cats?
Hooray!
There's blood coming out of the wound.

Close your eyes.
I rested under the big tree.
Yesterday was my birthday.
Sport knows no bounds.
What a beautiful city!
John.
Help!
I eat breakfast every morning.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
Sometimes it hurts to tell the truth.
They sunk ten enemy ships.

Muiriel is now 20 years old.
That's our house.
Honestly, I can't trust him.
When it comes to quality wine, there is no country like France.
That can't be true.
This way, we're wasting a lot of time.
5 million yen.
Swim to the other side of the river to cross.
Can you lend me a dollar?
He has a very vivid imagination.
The best horse stumbles sometimes.
What a beautiful city!
His concert was great.

There are pitless grapes and pitless watermelons, but would there be pitless mangoes?
I have a twin brother who looks exactly like me.

He looks like his mother.
This is a little book.
I'm looking for my camera.
I'm not healthy.

The top of Fuji was covered with snow.

You're young, but I'm very old.
What are you writing?
️Don't forget to turn off the lights.

You're just in time.
I lost the watch my father gave me.
She offered me a cup of tea.
They're ignoring me.
I think Tom should eat more.
I'm almost as tall as her.
She plays piano very well.
You should have introduced yourself.
India has a large population.
That's weird.
I got her letter yesterday.
Is she Japanese?
Come and help me.
Please answer the phone.

The war started three years later.
Jane is a very charming girl.
When it's dark, you can't let her out.
I'm left-handed.
I'm a sportsman.
I'll answer within three days.
Don't worry about it.
Eat your spinach all over.
I wonder who I'd invite.

I'm used to staying up late at night.
He had no doubt that Ben had something to do with the crime.
Why is he here?
He's a gentleman.
I'm going to church by car.
We eat lunch together often.
I don't know.
I got up late this morning.
I'll be home for a day tomorrow.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
History repeats itself.
How was the test?
I'd rather fish than meat.
I was born in Osaka.
Where's her house?
The water was polluted with oil.
Did everything go well with yesterday's earthquake?
I'd like to eat something sweet.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We use sticks instead of fork and knife.
She's got flowers in her hand.
Give him my regards when you see him.
He was lying there with his legs tied together.
I'm looking for a present for my mom.
Can we take a taxi?
She talked a lot about her experiences abroad.
Don't chase me like that.
As far as we know, the Earth is the only planet with oceans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She burst out laughing.
Keep your classroom clean.
As far as I know, there were no problems during the first semester.
I managed to get in.
My father doesn't like football.
There's nothing left to do but kill him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
No, but I play tennis.
Do you hate me?
We're good friends.
I agree with you.
It's two miles from here to the train station.
️Maybe it'll rain this afternoon.
I'm taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
Chinese food is as good as French food.
As a friend, he takes responsibility.
Why don't you believe me?
That's not a cat.
I don't want to go alone.
If you show me how to do it, I'll do it.
The question was too difficult for me to solve.
My brother works at a bank.
He moved to Tokyo.
The cat was playing with a live mouse.
He's eating an apple.
I study from eight to eleven.
He didn't let anyone get involved in his private affairs.
I have to get my bike fixed.
Tom and Mary forgot the time while telling each other about their dreams.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm just watching.
I'm really hungry now because I haven't had breakfast.
Which faculty did he go to?
So what?
I was very tired.
This is where they usually dine.
Her speech was excellent.
Please call a doctor.
She kissed me all of a sudden.
What if I said no?
️It's awfully cold today.
Please shut up!
Never ends here.
Snow is gone.
Can I touch it?
You're hiding something, aren't you?
The advantage of marriage is that you get to know the true nature of the female gender, and the disadvantage of marriage is that you get to know the dehumidification about the female gender, so unmarried writers are not yet able to write women, and their married poets are no longer able to sing praises to women.
I'm in an old castle now.
Who is that girl?
Tom has stopped using Facebook.
I'm far from happy with this situation.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's married and has two children.
Who is he?
Who's this umbrella from?
Betty is a dance teacher.
She likes him.
You couldn't let me do that?
Your mother is very young, isn't she?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What do you think, Tom?
I bought a pair of boots.
How many rooms are there in your house?
Lincoln was against slavery.
Tom looked good.
Can you answer this?
She's accepted at Harvard.
Please don't go.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm not ashamed of being poor.
My sister is very intelligent.
What?
My friend is learning Korean.
He gave me a present.
How many books does he have?
I can't sleep.
I'm walking to school.
Why me?
Who gave you this?
!
I should have stayed at home.
I'll send you a copy of this image as soon as possible.
I need something to write with.
He loves science fiction.
He speaks fluent Japanese.
I was late for the appointment.
I walked.
I'm fat.
Turn left on the next corner.
I'd rather travel by train than by plane.
Tom tried to forget his love grief by playing piano.
Wake me up at 7:00, please.
I gave the car the signal to drive slower.
People think this story is real.
I don't know where my watch is.
How are you feeling today?
Can I sit here?
Why are you sitting under the desk?
Tom didn't believe what Mary said.
You should start with books that are easy to understand.
You did it on purpose!
If you're angry, count to ten before you say anything.
Let me try again.

You just have to clean your room.
I know where you live.

I'd like a cup of tea.
Why do you enjoy it when other people suffer?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She called us out loud to come help.
I don't have the address.
She's a little shy.
I don't know why I like Tom so much.
Thank you, Doctor.
Belgium is not as big as France.
I've always believed that a heart attack is the announcement of an impending death.

If you don't eat your ice cream fast, it'll melt.
I'm relieved you're safe.
I'd rather quit than go work under him.

I'm a cat. I don't have a name yet.
She's six years older than me.
Maria has blue eyes.

I don't know anything about Japan.
They warned the ship of danger.
Where can I get my baggage?
No movement!
I'd like to ask you two questions.
When that volcano suddenly erupted, many people died.
She sings very well.
I wanna go to the movies.
In times of crisis, never idealize the past.
Stop it!

What's the phone number at the Tokyo Dome?
She has absolutely no enemies.
You still awake?
Are you an exchange student?
Kyoto is worth a visit.
They believed the world was flat.

I read the book till page 80 yesterday.
You live in Sasayama?
He couldn't believe his own eyes.
Italia is not Greece.
Staying home is boring.
I like to study English.
He's a real scholar.
I went to the hospital to visit my wife.
I can't go any further.
Ask Tom.
Why are you up so late?
Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the station?
"Thank you very much", she said with a smile.
It's almost my birthday.
The current password is "eosdigital".
Tatoeba
Mama bought my brother a yellow umbrella.

Please tell me your name.
My father is only 15 years old.
She went shopping.

Someone called my name in the dark.
You mean that?
Tom is forgetful.
What's your name?
New York is a big city.
She's happy with the company.
Don't let go of my hand.
He's studying Chinese.
He has a son and two daughters.
In case you cannot come, please contact us as soon as possible.
Believe it or not, but that woman has three children.
Stop!
Snow started melting.
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
I need money.
Drugs addiction is the cancer of modern society.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I met Mary on the street yesterday.
He weighs ten kilos more than me.
Can you wipe that pan?
I'm not happy with the job I'm in right now.
They have twin daughters.
Can I interrupt you?
Let me introduce you to Mr. Brown.
He's a DJ.
Solve the mystery behind the murder.
The horse broke his neck when it fell.
Do I have it wrong?
Can I sit here?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What does this mean?
Roger works from early morning till late at night.
There's one more question we need to discuss.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There is no objection on my part.
I'm sleeping in the car.
He likes to read newspapers.
That's not Jack's fault.
How many English words do you know?
I'm in the bathroom right now.
My sister went to Kobe yesterday.
️Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
He's supposed to be living in Nagano, so what's he doing at Tokyo Station?
The glittering stars in the evening sky looked like gemstones.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Do you have a car?
I made Tom cry.
He went to Paris and lived there for five years.
You're students, and only now can you do something like that!
Glass is made of sand.
It's too small.
Tom has a tendency to exaggerate.
"I forgot to say you need sandals, so don't forget to take them with you"."What? I should have said sooner!"
The wind is blowing.
Well, it might be that he's smart, but he makes mistakes often by not paying attention.
A bird flew high in the air.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The plan will work.
Even a child can answer that question.
The war ended in 1945.
Thank God nothing is broken.
The man attacked her with the intention of killing her.
I don't know what to say to Tom.

She's interested in jazz.

Cherry blossom is now at its peak.
Have you asked Tom?
Do I have to go now?
Uniforms differ from school to school.
She's definitely busy.
I need your help.
He came into the room.
Don't follow me.
I'll be with you in an hour.

Her friends were waiting for her at the gate.
Don't leave the door open.
He says he's always been loyal to his wife.
Everything is flowing.
Have you finished your homework?
He ran so he could be on time.
From the moment we met, I thought, what a lovely voice she has.
What time did you go to bed last night?
Even if it's not easy, I'll keep doing my best.

Alice didn't see the dog.
Papa and mama were sitting under a tree.
Where are you from?
He'll be arriving in Kyoto tomorrow.
I'm glad your team won the game.
I forgive you for this once.
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
Do you want to go to the station with me?
What are you doing with that umbrella?
Why did you buy flowers?
I got up early to catch the first train.
I like reading books.
The girl I told you about lives here.

You know his older brother?
I bought a pen as a birthday present.

Workaholics consider vacation a waste of time.
He made me wait.
I have many friends who help me.
There were a lot of rotten apples in the basket.
He has a sharp ear.
I like foreign languages.
He quit smoking.

Mary was kidnapped by pirates.
️Poets choose the best words.
She has a lot of money.
Here's what we wanna know.
I can't remember anything.
I didn't need your help.
I'm sorry, but that's really impossible.
Mayuko came into the room.
Wait till morning.
I lost my watch.
He has a long teaching experience.
She's eight.
He must be stupid to do that.
How are you supposed to eat this?
If possible, you should investigate the matter yourself.
I saw a big dog lying outside Mr. Hills' house.
Can I go to bed?
Bacteria are just small, harmless cells.
Can you please post this letter for me?
He paid 1000 yen for this book.
Listen to what I'm saying.
Do you love me?
Nire phone number is 9876-5432.

The hound went into the woods.
My mom gets up earlier than anyone.
He's at the meeting.
Where are my cigarettes?
She's two years older than you.
I hear with my ears.
I have to fix it.
The child had a pure heart.
In Japan politicians are laughed at more often than loved ones in manga.
I watch TV.
I met my old friend at the airport.
Do you know her father?

Fish live in the water.
The police were unable to cope with such violence.
He greeted me with a smile.
He has many enemies in the political world.
His memory loss is more of a psychic than a physical limitation.
Come here!
I work at a bank.

How was the test?
All right.
I bought some ice cream sauces, but you want one too?
Is your father a doctor?
Come and help me.
She became happy.
The lid won't go off.
My grandfather is always in this chair.
I'll give you a good advice.
I'm playing with him.
I have to go shopping.
Don't forget the card.
She's older than him.
I agree with you.

I like dogs.
We're hungry
He's my friend.
Thank you for worrying about me.
She said, "Thank you for the meal" to the cook.
The old man fell to the ground.
She got married when she was 17.
Let's try it again.
The policeman took the boy's knife.
Are you planning on eating that all by yourself?
How many cats are there in this house?
Tom is engaged to Mary's little sister.
Where's the paper?
What do you think of this parka?

She's done writing a letter.
He lives one floor above me.
I think so too.
Have you ever smoked?
Yesterday was my birthday.
We couldn't see anything but fog.

Do you know who they are?
He died yesterday.
Nice work!
Water is essential for plants.
You won't kill.
He slept for an hour.
Tom's grandmother looks healthy.

I have no objection.

My daughter loves to jump rope.
You must be polite to every guest.
Tom is quick.
He did it himself.

The man committed murder.
I have many dreams.
I thought so.
Close the door.
How old are you?
This tastes good.
I feel like it's been a long time since I heard that last.
I only have one wish.
You're always late.
When Tom woke up, Mary was at the desk reading a book.
I have time now.
Keeping a journal also gives us the opportunity to reflect on our daily lives.
I met Tom this evening.
He moved to Tokyo.
He reads the paper every morning.
He's much bigger than you.
What time did you go to bed last night?
Mary and Maki are sisters.
I don't know.
I know where he lives.
It's strange that you don't know anything about her wedding ceremony.
Oh, no!
They gave me a big party.
Slowly.

The cat is very sweet.
Tom always watches TV.
I usually get up at 8:00.
They believe that the soul is immortal.
I mean it!
We played tennis yesterday.
Hey!
"Does she play tennis?" "Yes".
The judge sentenced him to one year in prison.
My mother is two years older than my father.
Turn on the light, I can't see anything.

Yes, I did.
Is this a recent photo?
I want to stay here.
Welcome to our group.
️Pesa telah mengubah hidupnya.
I'm sorry, I'm 30 minutes late because I fell asleep.
I saw the man entering the room.

I wonder when Anna's coming.
I think he was angry.
I want something delicious.
I agree with you.
What are you doing here?
I am deeply ashamed.
I have a twin sister who looks exactly like me.
Please take a seat here.
We must follow the rules.
It's very dark.
Say hello to your friends.
Someone's calling you at the gate.
She likes cats.
He goes there every day.
How about February 28th around 3:00 p.m.?
Tom has begun talking to his girlfriend about breaking up.
How was the test?
Never seen a living whale.
It's under the chair.
If you think about it, my father's life was a happy one.
You think Santa still exists?
Tony? Where is Tony?
Warn Tom please.
Can you hear me?

The child was on the couch.
I'll be right back.
I'd like to have that book that I lent you the other day back.
Be careful.
I can't wait any longer.
Cherries are red.
He's a football player.
I found your diary.
You come here often?

I have to go so slow.
Tom has a strong sense of responsibility.
You look tired, so you better get some sleep.
At first, I didn't know what to do.
There are many animals to see in this forest.
I'm very generous.
The girl I told you about lives here.
Stop it!

Why are you pretending not to know me?
I have pain in my eyes.

We've started a campaign against smoking.
Don't lie to me.
When he met the woman, he lit his hat to greet her.
Let's try something!
He quit smoking.
Where would you like to sit?
I invited my neighbors to dinner.
Around the corner, she turned left.
I'm tall.
I don't know.
I'm sorry to call you so late. I just wanna hear your voice.
They gave us plenty to eat.

Tom's voice is so sexy! I get butterflies in my stomach!
Take good care of yourself.
Free advice isn't always good advice.
I have to find my pen.
I agree with you.
What a surprise to see you here.
I live with my parents.
You got a fever?
Suddenly there was an explosion.

She traveled all over the world.
I was in the mountains.
My father gets up early.
Is she not a doctor?
It's new.
What would you do if you had 10,000,000 yen?
Get up!

Do you want me to call the police?

The world has changed.
Why do you love an idiot like me?
I helped him yesterday.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Thoughts are expressed in words.
What are you doing?
I have a book in my hand.
There were a lot of people in the park.
My brother's watching TV.
I can't wait any longer.
Mary works in a supermarket.
I don't like it either.
I lost my car key.
I ordered two teas and three coffees.

At first, I thought he was your brother.
Tom and Frank are good friends.

You don't have to apologize for that, Tom, because I'm the one who just fell in love with you.
My brother became an engineer.

We translated the novel from Japanese to English.
Please take off your hat.
Green is good for you.
He's an early bird.
He solved that problem easily.
Tom always brings the rain with him.
I'm happy to come.
In this case, you're wrong.
I don't know.
What?
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
I wonder who I'd invite.
Bill will be back next week.

How much is the beer?
How was the concert?
The person I spoke with was German, not American.
What time is it now?
I learned a lot from Tom.
I'm tired!

"I like when people say I'm cute", Tom said a little embarrassed.
I could enjoy my day off the most by spending time with you.
Tom broke something again?
I have enough friends to help me.
I'm sorry about that.
Tom did not eat dinner last night.
Why is the baby crying?
Please introduce yourself for three minutes.
You live in Turkey?
There's a book open on the desk.
You should sleep.
I got up at 6:00 this morning.
What have you decided?
He recommended me to this dictionary.
I think so too.
Don't forget your stuff.
He's in the kitchen.
He lied to us.
How hungry are you, Tom?
No problem.
Come by, please.
Bus stop?
Don't leave the door open.

I don't think being poor is something to be ashamed of.
Tom has nothing to do with this.
Tom was already trying to distract himself from his love grief by playing piano.
He talks a lot.

It's true he won first prize.
Is there a place you wanna go?
Both my parents are dead.
He lives in Osaka.
That's mine.
We welcome everyone who thinks they're coming to the party.
Experience is the best teacher.
I've been reading this book.
That hurts!
️ Writing a love letter in English is not easy.
Let me go alone.
Are you mad?
Tom swims as well as Mary.
I got too long.
I need your help.
️Please hold your breath.
I showed her my room.
Can you please wait an hour?
I thought it was true.
She came back disappointed.
The sun has nine planets.
I have to bring this book back to the library today.
After dinner, I washed.
Rice with curry is my favorite.

Can we have a drink together?
Turn the radio up a little.
I still hate you.
A swarm of mosquitoes followed him.
I read the book from mouth to mouth.
Sometimes I dream about home.
There's no point in using a slug like that.
How much do you think this sweater costs?
I went fishing in the river yesterday.
I hid under the table.
There's a hole in his sock.
He dressed as a woman.
How's your family?
I'd rather go outside than stay inside.
He's not capable of doing that.
Who runs faster, Jumi or Keiko?

It's Saturday.
I'll join you later.
He was exhausted when he got home.
He hesitated to go home and keep working in the office.
Please call the police.
It's too big.
I'm writing a letter.
The cat is black.
If we don't hurry, we'll be late.
I can't remember as many signs as I can.
They made me wait forever.
She was beautiful when she was young.
They left last night.
Can you hear me?
Whatever you do, do your best.
He looked down at the valley under him.
They greeted me with a smile.

Is his father a doctor?
How are you feeling today?
After breakfast, I hurried to school.
Can I have another piece of cake?
The cold climate had an impact on his health.
Nice to meet you.
Can I call you Tom?
That was a mistake.
He's bigger than his father.
You were home last night?
Who is that person with Tom?
It was a long time ago.
Tom seldom laughs.
There were hundreds of people in the square.
The truth is, he doesn't know anything about it.
Come back soon!
Ken knows Tom's real name?
Except for this error, this is a good report.
Green looks great on you.
He's getting older.
I'm gonna write a letter tomorrow.
One more step and you're dead.
She bought vegetables yesterday.

The black angel spread out his glitter-black wings and flew to the sky.
I bought her a new car.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
You're studying English.
I wish I'd stayed home.
Tom, there's no need to apologize.
There are 43 prefectures in Japan.
She practices piano in the afternoon or evening.
I have nightmares often.
The sign is dirty.
Can I eat this bread?

She's expecting a baby.
He was a brave soldier.
You're not a woman.
I had to hide under a tree for the rain.
I remember the man's name very well.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Her claim was false.
I like to travel by train.
I can run.
Even a child can do something like that.
There's nothing more heartwarming to me than an old couple walking hand in hand across the street.
He's still here?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I ran at the speed of lightning.
It rained last night.
He doesn't have as many books as she does.

When will you be back at school?
How much is that?
I like summer the most.
Tom blew out the candle.
He goes to Karuizawa every year.
️We've had a lot of rain this month.
Tom made a choice.
We became friends with Tom.
Can you read phonetic signs?
I'm Paul, your roommate.
I guess so.
I haven't had breakfast yet.
The sky is blue.
I started crying.
Yesterday, the shopping street came alive.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't believe this!
She's five years younger than me.
The concert started with a piano solo.
Cats like fish more than meat.
There were no clouds today.
He bought a digital.
"Did it stop raining?""No, it's still raining"."It's stopped raining?""No, it's still raining"."It's stopped raining".
He's not lying.

Do you want to go to the movies?
She's a teacher.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Who is the one you were talking to?
What happened?
I can't lend you this book.
She has blue eyes.
He's a tennis player.
I'm used to the noise.
I love you more than I love her.
"I wish I was that tall"."Oh yeah? You're not good enough to be that tall, you know. And you bump your head against the ceiling sometimes".
I have many dreams.
Her cheeks were red.
I like his music.
Bill is not as big as Bob.
We stayed there for three months.
I have nothing to write with.
I take the train to work every day.
There was an old king who lived on a small island.

Don't touch me!
As it is said, done.
I like listening to classical music.

Reading a book is interesting.
Are you still up?

She was sitting next to me.
What's your date of birth?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Finally!
Tom lives in a small village.
I have something to tell you.
He went to bed at ten o'clock, as usual.
Why do you cook so well?
You mustn't give up.
I'm lucky today.
I'm full!
Prince Charles will be the next king of England.
Pardon Tom.
The applicant gave the person receiving the interview a good impression.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Impossible!
I'm unemployed.
I let go of the rope.
Don't take it seriously.
It's not easy to write with chalk.
Can I ask you something weird?
She doesn't believe in God.
I broke a glass.
Can I borrow your pen?
She suddenly stopped.
Tatoeba is truly multilingual. All languages are connected.
Tom, that's none of your business.

There are too many things to do!
He really likes to travel.
He's got a lot of money.
She came home disappointed.
Come on!
They acted as if they knew nothing.
A computer can calculate things extremely quickly.
Nice to meet you, Ken.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I like fishing by the river.
I tried not to cry today.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Let's talk about the experiments being done in laboratories first.
Can I open the window?
I agree with you on this one.
Hello!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Listen to me very carefully.
I went fishing in the river yesterday.
There is no doubt about who will be chosen.
She became a nurse.
There are many slums in Mexico.
For children, the world is full of wonders and miracles.
The train was going 500 miles an hour.
Why are you crying?
Calm down.
️You can smoke here.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They started at the same time.
Normally I go to bed at ten.
I got a letter from her.
How many languages do you speak?
I guess so.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's cold.
She was wearing a red skirt.
Tom alright?
I listened to the radio last night.
You got an eye on anyone now?
It's awful today.
The big fish eats the small fish.
Let's wait here until she gets back.
Maria has long hair.
I tried to pick her up, but she was just crying.
I'm on a diet.
Let's skip the class.
Gods exist.
I don't like the way he talks.
Hello, Tom.
Tom persuaded her to go to the movies with him.
My sister is famous.
That's exactly what I thought.
️Mrs. Kanda is a good swimmer.
He doesn't speak French.
Champagne, please.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He became famous.
I left something in the room.
I'll go too, unless it rains.
My father was busy.
I know where he is.
I'd appreciate it if you'd do that for me.
Relax please
What day is it today?
Did it rain yesterday?
We enjoyed the party.
What do you think?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What's going on?
I like languages.
I like sports like boxing and hockey.
I can't swim.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I missed the train in two minutes.
The doctor examined the patients.
Bill has many friends.
How much is it?
Mom, hurry up!
He wanted to succeed, even at the expense of his health.
What do you think of the Gulf War?
I can't think of any other way.
Don't be late with this assignment.
The boy grabbed the dog by the tail.
Hurry up!
Tom arrived three minutes early.
The idea that money can buy anything is wrong.
Tom got into the car.
He was raised by his uncle.
I forgot I met her last month.
That's a secret.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom was crying.
️Choose a dress that you like.
I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
His record will never be broken.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can hear Tom's voice.
What time did you go to bed last night?
What kind of songs does Tom sing with karaoke?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I thought he was a doctor.
We went to the park to play.
You like to swim?
They were born in Thailand.
He reported his accident to the police.
Ah, it's snowing!
It's all right.
Do you have matches?
I wonder if he'll be back tomorrow.
Papa is a good man.
The whole family came out of the car.
How long ago did you come to Japan?
She baked me a cake.
She's not only beautiful, she's nice.
He lived in a remote house from the village.
Ah, stop that!
I wanna give my mom a plant.
The road here splits in two.
There's no other way?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It was love at first sight.
Base  neutralize acids.
I plan to go to Hokkaido tomorrow.
We sang aloud.
I don't like him.
He makes a lot of money on the stock market.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Iris, what do you usually eat for breakfast?
Hug Tom.
I see.
Guess where I've been?
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
My son came to my room.
What a big dog!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Was there an affair?
You're the reason I'm here.
He was looking out the window.
Love and peace.
The rain went over into snow.
I went to the post office.
I don't want to die yet.
It's two miles from here to the station.
I want to buy some aspirin.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

4219 is a very unfortunate number.
We thought it was only natural that he would come.
I need friends.
He gets his pants stretched every day.
You can rent a boat an hour.
Let's keep it today.
I have a friend whose father is a veterinarian.
Why me?
I have a twin brother.
I have many friends.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When it comes to movies, I like everything, if not horror.
We're learning Arabic.
I wish I had a beautiful girlfriend.
Mama bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
Do you really believe ghosts exist?
We got English homework tomorrow, right?
He was standing there with his eyes closed.
Tom cried.
Even though she was a woman, she was brave.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I want him to read this.

There are many galaxies in the universe.
It could attack us any minute.
The man I thought was my friend cheated on me.
All roads lead to Helsingør.
Let me buy you a new one.

I haven't lost any weight.
What are you looking at?
What do you want to eat?
The tree could fall any minute.
Please hurry!
I'm eating an apple.
I felt like I had to cry when I heard the news.
Toro isn't always here.
Mr. Brown has four children.
That's another problem.
But we have nothing in common.
She urged the child to be more careful.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The train arrived in London.
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
The big fish eats the little ones.
I believe you.

What age do you want to get married?
We've chosen John as captain.
After all, everyone has to learn for themselves.
It's easier to have fun than to work.
I'm a teacher too.
The sun is rising.
He's always home on Monday.
I'd like to ask you two questions.
I can't fix the computer.
He had a prosperous and pleasant life on the land.
That's why I got up early this morning.
I should have come sooner.

He's changed a lot, and he's not the same as he used to be.
The earth is round.
Lock the door.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.

You'd better get your cigarette out before Terry sees it.
He lives near the school.
She went there yesterday.
I have a stomach ache.
Tom is not wearing a shirt.
She tried to smile in vain.
She thinks she's always right.
I agree with you.
I'll get another towel.
Can you repeat that?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
Look at me.
"Who is that?""That's Jim".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who bought this dress yesterday?
I live in Japan.
Bill was killed by that man.
What am I gonna do today?
He passed on all his knowledge to his son.
I found a good Mexican restaurant.
They gave us a lot of things to eat.
How do you know?
He's a member of the golf club.
She laughed so loud she cried.
The air is blurred by the winter sky.
No, Dad.
Tom was my first love.
As soon as I saw him, I knew he was angry.
Water, please.
He's a man of noble blood.
She can play piano.
His life is full of problems.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We all looked out the window.
Excuse me, what was your name again?
I bought it for about $12.
He had three sons.
He probably won't be able to work.
There will be objections to your proposal.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
She didn't read the book.
The singer has a beautiful voice.
I live in Tokyo.
The car kept speeding.
We're out of bread.
When I'm older, I want to marry Tom.
You can't trust him.
Can I ask your name?
His story sounds weird.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Giant pandas are found only in China.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
What are you doing in such a cold place?
He insulted me for no reason.
She was wearing a silk dress.
I can't live without you.
I'm on a diet.
Are processing costs charged?
We love each other.
If I knew his address, I'd write to him.
I had to walk because there were no taxis.

What did the doctor say?
A year has 12 months.
I've known her since she was a little girl.
I like foreign languages.
I need newspapers to keep up with the latest developments.
You must not go swimming in that deep river under any circumstances.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We must always obey the laws.

Bob is my friend.
He's on board the ship.
Cherry blossom is now at its peak.
How much money does he have?
Tom had a good time in Boston.
Whose books are these?
Can I touch this?
He pushed the button and waited.
Time flies by.
My father has many books.
Where is Britney Spears?
She's two years older than me.
My mother is a lawyer.
Solar energy is a new energy source.
You smoke?
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

He gets up early.
As a hobby, I like to travel to places in the country and abroad where I haven't been before.
How much is it for a person?
I haven't had breakfast yet.

Pistols do not kill people.

A wise man learns from his mistakes.
I like languages!
Tom has lost his job.
We're students, so let's just get out of here!
She makes $30 a day.
Have you seen Tom's mother?
Call me.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I'd like a drink.
Listen to what I'm saying.
️Choose one person.
We spoke softly so that the baby wouldn't wake up.
His whole family works on a farm.
Who will play the role of princess?
He stayed in bed all day.
Hiromi wears a new dress.
Tom speaks how many languages?
David is home.
He's married and has two children.
I'm a cat. I don't have a name yet.
Most villagers are fishermen.
He tried to kill himself because he lost her love.
Do you know who she is?
I'll wait here until she gets here.
You dropped your pocketcloth.
The roof of my house is red.
I like to play piano.
When did you meet her?
Why are you crying?
Have you any objections?
Doctors are generally not trained in raising children.
How many languages do you speak?
Send this by express mail.
Did you understand what he said?
I gave that poor boy a little something.
How was your weekend?

I don't know his name.
Finally spring has come to this part of Japan.
I'll call you later.
Thank you very much for all your efforts.

I'll visit him tomorrow.
He's supposed to give a speech at the party.
I'm used to cooking for myself.
He came to school even though he's sick.
I got there too early.

Have you got a beer?
You come from a musical family?
It's raining, can you see?
Get rid of my arm!
It's not good to stay up late at night, huh?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I still have a throbbing headache, but the fever is gone.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm gonna grab a video for you.
Can you repeat what you said?
Hello, is Mr. Freeman here?
Let's see that.
I asked her if I could read the book.
The newspapers don't report on this news.
He might have been ill.
If only she were alive.
His wife is French.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I know him by face, but I've never really spoken to him.
Have you been to Paris?
John can't speak French very well.
I see!
I have a twin sister.
My father loves my mother.
When did you get back from Tokyo?
I think Tom is lucky.
He's strong.
It's two miles from here to the station.
Look at this!
He went to America to learn English.
That's very romantic!
When I was a kid, I used to go fishing.
Can I call around 3:30?

I'm in the bath.
Do you want to go to the movies?
Now we're finally alone with the two of us.
I'm taking the 10:30 train.
Tokyo is bigger than Rome.
Thank you for waiting.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have a sharp pain in my chest chest.
Will you be present at the meeting this afternoon?
He was exhausted when he got home.
They ignore me.
️This book is new.
I don't want to go to the pool.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
"Hey, Tom"."What's up?""Leave it alone".
It's snowing.
It's too small.
She waited for him for hours.
Have you read any interesting books lately?
Why were you silent the whole time?
Bob was a little fatter than his brother.
Her eyes are laughing.
It's too small.
I thought the same thing when I was young.
Potverdorie, I spent too much money.
I was very hungry.
It rained all day yesterday.
They're as strong as us.
Let go of the rope.
Open your eyes.
Nara is as old as Kyoto.
Let's play tennis after school.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
They had a lot of respect for Dr. Schweitzer.
Thank you!

I started having trouble understanding what I was saying.
Tom is hesitating.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
️Don't use a pencil to write a letter.
You know where my key is?
I don't have any energy today.
Do you know who this manuscript is from?
Can you tell me when to turn off the machine?
The students were told to memorize the poem.

I'll fix it now.
They were tired of waiting.
Do what you want.
How old are you?
I study from eight to eleven.
Tatoeba

He keeps a diary.
She wears a brooch.
Ice becomes water when it melts.
He goes abroad every year.
The black one is mine.
Can I come back?
It's hot today.
I was born on March 23, 1969, in Barcelona.
Please write it here.
Don't tell anyone.
I think it's true.
She's my classmate.

All my friends love football.
There was a big gold star on the door.
You think he'll be here tomorrow?
Restaurant is awful.

Where did you find it, at school or at home?
Dry sand absorbs water.
Come here!
We are men.
When was the last time you saw him?
What do you want to be when you grow up?

This is the flag of Japan.
I'm a baker.
He left three days ago.
Whose books are these?
I can't live like this.
Where are you now?
I wish she'd come here tonight.
What are you going to tell Tom?
I got it!
I believe it will snow tomorrow.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Papa goes jogging every morning.
I'm gonna wash my hands.
The universe is full of secrets.
A cloud is a mass of vapor.
She's a selfish person.
Betty killed him.
Can I use a MasterCard?
Do you have a violin?
Is she Japanese?
He asked me for help.
"Why do you always lose only one sock of a pair?""If you lose both, you don't realize you've lost them"."Ah, of course"."

Yesterday was Sunday.
I went to the hospital to ask about his health.
He cried out for help.
He speaks French and English.
I can barely walk.
Tom closed his eyes.
Guess what happened to me.

He seems very stupid.
He's a wild one.
You live in Tokyo, right?
Tom organises a surprise party for Mary's birthday next week on Saturday.
He drank three bottles of beer.
"It looks like the typhoon is coming this way"."Yes. I just hope not that school is closed tomorrow"."
He gave the dog a bone.
He's not interested in art at all.

He's playing in his room.
There are instances where this rule does not apply.
He looked like a doctor.
I'm a vegetarian.
Don't open the door.
I got a letter from her.
What do you know about Tom?
Please wait for me.
We played hockey yesterday.
No, I didn't help.
Have you got time?
He didn't die for nothing.

I don't have enough RAM.
Look at the mountains covered in snow.
He'll be back in ten minutes.
It's a little cold.
Wang came to Japan to study Japanese.
Looks like it's gonna be a long day today.
Let me tell you about Japan.
The new medicine saved his life.
️School starts at 9:30.
A month is too little time.
I was used to the heat.
I'd rather go by plane.
You played tennis yesterday?
Even a child can understand it.
Only she can use the computer.
Tom is single.

Nice to meet you.
He leaves for Tokyo at 10:00.
What are you gonna use it for?
People always laugh at me when they find out I'm color blind.
In Europe, schools start in September.
I understand what she's saying.
I don't know.
I can't do that.
Optimists live longer.
Sam's already done his homework.

I plan to learn English.
That girl is handsome.
He says what he thinks.
Tom looks like his mother.
Don't say that's natural.
This is not the entrance.
Yeah, I know.
Let's play tennis!
Let's pretend to be soldiers.
I didn't know he was going to quit his job.
You like black cats?
Tom is single.
I'm free tonight.
He's blond.
Because he's so tall, I recognized him right away.
Please complete this form.
What is this noise?
You have more energy than I do.
During my pregnancy, I had blood poisoning.
I can't forgive him, just because he's a kid.
Have you finished your homework?
I'm going to school with him.
They're the same age.
Do you know why she's so angry?
Don't let go of the rope.
I'm planning on buying a watch for my son.
You don't have to tell your parents.
Please don't run into the classroom.
Tom is smart.

Look at that building.
I hear that song familiar.
You're not as small as me.
I want to see the movie.
You're going to junior high?
"Just whose books are these?""They're Alice's".
2, 4, 6 etc. are even numbers.
Please complete this form.
I'm going abroad.
What did you say?
That's his house.
His grandmother looks healthy.

How old is your dad?
Have you got a pencil?
Jane seems to have a new boyfriend.
It's very cold this morning.
What languages are spoken in Belgium?
I'm off on Sunday.

Thank you.
There were a lot of rotten apples in the basket.
Can you eat this?
You don't like me anymore?
️We couldn't see anything except fog.
I was scared, don't yell so suddenly.
He lived next door to his uncle.
His house is not far from here.

I came home last year and was surprised that the village and the people had changed completely.
The party was a huge success.
Shut up!
Ah, I can't wait for the summer vacation.
Recently, I feel like someone is following me all the time.
He's asleep?
Does he know you love him?

Let's try it.
Can I help you?
If you eat so much, you'll get a stomachache.
Which planet is closest to the sun?
There's a lift?
Papa painted the mailbox red.
You were in school then?
Nobody got up.
Help me!
It's raining!
A dog chases a cat, and the cat chases a mouse.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You live nearby?

How would you feel if someone did that to you?
She was sitting next to me.

I've learned a lot from his books.
Tom ran and ran until he finally saw the phone cell.
It won't be long before a warm spring comes.
Can you take care of my dog while I'm gone?
How was your trip?
A 90° angle is called a right angle.
Is that a cat or a dog?
His story sounds weird.
I moved last month.
We need your support.
As far as I know, she's still unmarried.
I almost left my umbrella on the train.
️Safe travel!
What is that?
I'm used to the noise.
They climbed Mount Fuji last week.
Generally speaking, children love sweetness.

Open the bottle.

A car lying on his side blocked further passage.

He became a pianist.
I'm staying with my uncle in Tokyo.
When I met him today, he asked me about my wife's condition.
Bus driver is responsible for the safety of his passengers.
Do you want another cup of tea?
Do you know who these people are?
I have a friend whose father is a veterinarian.
Tom did not agree.
Can this room be used for meetings?
You think he'll be here tomorrow?
My mom seldom watches TV at night.

There are things you'd rather not know.
It started raining.
Would you care to take care of my puppy while I'm gone?
Do you like black cats?
I didn't have time to eat.
He went into the room.
He visited Kyoto last year.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
What time is it?
-Honey, that's funny.
We're old friends.
What do you call this?
I'm not going back.
We import coffee from Brazil.
Tom has a low voice.
I'm gonna finish this job somehow.
No girl in my class is prettier than Linda.
Open your eyes.
You mean I have to kill Tom?
I saw him enter the room.
There are no fancy websites or good websites to download Japanese software?
There is a clear difference between these two.
Papa made me swim.
He died of oxygen deficiency.

The bathroom is free.
I can't explain it either.
I've been living in Tokyo since 1985.
We played football yesterday.
I didn't want to get up early.
Tom has long hair.
Have you got anything you wanna buy?
He took revenge.
arans are sweeter than lemons.

Yesterday it rained.
I'm sorry, too.
He works for a bank.
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
I have a friend in England.
I'm taking a vacation next month.
Close your eyes.

Please drop the papers at the entrance.
The boy grabbed the dog by the tail.
Why did you buy flowers?
You don't have a fever.
Why, what's wrong?
How many people have you told?
His brother was mean to me.
When I was almost ten, my parents gave me a chemistry set for Christmas.
She kissed him on the cheek.
I'm looking for someone who speaks Portuguese.
That hotel is on a hill.
He's my best friend.
He solved the problem on his own.
I saw it myself.
It's me!
I'm on a diet.
The accident happened the day before yesterday.
I'm a professor.

You did it on purpose!
️Please count the numbers.
Please speak as clearly as possible.
This is not an entrance.
"Say 'I love you' in French". "Je t'aime". "Thank you, I love you too".
Give me my money back!
Jane didn't play tennis, did she?
I don't like it either.
Oh, no!
The first step is always the hardest.
Can I take Tom?
Can we play together?
I tried to shut down the traffic noise.
Translate this into French, please.
Gold is heavier than iron.
A guard was standing with his legs crossed.
Tulips are in full bloom now.
I don't think she looks like her mother.
In the eyes of God, all men are equal.
"He's coming?" "No, I don't think he is".
The new plan worked.

Mary can speak Japanese.
Ken talks like he knows everything.
Now we're finally together.
I wish we had a car.
Please come in.
I decided to learn Esperanto today.
He's blond.
And you?
What was the best movie you saw this year?
How did you make money in Tokyo?
My sister has a job.
This is a book.
Yes, I did.
He has a son named Johano.
Sooner or later he'll regret it.
How old is Tom?
He solved that problem easily.
I don't like the way he talks.
I'm from Singapore.
I'm glad you could understand my broken English.

Do you like Tom?
Mari what bought yesterday?
What kind of person is Tom?
Always keep a handkerchief in your pocket.
I'd rather you come with me.
Tom showed me Mary's letter.
I'm reading this book.
I'll help you as much as I can.
3 to 1 is unfair.
I hope you can come by again.
️Mexico was not yet independent of Spain.
I always want to read that book.

Don't tell Tom about it.
The boy has never been to the zoo.
He went to the United States last week.

The big fish eats the small fish.
How can we make a difference in the world?
I was taking a shower.
Can I sit here?
He promised me he'd come here.
I find this novel boring.
I have something to tell you.

What time is it at your place?
The sun is an eternal source of light, heat and life.
I don't have the address now.
I've spoken to this student.
I have to look for my pen.
He hit me wrong.
Sometimes I run out of my office for coffee.
Japan and the United States became friendly countries.
They were already married.
I was home.
I wanted to buy the book, but I noticed that I didn't have more than 200 yen with me.
He's still mad.

Tom cannot read without glasses.
Tom played the oboe and Maria accompanied him on the piano.
And I know you didn't do it for me.
I ran into him.
Tom is afraid of the dark.
What was that sound?
Galaxia
She tore the letter to pieces.
The stars were not visible in the sky.
Santa Claus is just your dad, isn't he?
I'll show you the city.
We waited a long time, but he didn't come.
I want to know more about your country.
Have you got plans for tonight?
Get a little slower.
I'll wait for you at the station tomorrow morning.

You got earplugs?
I'm planning on buying a watch for my son.
I have to visit my friend in the hospital.
There are many wide streets in the city.
Are there processing costs?
I'm in pain right here.
That's my dictionary.
There was plenty of time to talk to friends.
Why do you want to pay for school yourself when your parents are willing to support you financially?
I think Tom is in a mood.
Leave it closed.
I'm studying abroad.
I haven't collected enough material to write a book yet.
Tom talks a lot on the phone.
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
He loves to travel.
I'm uncomfortable with everything I do, and people say I'm slow to understand.
I'm not in such a hurry.
Fred wrote his mother a long letter.

I went to the movies with my brother.
I fell asleep.
We went skiing in Canada.
Are you tired?
Get in, it's cold outside.
Can you Skype me tonight?

I'm in the car.
Tom seems busy?

We have plenty of time.
I'm getting caught up in the education of this world.
There's something in your hair.
I live in Hyogo.
"You're just pretending to be sleeping, aren't you, Tom?" "No, I'm sleeping"."Those sleeping people don't answer, do they?"
He died at the age of seventy.
Tom has some friends in Boston.
Go to the bathroom!
Whose glass is this?
I can talk about anything with my best friend.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I happened to see your mother in the library.
There are no chairs in this room.
He wiped the sweat off his face.
She drove the car into the garage.
I wanna go to bed early today.
It was very painful.
Did you understand what he said?
I went swimming in the river yesterday.
Tell me how to play the game.
I have 13 cats.
What language do people speak in America?
He loves science fiction.
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
I need a knife.
I'll ask Tom about it.
What are you doing?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Now that you've said it, have you found the umbrella you said you lost the other day?
Is that right?
I quit smoking and drinking.
We all got in the car.
"Ken is busy?""Yes".
Do you know what time the store closes?
Imports were higher than exports last year.
Can I ask how old you are?
Bye, Sayoko
Tom, phone for you!
It's me!

My sister's playing with a doll.
Can you lend me your dictionary?
I'll call you at 7:00.
"What a cute puppy. Why is it called a panda?" "Because its face looks like a panda".
Suddenly it started raining.
It's gonna take five years for the technology to get this far.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I went into the coffee house.
You drew this yourself?
I met Ken yesterday.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
How hot is it today, huh?
It's the first time I've heard this word.
He's one of my best friends.

I was awake at the time.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
I didn't go to school at all yesterday.
He went to America last week.
He's already gone.
That's enough for today.
Get in your seats, ready, off!
Instead of cotton, we planted peanuts.
Your purse is open.
She says she likes flowers.
I'm ready to go.

Yesterday it was cloudy.
He lied.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The city provided the victims of the earthquake with food and blankets.
Long players have an advantage in basketball.
The match ended in a draw.
The room of Mr. Johnson was a large room.
She was all dressed in black.
Calm down.
He broke the window on purpose.
Do you know Tom's real name?
What time did you go to bed last night?
What's your name?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm glad your cold's over.
He asked for my advice.
She cried all night.
They asked me for a drink.
Tom wrote Mary a letter.

I think Yumi is sick.
I'm on the phone.
Hurry up!
Listen to what I'm saying.
Doesn't she know your phone number?
Can I tell Tom?
Did you call me last night?
I'm going to look into it.
I'll send you a copy of this image as soon as possible.
You've lost weight, haven't you?
Don't hate me!

There are many parks in London.
You're behaving yourself in a way that's not good to talk about.
You'd better go.
What's your favorite vegetable?
I bought something unnecessary again.
When you fall asleep, you should say it.
I saw a bird flying through the air.
Do you speak French?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

She had a strange dream.
He's almost always home.
Her father is a cop.
Leave that to me.

Are you a doctor?
If you don't behave, Santa won't show.

You don't have to worry about that.
I was glad we could talk again a long time ago.
I met her on the street.
I want brown shoes, not black.

The impact of television on society is great.
I'm ashamed of myself.
You were tired last night?
What a big dog!
I don't have as much money as he does.
I said I'm sorry.
I don't understand Dutch. It's hard.
As you know, perseverance is the key to success.
Look at a cat in the kitchen!
He's running fast.
Are you mad?
I'm playing tennis this afternoon.
A few girls were playing tennis.
He's afraid of making mistakes.

You must protect your family.
Come the day after tomorrow.
How stupid am I to believe him!
A good start is half the job.
Long time not seen.
He got into bad company.
What are you talking about?
Bill was in Japan.
When is the new magazine coming out?
He speaks ten languages.
He'll probably be back in a minute.
He's her boyfriend.
Can I have tea?
Are you Japanese?
Maybe he was sick.
I'm a member of the basketball team.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Verbs have impermanent verbs that cannot have a suffering object, and transitional verbs that can have a suffering object.
Hurry up, you'll be in time for school.
You know the movie Avatar?
You must promise me something.
It takes a long time to finish this job.
Tom has high blood pressure.
Tom has a bad reputation.

The boy is very honest.
When the tempura I make cools it's soft, and it's not that good.
She kissed me on the cheek and said good night.
Look at the red-roofed house.
You're lying, aren't you?
I am neither rich nor do I want to be rich.
I'm gonna take a bath first.
This summer I went to Nikkō and stayed there for one night.
They eat a lot of rice.
He climbed Mount Fuji.
Where'd you go?
Satoko asked her friends to come to her party.
I was afraid you had failed.
He stayed here for a while.
What did you do with Christmas last year?
How am I supposed to eat this?
We held our breath and waited for the results of the experiment.
I don't want sugar.
I'm not like you.
We want whole sentences.
Tom returns home alone.
This book is Tony's.
She killed him with a knife.
She said she showered every morning.
