28-year-old chef found dead in a convenience store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local grocery store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who might want to hurt him, adding: "He's finally starting to get better".
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department says it's a violent death and an ongoing investigation.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked and devastated by his death.
"We have a small team working as a close-knit family.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially slept in the dorms, but that recently he was finally starting to get better.
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his little brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to reunite with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner, said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be part of any argument.
He was a brother who took things for what they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a diamond in the rough that shone every day", he said.

The Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernisation.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state transport company has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the modernisation costs are gradually decreasing in each year except 2012.
The Czech Railways have invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernisation over the last six years.
A third of the cars are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of locomotives and separate units by two years and of classic wagons by six years.
The majority of the investments were made by the carrier in regional transport, where around 60% of the funds were allocated, and 40% were invested in the renewal of long-distance transport vehicles.
The average age of the locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, older vehicles upgraded are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If the vehicle upgrades were not taken into account, the average age of Czech vehicles would increase by 10 years.
The average age of passenger cars is slightly older, at 23 years, when modernisation is included.
If only the age from the date of manufacture is taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, the classic sets of wagons and locomotives have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and world railways and are being replaced by motorized or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives fell from 280 to 223 and the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier disposed in particular of old vehicles fitted with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the journey.
Between January and July, he had 110 of these cars scrapped by a hauler.
The investments that ČD plans to make in the near future in the fleet include, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 km/h which the carrier plans to deploy on the international Prague - Bratislava - Budapest route or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic high-speed line.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities have been aware of illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial board of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Czechia that is now attracting motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a tourist-friendly walk in the canopy of trees, but also the Olympic Park.
The DMV knows it's a black site, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of these ads all over the country.
Officials say the problem is a flimsy law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
It's a complicated bureaucratic cycle.
But in the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short.
Or you can just move the ad a few feet and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main line from České Budějovice to Lipno, there is a black billboard on our property by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structure with the giant billboard.
Like no one cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter safety zone where nothing can stand for safety.
The highway patrol says they can't handle the billboard because of the holes in the law.
Maybe load it up and drive it away.
"We cannot afford to do this", says Nina Ledvin, spokeswoman for the Directorate of Roads and Highways, referring to the complex bureaucratic cycle that removing the billboard must by law prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate the online daily Aktuálně.cz began to monitor in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities are unable to solve effectively and quickly.
In the south of the Czech Republic alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed illegally next to or near a road.
Similarly, other counties are in the same situation.
"We have trouble getting companies to remove the leaflets", says the head of the transport department at the Český Budějovice regional office, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klasa, the fault lies in the holes in the law that bind officials.
First, they have to make a difficult appeal to the owner of the billboard to remove the ad.
But company heads are often out of reach or familiar with a trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when it started to take a more detailed interest in the issue: just move the mobile advert stand a few meters and officials can throw away the previous call to remove the black ad.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly don't match, it's seen as a new device and we have to contact the owner again", explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law that will ban billboards on freeways and restrict them to Class I roads from September next year could make a difference.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same.
And the authorities are not relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of dollars a year on illegal land leases and no one can touch them.
For example, a billboard that appeals to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech building district court is currently conducting three administrative proceedings against her for black billboards.
The company faces a fine of 30,000 in each case.
These are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the protected zone of a class I road.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czech Budapest Magistrates' Court.
The advertising that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet among these cases, but will probably be soon.
According to the spokeswoman of the RSFSR Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls to remove, and the case will be on the table of regional and then probably magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of the companies that we can't get in touch with.
She doesn't take mail and her official residence on Žižkov was canceled over six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to a South Czech businessman, Anton Fischer, who famously had a bitter dispute with the head of the Hyundai Czech representation.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has, however, in the past denied any connection.
This spring, when the Socialist Party of Germany, at the initiative of Aktuálne.cz, became interested in advertising Lipno, Fischer had government officials send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his boarding house, where the new company is supposedly based.
But no one has called the highway patrol from that address.
It was a wasted fight.
Similar silences or opaque residency changes are not uncommon.
We gave a company a fine of two million crowns in stages a few years ago.
But she changed the name and the I.C.O. and there was nothing to do.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads continued, maybe in other places.
We're pretty helpless against companies like this and their business practices.
It's like a windmill fight, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet discussed the amendment to the law in this regard.
Aktuality.cz spoke to several MPs who were interested in the issue.
But so far, they haven't developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech roads.
The government denied it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for not only national but also local and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restriction, on the other hand, they need them for their own advertising in the election campaigns.
I don't subscribe to the fairly established notion that when something doesn't work, you need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year but more rapeseed and poppy, statistics show.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year's harvest is above the average of the last five to ten years.
The yield of rapeseed (3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The original estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a decline of one tenth from last year.
But last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's harvest is above the average of the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, this year's harvest of rapeseed and poppy is expected to be higher.
The beet harvest is up 3.9 percent from last year, when it was 1,256 million tons.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The projected decline in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent decrease in yield per hectare to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the area under sowing.
Farmers have ploughed three percent less land this year.
The harvest of winter wheat, the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is expected to be 3.3 percent lower this year.
Farmers spread it over several fields.
However, a decrease in yield per hectare will be a sign of a decrease to 6.04 tonnes.
Statistics suggest a decline of about one fifth for spring barley, the most commonly used for beer.
The result is a 15.2 percent reduction in planting areas and a lower yield per hectare.
In contrast, winter barley yields are up 6.3 percent.
Let the harvest of wheat also increase.
The rapeseed harvest is estimated at 1.305 million tons, an increase from last year.
The area under cultivation increased by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's canola crop is 13.3 percent above the 10-year average, and the area planted is one third larger than it was ten years ago.
Poppy fields have also increased in the last four years.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 acres.
But the Czech Republic's poplar crop area is half that of 2008, when it was a record 70,000 hectares.
The increase in planting areas will make this year's poppy harvest richer.
It's up 2.5 percent from last year's figure of 27,423 tons.
But the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in central Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they inflicted cutting and slashing injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment", police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both of the obvious perpetrators were apprehended by police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion for their removal and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to 10 years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in central Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The assailants inflicted cutting and slashing wounds, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that occurred just after noon on Tuesday on Liberty Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators were taken into custody, said Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Strbáková.
A mass fight between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two assailants attacked the 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the attacked man tried to flee, he was wounded by slashes and cuts that required hospitalization and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The riot, which caused much attention in the city center and involved the intervention of several police patrols and officers, involved family disputes.
Criminal investigators have charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted aggravated assault and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion to detain them and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was used in a mass fight in the center of Olomouc five years ago, just a few dozen meters away, in front of the Varna disco on Riegrova Street.
Police said that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked guests standing outside the restaurant.
Police say they were carrying knives, batons and machetes.
The court then sentenced the two foreigners to probation.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'd be surprised, maybe you walk past them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovažný Square.
It was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That there's a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected ones?
In the very centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several tenement houses that, despite their location, size and often even monumental protection, are empty and empty.
The properties in the centre were selected using the project VacancyDom.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Homes are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque corporate relationships, or ownership by a state that cannot or will not dispose of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, I want initiative
Fidel Castro almost got shot here. Hitler's brother lived here.
The writers showed a different Little Side.
Shopping apocalypse.
The malls in the U.S. are empty.
A walk through Prague Unknown.
Karlin was a luxury suburb.
The layout is reminiscent of New York's Manhattan, the architect says.
The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
They donated over a million dollars to Clinton's charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is from their speeches.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is from their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed the Clintons paid 34.2 percent federal income tax last year, and then state and local income taxes of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump has a problem with a similar move, not having released his tax returns yet.
There is a strong possibility that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after her admission was released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy around Trump's income, in part to cast doubt on whether her rival is as wealthy as he claims, the AP reported.
Trump's net worth is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
A lower salary would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running with the former first lady for vice president, today released his tax returns for the past 10 years.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their income to charity and contributed 25.6 percent of their income to tax last year.
There's been another outbreak of polio in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists have been preventing vaccination and killing doctors.
In Nigeria, polio cases have reappeared.
In the northeast, the government has declared an emergency vaccination program after two children infected with the disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines were flown in by helicopter.
The area was also the site of attacks by Islamist terrorists, Boko Haram, who prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization, the virus was circulating unnoticed.
In northeastern Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination campaign is being launched after two children were paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno State and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday reportedly rushed polio vaccines to the stricken northeast of the country, where Islamist terrorists Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years unnoticed.
Boko Haram extremists have in the past opposed vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children were found to have polio on Thursday.
Both affected children came with refugees from the part of Nigeria recently liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO's polio eradication unit, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
The Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno State.
The area was only opened to international organizations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in that part of the country.
Nigeria's Health Minister, Isaac Adewole, admitted that new cases of polio are a major disappointment for the country, which was planning to declare polio eradicated next year.
The WHO warned that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it might have spread among children.
Children under five years of age will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
While in 1988 polio was found in 125 countries, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the touching stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a pimp gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed by police from the power of a pimp gang.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the touching stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, said a Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to brutal physical abuse during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
Francis' visit was to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a greater fight against it, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often points to the plight of the marginalized.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who had arrived in the Vatican in April and June of this year at his personal invitation.
France will strike at the jihadist factories.
But it won't be possible without the help of the Muslims.
France needs Muslims to help her fight radical Islam.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is planning major changes to the operation of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we've closed 20 mosques and prayer houses.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary has announced.
There are over 100 jihadist factories operating in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom of religion", Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for new mosques comes from abroad, with the largest coming from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf countries.
Even this leads to the presence of preachers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy", the prime minister added.
The key to achieving these aims will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The country now has the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The foundation was already intended to contribute to transparency in the financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction.
But the institution was soon beset by internal strife and rivalry.
"It's a total failure", Valls said recently.
The French political scene has been heating up since the January 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, when a debate erupted over a new institution to replace the now-defunct foundation.
All of this has precipitated further terrorist attacks in France by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be established in October of this year.
It will have two main functions - to provide funding for mosques from domestic resources and also to supervise the imams.
It is not yet clear where he will get the money not only to build new mosques but also various educational centers.
But a few suggestions are being considered.
One of them is a special tax or tax on halal food.
This is what halal food vendors would actually pay for certification.
Some of that money would go directly to the foundation's coffers.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros ($1 to $2) could then be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Each year, some 30,000 people make the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the prime minister, in the future only preachers who have undergone special training programs at French universities should serve in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
The French government is simultaneously campaigning against radicals.
And more will follow, the Home Secretary announced recently.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering dozens more.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly affect the fight against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, but young people are being radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
The racer Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Bauge.
To advance to the round of 16, a Czech track cyclist must compete in a repair race.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio Olympics after advancing from the sprint qualifying round to the top 18 has lost in the first round to French giant Gregory Bauge, the defending silver medalist from the previous London Games.
They're gonna have to fight for the eighth-place finish in the practice.
27 riders took part in the start of the Royal Race and the best Czech rider of the day recorded the fourteenth best time.
He's done the 200th lap in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was waiting for the fifth Bauge in qualifying, who already has Rio bronze in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen finally lashed out at the experienced Frenchman, he was careful.
A great performance by gold-medal defender Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton ran the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualifying heat in Olympic record time of 9.551.
He also easily dealt with the last advancing German, Maximilian Levy, as expected.
The British quartet, led by Bradley Wiggins, set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km pursuit and advanced to the final.
The previous record of 3:51.659, which had been held by the British four years before the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing for a fresh start in the field.
Representatives of the young doctors have met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Young Doctors' Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the whole council to support further sectoral events from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues surrounding the contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chair Ellen McCourt said the government remained "silent on questions" leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: In this light, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new treaty entirely and to request a new formal discussion on all matters.
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve an ongoing program of intense industry events beginning in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to go on strike this year, including the first general strike in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the young doctors in the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told the BMA members at their pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be passed.
After the vote, the health secretary said the contract would be a burden on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of "incompatibles"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally announce the end of an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the lavish hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I got the impression that Ankara wanted to desire this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his "dear friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the lingering coldness that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was furious.
Putin was beating around the bush and accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks were behind everything.
More serious were accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But an official message came from St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed some kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan was almost removed from power last month in a failed coup and he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him too.
There's also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - notably the cancellation of charter flights that bring several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coast every year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely rest when flights resume.
They make money off of Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables once agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed to be imported again.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here, as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility has dragged on the EU accession talks and the accession of Putin - who is eager to use the cooling to break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from elected officials after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as "an alliance of incompatibles": how two countries that feel rejected and used by the West are joining forces.
But despite their public demonstration of reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently put itself in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
After almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not even discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries can find a common voice on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane - it's certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is to be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
She took a break from it when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, strategic brands used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
Millions of pounds were spent on sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winblem Champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers but will not open new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except for the head office and stock exchange code, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are coming into the spotlight -- Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our visits to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, we had McEwan answer questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investment brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank".
As the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestically focused efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of individual brands for sponsorship of the sport.
The time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (that we are asking ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for our customers? said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say we're going to be a great bank for customers and introduce these brands.
But with the way we've been focusing on the needs of the customers rather than our own, I think a lot of changes are happening.
We can remind these marks again, I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on the Predilection horse has led the 3,000th winner to the finish line.
Dettori splashes champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second win of the evening at his local track, riding a Predilection horse trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this in the flat.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time harness champion Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar, said: "It's strange".
I'm very touched because my family is here too.
I'm extremely glad this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings back the Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in the hurdles - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has finished with record-breaking 4,300 wins during his career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins in his career
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of the modern era, and it's no surprise that he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical finesse that sets him apart from the rest of the riders in the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just race on the weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners already!
But the truth is, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's something.
He's got a lively nature, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous high jump
From the high jump to the long jump, Frankie Dettori has been the British flat racing messenger for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He won countless major races, including his famous Grand Slam of Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned for doping.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when he returned from a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and despite all the doubters, he returned in top form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin fired the head of the presidential office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from his post as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had relieved Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential office, but did not give a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vajna was a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
According to the website (in Russian), he later served as Head of Presidential Protocol and Presidential Office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust".
I believe the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to step down and recommended that he replace him with Vajna.
Will smiling convince you?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's longtime closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on state television, both men announced that they were stepping down as chief of staff at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras have only convinced a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is it a result of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once considered a potential president suddenly desires to lead Russia's environmental policy has met with great distrust.
The Kremlin website quotes comments addressed to Putin in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding, even problematic, post for four years.
Apparently, I was chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest aides.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov might become Putin's successor as head of state after his second term, as a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But that post was taken by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of the TV series Criminal Minds, was fired after he hit a director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of opinions on stage in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC and CBS television networks that produce the series announced in a joint statement that it was being released.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences on stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened", he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, will be released at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who rose to fame starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been with the show since its first series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last 12 years putting my heart and soul into it", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I hoped to be in it until the end, but that's not possible now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and most of all, the amazing fans this show could ever hope for.
The show is expected to return for a twelfth season on September 28.
In Banff , fish mysteriously landed in a garden
A man in the small town of Banff asked for help identifying fish that had appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may be sand eels left behind by the water snake.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short video of his find on Periscope, hoping that someone might help him to explain how the two-inch [5 cm] fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north platform with the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - a bridge that now connects Fife.
It is the first of four interlocking platforms that are now almost complete around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was among the first to arrive from the mainland on the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how civil engineers used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel on a truly impressive scale to construct this section of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the embankment between the viaduct and the bridge deck was a delicate operation that required extreme precision.
Over 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being poured at Rosytha, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first stop on the construction of any bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of earthworks.
After installing the last section of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - toward the mainland.
We did this by extending the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled with a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team was working with were very small -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after being washed away from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre Lifeboat Station RNLI issued an alert Friday at 13:20 BST after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling close by and we thought the worst", said Moelfre lifeboat's helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds carried it away before we could set off", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man in his 60s was found without a life jacket, exhausted, holding on to buoys.
All were transferred aboard a shore-based lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a cord for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was steering the boat when it capsized.
Someone upstairs was holding a protective hand over those boys.
The judge refuses to take the case because of the Lullaby's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who were allegedly to get political traffic from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chief of staff Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, it was about approving the tax package.
Schneider, Fuks and Fuchs made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared in positions of influence in state-owned companies.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, they were wrongfully convicted and were awarded a total of almost 2 million crowns.
The deaf man is now testifying in the case, after the Supreme Court intervened.
His wife works in the courthouse at the Fruit Market, settling civil cases.
However, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another court in Prague.
The Queen has already twice absolved Jan Nečasova, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to spy on Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Deaf wasn't in the picture.
But according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily overreaction.
I don't think impartiality can be interpreted in this way to exclude a trial if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in the courtroom.
I'm afraid there's no way to judge anything, he wrote in his diary.
"It seems to me to be a slippery slope", he added.
Roman Bocek, a former civil servant, is also accused in the political trafficking case.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
The Prague 1 District Court heard the indictment of former Prime Minister Petar Nečas's chief of staff Jana Nagy (now Nečasové) and other defendants in the case of misuse of military intelligence on 13 June.
In this video, Timeless is coming into court with her husband.
The Deaf woman was supposed to handle the Pencil statements.
The wife of the ex-president was to judge, for example, the statements of President Milos Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an Allied air strike.
She flew to Syria with two girlfriends her own age from London Gatwick Airport last February.
The Home Office has not commented on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who ran away from home were being smuggled into Syria across the Turkish border, police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly heading to visit their other former classmate from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge stir and also strained relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined IS radicals and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job with a salary of a hundred thousand.
A high-paying job that doesn't even require a college degree.
That's what it looks like at first glance.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180,000 working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that there is a shortage of almost 20 000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after jobs are among programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists, according to Grafton's staffing statistics.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
So it is not the candidates who compete for the job, but the job for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a requirement.
A college education is not a requirement for the elderly.
A university degree means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of an applicant's intelligence and learning ability, but often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which a college degree cannot replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He makes the most money in Prague.
The wages of the Irish are well above the national average.
The biggest money comes from Prague and Brno, but in the regions it's not so popular anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague", confirms Kubačka.
The highest paid are the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can get up to CZK 120 000 - 180 000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn between CZK 60,000 and CZK 100,000 when they start.
It's a fight for graduates, too.
While some professions often require graduates to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case with IT professionals.
Because if companies go out of their way to overpay a professional from another company, they're more likely to reach out to a graduate.
They can raise him their own way.
They can't live without their tongues.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but a minimum of decent English is required for the Irish.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a requirement for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a lot of cases where companies are looking for a person with a high level of education and experience and are satisfied with only average English.
However, if a support worker, for example, speaks several foreign languages, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the head of Kubačka.
Yeah, Google it, that's where heaven is.
Czech workers can only envy Google employees.
Flexible working hours, homework, and part-time work are natural for them, and not just for mothers.
"Newlywed fathers are given an extra four weeks of leave after the birth of their baby", says Martina Jonek, a Google spokeswoman.
Petting also includes health care for employees and their families, food, transport, training, wellness or massage in the workplace.
If you want to learn, you're green, and it doesn't matter what you want to learn.
But that's not the end of the benefits.
A full freezer like that is definitely not for throwing away.
A healthy lunch (including breakfast and dinner in some localities) is available on site every day.
In addition, all offices have so-called micro-kitchens, where people can always find a healthy snack, the spokesman reveals.
And to avoid any waste, he puts what he doesn't eat in boxes for the employees to take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages for Czech conditions?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not the eight-hour workday that is important, but the results of initiatives or projects, progress or development, ideas and innovative solutions", the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to witness the public support of prominent and influential public figures for criminal armed groups who brazenly pursue refugees on the Bulgarian-Turkish border".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested", Zeid stressed.
And what's worse, they're often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared with 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - The Pursuit of Health and Happiness That Pays
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people have complained over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend their leisure time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off their couches and leads them to activity.
Screen time has been reduced, first by TV, then by video games, and most recently by smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking about the fashion, of course, which is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the new game was launched in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to the huge demand that led to server overload.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder in a matter of days and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, gamers on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via screenshot on the phone) or "catch" them.
Mania has taken over a generation that, at a younger age, played the game, got up from their seats and drove out to look for Pokémon.
In the United States, this game has led to a dramatic increase in the number of steps the average person takes each day.
Apple's Cardiogram smartphone app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people who watched it exercise for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't have information about who's playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns that try to get people to "get 30", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and targeted at people who don't look good.
Still, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer and depression.
Physical activity helps control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and entertainment.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for pokemon.
Of course, there are also some boring patrons who look for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk through the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At one time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything like this game.
You see a new thing and interest in it starts to fade at some point.
But with the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and VR with real-world activity to help many people in their pursuit of activity, health and fitness.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the plant.
When the free people were there, they were all dumb.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the long jump on Thursday, beating the rest of the field in the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and final five team member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) performs on the podium at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the final of the individual all-around competition in gymnastics.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win a multiple, and fifth overall, as she cemented her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears came to her face.
This achievement puts her in the same league of rare athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning lineups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the riders, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals in the women's singles finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won her first on Tuesday, when she was a cheerleader at the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyiova.
Biles insists that during her long climb to the top she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in simple - the one that includes her signature triple salto with double reversal - is set to Latin music that would be right at home, in the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents when she was a toddler and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
She hasn't lost a competition in the triple jump since the summer of 2013 - a winning streak that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took the lead for a short time with two turns, it was only an illusion.
The cottage and the basement - where Biles is defending the world championship - are waiting.
She's back in the lead with 15,433 points on the block and finished with 15,933 on the singles.
Raisman gave her a gentle hug as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the sparkling red, white and blue shades, Biles' tears appeared as a wish she had written in her diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafina, but then she won bronze for the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Granny", was way ahead.
She sent a crowd of air kisses to her bachelors, overcome by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, a post this week by the 19-year-old athlete on Twitter, which became a smash hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police say three victims in a serial killer's case were shot while listening to music in their car.
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the most significant attack of the decade in the case of Phoenix's first serial killer, shot while sitting in their car talking and listening to music.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The report said the gunman stood on the side of a passenger and fired eight rounds from a handgun before fleeing in another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide is not a robbery because the assailant did not take the wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators are working to determine if the shooting was connected to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
"It's happening in the mansion district outside the house", Howard told CBS's KPHO affiliate earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect drove several vehicles, including a brown late-1990s Nissan, a black late-1990s BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were connected and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital, where she later died from her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just 30 minutes before the triple homicide, which police believe was the work of this serial killer.
Forensics found the casing and put together the bullet residue from the seat and under the hood.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves to sing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for that, she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing that anymore", explains Picciut.
Edmund walks with a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still can't talk.
But some milestones are already being slowly reached.
He walks with a helper and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is performing a sign language in which Edmund says "Please sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not ordinary sign language - he says Edmund made up some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different conditions: genetic, as in Edmund's case, and infections during pregnancy caused by viruses, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to tell what impact Zika will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut is like an emotional tax that is chosen by an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
I never actually asked what the overall prognosis was because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciut has some encouraging news for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know, it's for the best.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding called for rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi will overflow their banks, threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness said they're receiving requests for watercraft, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood watch will remain in effect throughout most of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said that another 8 to 13 centimeters of rain could fall over the sea.
In South Alabama, flood watch was on standby Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are forecast to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood a number of homes in the Baton Rouge suburbs.
He added that the danger is flooding downstream in Ascension County, where these runoff streams will only slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9 a.m. local time Friday.
Rescue teams are still pulling people out of the tidal waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued from Gloucester earlier Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming", Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
His wife says it's the highest level she's seen on the river in 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and took them to a Gloucester fire station, where they remained hidden Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the flooding is spreading rapidly and authorities are considering evacuations.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Liviston reported 12 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil's been soaking up since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and toll roads forced residents to evacuate their homes in Tangipahoa County and cancelled classes in five school districts.
CBS's WWL reported that an elder in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters were set up in Amite and Hammond for those who had been evacuated.
"They'll be able to return home when the water recedes", he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of flooding, and residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the floodwaters.
"The last major flooding we had was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the Persian Gulf coast continues to experience persistent rain.
He said that a couple of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but by Friday, none of them were on the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still there".
Mahaj Brown, 6 - Boy shot like a log, survived shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The boy's grandparents say he suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the waist, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious on the way to the hospital.
"He's been hit pretty bad, his little body was shot like a piece of wood", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this is happening.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be fine.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two other victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, a child was found shot in the front seat of a vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators with CBS Philadelphia say there was a possible shootout between several gunmen.
The site was found to contain cartridges from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons.
It seems to have been a battle that was definitely ongoing.
There were shell casings on both sides of the street.
So it appears there were several armed combatants who were actively involved, Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing video footage.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray bullet Tuesday outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's exactly how I envision the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, and for a couple of reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been this dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is made up of Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, a Catholic.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing the pinnacle of sports, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the Olympic team the same way Aly and Madison did.
They're the final five because the gymnastics team for the next Olympics will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will be coaching.
The reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their dependents and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in wealthy suburban areas that can support activities.
These clubs provide gymnasts with all the training they need and are a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez' coach, both coached athletes when they first started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 young people within the city (mostly black and Hispanic) and we've trained national and international champions.
In September, we'll expand to Detroit, where we'll provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination translates into lifelong benefits for good health, academic and workplace achievement.
It's the inspiration that this team will send to us, thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participating in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating your girl power and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for inspiring so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong, successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal , the young doctors are ready to go on strike .
Ministers hoped that a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in no-man's-land and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working procedures to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and thus fair treatment for all doctors.
With only eight weeks before the first group of doctors will be under contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to engage and often deafening silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the option is still open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors.
If that doesn't happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next step.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to replace doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that disagreements on the changes would be resolved after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher pay for weekend work for the 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers' association, has urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "The workforce action will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overloaded teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been talking to a board of young doctors, and together with the Department of Health and the others, we've responded positively to their concerns about the role of oversight and whistleblower.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, school leave and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about $1.50 (U.S.) and is recommended to be given to more patients over a longer period.
The anticoagulant Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a second attack in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends it be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of those will have another attack or heart attack.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat accumulation on the walls of arteries, which forms a continuous layer.
If this layer is torn, a blood clot may form, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can travel further down the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is made by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to occur.
The draft NICE Directive published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments, there is still a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the initial recommendation of Ticagrelor we can extend the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the design.
With the computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a general oversight of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Former Home Secretary Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse because of "ethnic and religious sensitivity".
The former community secretary, now head of the anti-corruption task force, said that intimidating voters based on their religion was so bad that police should put up cordoned off polling stations and protect alert voters.
He recommended that voters bring their identification cards with them so they can prove who they are in the polls.
Currently, all voters need to do is provide their name and address.
The report also suggests that people apply indelible ink to their fingers when casting their vote to prevent voters from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for greater access for the press to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
It is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also protecting local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud environment that goes hand in hand with it, he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, west London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city's incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had cynically harmed the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, where a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote - which allegedly involved senior members of the Muslim community pressuring people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the video, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting an identity card
Its report states: Evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, particularly in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
There were concerns that... the state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of "politically correct" over-sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating the mail vote to prevent voter fraud.
The report, now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous controls on registrations to prevent voter registration being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider requiring voters to present identification before voting.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implement systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Restrict requests for automatic voting by correspondence to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from tampering with votes cast by mail and ballot envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create a cordon around the polling stations.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute people who use illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
To ban the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen (except Wales) to work in polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff adhere to the rule of individual voter access to polling stations.
Sir Eric is critical of the London Police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The court of election issues has dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
He was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for a number of reasons - the strength of the evidence of a crime.
He also criticises the ineffective checks on checkboxes in the voter registration departments at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's decision of the court in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but a disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and a state of denial by some authorities are threatening that reputation.
The madness of cycling double Duchess Kate and other celebrities double at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been going crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete in this year's gold-medal race to boast a celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
As prey: American archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Next to Kate's twin on the bike path, a number of people online were quick to point out that a certain archer might be the twin of the star of Leonard DiCaprio.
US archery champion Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter storm after images surfaced of him strikingly resembling a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he'd heard about his resemblance to Leo since he was a kid.
"They don't see much of a similarity, except maybe a beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's cool and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be made even more striking this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when it comes to swimming pools, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell-O's Matthew Morrison for years.
And for the record, the user thinks Nathan is the athletic version of the actor from Inception.
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimov not only boasts the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, but Nathan Adrian of Team USA, who fans say looks like an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitte.
Interesting women: soccer star Hope Sol (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not just one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarity
On the theory waves: according to this user there may be a reason for the similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
Soccer star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredible resemblance in face and eye shape.
Other favorite comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, boasting a beautifully wide smile that seems to mimic that of Gabrielle Union, star of Bravo, Girls!
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimsuit "exploded"
Viewers of Wednesday's CBC live broadcast of the Olympics were outraged by commentator Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance as she finished fourth in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "dragging like a stinker" during the race and "exploded".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to vent his opinions at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things, "That little 14-year-old girl from China gave up, you fool".
She was over-excited, she was pulling like a stink, she exploded.
Thank you, man.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished second in the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck - and allowed the Canadians to overtake China.
Viewers in Canada quickly started to respond online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC anchorman said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "exploded"????
That idiot didn't even know it was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool".
Byron MacDonald's Twitter criticism came from all sides and many called for his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists. #disgust.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary, saying, "We apologize for the swimmer's performance commentary that leaked into the broadcast".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened.
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-host Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to over 90 Twitter users who complained about commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
He sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, should not have been aired.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television, trying to explain his remark by saying he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay", he said on the CBC broadcast of the Olympics.
I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer person.
Needless to say, I meant no disrespect and I'm very sorry.
Customers at Primark are outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store.
When a woman stripped to try on her panties at a shopping plaza in the middle of Primark, shoppers were unsure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried on a size fit, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, and finally tried on four pairs of panties at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said the mystery woman had tried on her underwear, then got dressed again and left the store without buying anything.
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own stockings and panties and put them on.
She didn't even try to find a discreet spot - she just stood there, impudent as a monkey.
Everyone just watched her take her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.
She did the same thing to three other girls before finally deciding she didn't like anything, got dressed again, and left.
She didn't seem to care who was watching - or even think about the person who might buy the panties she was trying on.
Ms. Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home a pair of panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them is disgusting".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I was collecting things that she was obviously trying to take off the market - which is also the only right thing to do".
I would be terrified to think of bringing home new panties and finding out that another woman had them on, took them off, and they hadn't been washed.
A Primark store spokesman said: "Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9".
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a weapon attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a bully, whether he's approaching from the front or from behind.
If they're coming at you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and have a clear shot.
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee is in the groin, and as the attacker writhes in pain, you take the gun out of his hand, you hit him head-on in the face, and you start to retreat, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man is approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, apply force to the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and start to retreat, still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a robbery, unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster, is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into his guidebook
A British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-born travel writer and presenter Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train and a Russian public telephone with his tongue to show off his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment that inspired the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength produced some interesting results.
The idea of licking a train's flush button that thousands of other people have used may seem absolutely repulsive, but the fact is that there are far more harmful bacteria in a kitchen sink, for example.
Ian Wright, throughout his travels in Europe, spoke to doctors and other health professionals about boosting the gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of the food he licked left anything worse than a taste of rancidity in his mouth.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system from the public railroad rails to the sink.
In a film he made about it, he says: "I didn't take much care of my health since I was a child, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worms to muddy water".
He certainly proved his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed a value of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should weigh less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after what his luminometer showed over 4,000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the bacteria counts in various places, such as the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom".
Nothing is dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting in here.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
Mr Wright was provided with Valio Gefilus, a drug containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be followed with interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a bunch of crazy ideas that ended up being, "Let's call Ian".
It is said that concern for gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context -- good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy digestion is a worldwide phenomenon and we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way through this document.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I asked him to - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film".
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while licking others was pretty hard.
I'm glad we got some of that dirty stuff licked on film.
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 showing that 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with gut health and 58% of respondents reported at least occasionally consuming products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of social workers before their eviction destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall.
A family of the needy has left £50,000 worth of damage on their townhouse after being accused of terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction, housing authority officials were shocked to find the property in a dilapidated state.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was trash all over the floor and the walls were dirty.
The family has already moved and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned the house would be saved.
She said, "It's been a nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances must be considered, as this property is likely to be recognised as a fine part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple have three sons who have been staying at the home on and off, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fights using baseball bats, intimidating neighbors, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, fighting, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was listed on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Stinking debris was found in several rooms in the house, which may be demolished.
In a house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn off
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and people regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of their home this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors welcomed the eviction by saying that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone.
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
We've seen the police here more times than we can count.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was incredibly quiet in here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighborhood supervision manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called police
Waste and old toys were lying in the overgrown area of the community hall
He adds: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to take responsibility for her own behaviour and that of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have frightened her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the local community have done to bravely inform us.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time send a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three of the tenant's sons who lived in the house at different times were in their 20s.
A contaminated mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the move
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that have been left around the house
In 2014, she raided a shelf in her house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon got a ticket after she was found guilty of possession of a class B drug she was trying to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private residence in Plymouth after being evicted.
The walls in many rooms of the house were graffiti painted.
Police say they'll be looking to evict tenants who violate their lease.
Angela Crow of Denove and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can get away with it, and to those who would like to follow that behavior", she said.
Denove and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after military jet low-flying over beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were terrified to death
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion was flying incredibly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted there was no security threat.
When a low-flying jet flew over a crowded beach, panic gripped the panicked tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane coming within close range of sun-drenched people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro, in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to lift after being disturbed by the noise of the jet engines, not seeing what was emerging from the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationalists who posted video footage of the dramatic flight on social media, said: "The plane flew really low twice and at one point it seemed to crash".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane appeared from the darkness, flying low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to take a low dive because it was the only way to check the vessel.
The plane was reportedly flying slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the air force insists that there was no threat to people's safety.
Forest fires ravaged parts of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing the area.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half the funeral homes don't follow the rules.
Half of the funeral service providers don't follow the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČTK) found this during its second-quarter inspections.
According to the report, funeral services often fail to inform the deceased of their prices or to issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The COI imposed 41 fines for this, totaling 73,000 crowns.
This was announced today by her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich.
The inspectors found irregularities in 47 of 95 inspections.
In addition to price non-information and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an unofficially verified meter.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products worth a total of 7077 CZK.
This concerned urn packaging, candle covers and vases which were not properly labelled with the mandatory information.
'As there are still infringements in this specific service area, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,' Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It has been reported that Qadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakka, the group's stronghold in the country.
The 17-year-old sultan, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You want to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to a war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision", Akunjee said.
Sultan and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border in February 2015.
Sultana's family found out that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months, she was widowed.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he'll keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the president-elect.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland with a certain degree of credibility.
Reid's spokeswoman later said he hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to rock the boat by electing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "servants and minions" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for both women and men.
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of uncovering celebrities, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by photographs of the female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their photos online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is a favorite of lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to flood the comments section with your peep-a-boo comments under the pseudonym Not Everybody's a Lonely Man in the Middle Ages, we would like to point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of turntables is not associated with a millennial boom that wants to love the originality of physical possession, but with a nostalgia for middle age.
The most likely people to have recently bought a vinyl album are those between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not even about an enthusiastic fan base - it's all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy records are more likely to want to preserve their feelings (56% versus 53%) and like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television news story, the camera would see me walking down a busy Soho street, wearing a decent gray suit, gesturing widely, and then I would stop, reach out my hands, and say something authoritative like, "Let's see this".
Let's see.
While the charm and charm of the heart of Soho is slowly fading - buildings once occupied by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, restaurants, and dining rooms, garment and office supplies - a few fantastic specialty record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, and I'd stand up next to the different men in these stores and try to observe their age and their emotional moods.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray to Reckless Records, has an afternoon meeting in London and is browsing the shops to fill a few hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All of these tapes line the walls of his living room - the picture above (he emailed me a picture, I didn't follow him home).
He has this huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold when he was young and didn't even have a dime.
"A lot of the stuff I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, and it's stuff that would have been issued when I was 11 or 12 years old, and I was too young to buy it", he says.
He agrees that the people who buy the records are more likely to be introverts who like to be alone.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks a lot of the customers she meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records back.
According to my interviews, the most people disposed of their collections was between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back, he says.
That might explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of phonograph records?
It doesn't take you more than a few seconds to find that in a store like Phonica, you find a pleasant community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Weese, some older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
Some record fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record covers, things that evoke memories of a peaceful adolescence.
"I think that filling a void or owning something material can bring some comfort", says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill a space in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" says a colleague from a bunch of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a phonograph that they never use, while 7% of those who buy phonograph records do not have a phonograph.
At this point in the story, he probably looked really worried going through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The trophy aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came up to me recently and said, 'I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a record player".
It's the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers, who get in.
Fopp, where almost an entire floor is now devoted to phonograph records, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn't as laid back as in the stores before - the speakers are now filled with the latest Wild Beasts pop, full of synthesizers and sex, it's good to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly isolated, but the intrusive psychological trauma is hard to predict when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, walks around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various discounted phonograph records.
She's one of those people who checks the billboards rather than spending.
She says she doesn't make much money, so it's not possible for her to collect records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their magic...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My final stop is the store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are just lining up around Polaroid cameras, and then a father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, the walls of which are covered with recordings by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average record collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are too high up on the wall to reach.
It's a pure vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It's no surprise that the demographic area that is more likely to spend more time and money than other areas is also the one that spends the most on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl is definitely.
But while my findings seem to be accurate in YouGov's results - at least in record stores - they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in schools or offices.
Surely he doesn't spend Thursday mornings wandering around the record shops on Berwick Street, going through records and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest average life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, a shark researcher, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
A court in France refused to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to close a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants or basic foods for a few euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a fire hazard and health risk.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide supplemental food for the camp's growing numbers of refugees.
Contested makeshift shops and restaurants often provide free shelter and food to those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift shops, but said that the objections of the prefect of Calais were 'completely understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people living in extremely desperate conditions.
He said the facilities provide quiet meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp's café, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum counseling for hundreds of at-risk unaccompanied minors in the camp.
The petition to protect the Children's Cafe has been signed by over 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight.
The charities Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 after a sharp rise in arrivals over the summer - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
The street is uplifting itself and the volleyball mouth.
"I've been able to train normally since March", he reported at the start of summer training in full force.
What's the matter with you?
I had a pulmonary embolism, then a heart attack.
Because when I was in college in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the long flight to Asia caused trouble?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
I was hurt, no one could find anything.
Then the clot came up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when you're working or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Woodstock, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something else entirely, I was completely cut off for another five days.
I really thought I was dead in the woods, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I just had to live through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood issues, I know I have to be more careful when I fly.
But you can do anything with it.
Except when I tried to get back to prep last year, I had a heart condition.
It's all right now.
Since March, I've been doing some fitness training at home alone to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm physically better than before.
What do you expect from the Mouth?
I'm looking forward to it. The gang's looking good. I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who will be coming.
I hope we sit down humanly so we can get along.
Can you lift the mouth?
It had a reputation for being a beat-up, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now he's finished second.
There's a new team in the mouth, only a few players left.
It was the latest in extraculture, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's the winner after the first round, but not us.
Is coach Brom the key to success?
He's got a lot of experience, he's got a lot of experience, he'll think of something better than last place.
But my coming had nothing to do with him, I made arrangements earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, one of whom I'm good friends with, and it was agreed that he would be here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
Mr. Brom finally came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been coaching for decades, he's a good former player.
It'll move us up.
What can you get?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get a chance on a not-so-high-end team.
I was in the suburbs for two years, but the mouth is more of a challenge than being on the sixth team right away, because you start at the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, the Australian Boehm is already training in Ust.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in the band in college.
And we've been there a few times, and we've sat together after games, so we've gotten to know each other as friends.
We beat them 3-1, I poured it right into him at the start of summer training in Ust.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting an American, he seems like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm the recorder, the one who creates, so I should be able to communicate with everyone.
I immediately went to find out who the players were, I looked up how they played on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We've been on Facebook, texting, he seemed like a joker, he's a good fit.
How are you looking forward to the number one spot on the record?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only 24 and I don't have the temperament to take a shift.
I'd rather be in the middle of the action, I'd rather lead the team than have someone else lead it.
I probably wouldn't play if I had to be a second-recorder and do it full time.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in the Pribrami, when Kust didn't do well as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I took a A and a B.
It was a great year in Old Town, and I had a lot of offers after that, so I chose the story.
The Budyevics wanted me there, so I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a fresh start.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"To be back on the podium and hear the anthem is as sweet as ever", Phelps laughed, his eyes again filled with tears.
His fiancée and mother cheered in the audience again, and Boomer slept soundly with headphones on.
I'm having a hell of a career week.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started competitive swimming and in a few hours it will be over, he said excitedly.
In the final, behind Phelps by almost two seconds, silver medalist Kosuke Hagino of Japan won the long jump.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline at last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps was held in the lead by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home-court Thiago Perreira.
While the defending gold medalists in the final crawl 50 set off for a crushing finish, they fell outside the medal standings.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique collection of medals in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement, he advanced to the finals of the 100-meter butterfly.
The legend was not overshadowed by fellow countryman Ryan Murphy, who won a landmark double - he won the 100 and the double in Rio.
He finished 37 seconds behind Australian Mitchell Larkin in the final, while Russian Yevgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth in the 200m at last year's World Championships, he's become the king of the marathon in Rio.
He has deposed Larkin, who had the same double at last year's World Championships.
But he's just won a medal at the Olympics.
In the 100m breaststroke, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was her fourth medal at the Games, and for Manuel, her second after a silver in the relay.
She won Olympic gold in swimming, the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who come after me, for whom sport will become a love and will reach where I am", Manuel said, moved.
Third was Sarah Sjöström of Sweden, who won the 100-meter butterfly in Rio in a world record and has a silver in the 200-meter butterfly.
And then came sixth, to world record holder Cate Campbell of Australia.
The 200 breaststroke was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, her first Olympic medal in 27 years.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships, her best finish was fourth in the event in 2013.
Russia's Yulia Yefimova won second silver in Rio, battling the hostility of both spectators and rivals to enter the Games despite a doping record.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
"I'm so tired of this", said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was won by a special panel of CAS sports referees just before the games.
They took my appeal and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or has a different opinion, let them go to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
What about the midnight launch?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a strange day.
They didn't know who he was up against until less than an hour before the game.
They must have mastered tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, in unusual time, the match began on the small court number one.
The first hundred didn't start well, then they got the lead, but they didn't make it to the finish line at 19:19.
In the second, they were clearly better and tied, but the decisive tie-break fell through.
Most importantly, a series of broken serves meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians", lamented Hermann.
How would you rate the game?
After a bad start, before I could play, we got into the game beautifully.
I ended up losing the revenue I was used to on the last balloon.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we came at them with a view of the field, a different defense, and we pushed on the serve.
There was a bad pitch in the tie-break, and we took this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
Too bad we missed the first set.
We were able to pull it off, but we were missing the spots.
The second set was great, and the third set was a serve.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that five was, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How was your little playground number one?
Similar to China in the side yards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock in the morning, it was quiet, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from downtown.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't.
How was the preparation for the game when you learned the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
She was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon has prepared his tactics for almost every option that was available.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so after this page, we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a fight at midnight?
I guess not.
We used to play at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
Block Birlov's Russian in the preliminary round of the play-off at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann hugging in the preliminary round of the play-offs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Slukova: Because we've played the last two games in the group of ten, we had a shifted regime before.
That was two hours too long.
It's weird, I can't imagine any other sport having athletes who have to perform their best at 12 o'clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not exactly typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Since the group was our goal, it's okay, on the one hand, good.
We did what we said we would.
But now I'm sad after the game.
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow onwards, I'll remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You can't escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all non-Thai passport holders who decide to purchase a SIM card from a local operator while in Thailand.
Not only tourists, but also people with long-term visas who work or marry in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that there will be no exemptions.
The plan to sell SIM cards exclusively to foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
New measures to allow their location to be tracked are planned to be implemented within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which allows to solve crimes committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help detect persons who exceed the authorised length of stay.
The retailers should have a special SIM for foreigners in addition to the Thai-only SIM within six months.
The only difference is the tracking feature, which will be permanently turned on on Thai passportless cards.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
"This feature is not available for Thai SIMs because they are always easy to follow", Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one operator gave out free start-up SIM cards to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering the same measure as Thailand.
They also currently require SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not mean that foreigners are obliged to obtain a local SIM card when entering the country.
They can of course use roaming services with their own SIM card, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country, once they have crossed the border, i.e. have logged in a SIM card to their network, only know the relevant network information.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming rates compared to local operators is so vast that even most tourists will start looking for local SIM cards during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have been met with immediate criticism from foreigners living legally in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation down and compares the proposed system to a requirement to provide a residence address on immigration documents in terms of privacy.
In addition, the police will need a warrant if they need to track a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will be met with a more indefinite punishment.
"If a service provider tracks the location of a SIM without a warrant, it will be charged with a crime", Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While currently a specific number will only be recycled after the 90 days period after which the SIM has not logged in, once again, the number could be recycled after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building on Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a spa on the terrace.
Why did you choose the apartment in the new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where the trustee would take care of most of the property.
The condition was that there was enough parking and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older structure.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swings, high energy consumption and so on.
Large terraces were also a prerequisite, something the old building was unable to offer.
For more interesting visits, see Modern Apartment magazine.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamilla Polákova from Artiga Studio.
Why did you go to them?
Would you recommend working with a professional to anyone?
We would recommend working with an architect to anyone who designs a home from scratch, because it's a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of materials available and are able to tailor the interior according to the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, based on a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, we were also in a position to renovate our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a spacious social living space with a suitable design for a family of four, a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to achieve a connection between the apartment and the terraces and to implement intelligent home control.
And of course, the quality of the performance had to be taken into account.
Did you leave it to the experts or did you intervene in the final design of the interior?
All the designs, including technical drawings and material samples, were approved, but the design always came from the architects.
We started by defining what we wanted to do with the design and showing some of the interior elements that we wanted to incorporate into the design, like carpeting or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karl Malich, Karl Dryusil, Wáclav Spály or architect Otto Gutfreund, helped us to orient ourselves in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea, as were the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then worked together to see if they all fit together, and then we used visualizations to verify.
Did you have any complications in your implementation that made you give up on your original ideas or start new ones?
Maybe it was just in the early stages of the project, when we came to the site, the moment we were able to climb up to our floor height for the first time, and we found that the views we had planned were actually overshadowing the surrounding buildings.
We changed the whole arrangement overnight.
Granite was used for the kitchen line and the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by leather-covered wooden surfaces, such as the upholstery of Norma by Arper's dining and bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there anything you wish you had done differently today?
I think it's a modern aerial interior that, above all, serves its purpose.
We're not making any changes, most of the post-movement adjustments have been in the shading and terrace housing levels.
Perhaps the only criticism is the floor, where the walnut wood seems too sensitive for a dog house.
The architects, Lenka Langer and Kamila Hornych, the author of the project.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications within the building.
The placement of lighting fixtures in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet is an important element for the interior.
It brought daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is one of the building modifications that has been very beneficial to the function of the entire apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where else did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved around a lot.
I've lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led to a job at a magazine.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are generally negative, but recently it's gotten worse.
It's interesting that you're bringing up negativity.
That's how some people judge Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not think so when they come to France because they are not as perceptive as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big topic is money.
People feel they have little money, whereas the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's attitude towards Muslims.
I can't understand that.
For example, on the street where I lived, a non-Muslim neighbor started to look down on me just because I was a Muslim.
Like I was some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed.
So you've decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and I came across an Air France job opening here in Prague.
I admit, I didn't know Prague at all at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of the whole atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I could do anything, dress any way I wanted, and no one would judge me.
In France, you're always looked at uncomfortably, like when you're dressed in strange clothes and stuff.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the Prague people care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I started a website where people list and search for shared housing.
We're only in Prague, but we'd like to expand to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czech, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say, another thing about Czechs is that they're more distant at first.
He doesn't let anyone in his body.
That's quite a change from where I grew up.
In the South, everyone hugs and kisses each other's faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it pretty easy in Prague, because I think everyone here speaks English.
Even at parties or in the grocery store.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And with everyone being able to communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't have that much of a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, someone comes along to help me.
Have you had any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
I can think of one experience.
My supervisor, Czech, once told me about a French football team and said something along the lines of: They're not French, they're Africans.
That was kind of touching.
But that anyone has a problem with me being a Muslim, that's never happened to me.
Even though a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels might happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, these days, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Islam, moreover, does not condone violence at all.
To me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists using your faith to protect themselves?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to watch the violence news too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at the square of George of Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims demonstrated alongside Christians against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But my understanding is that these people feel the need to prove that they don't approve of violence.
I don't think they need to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little bit more religious than I am, so we have some pretty wild discussions about Islam sometimes, because we all have a little bit of a different view of Islam.
I'm from France, so I had a different education, they were taught Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the inferiority of women.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel inferior in any way.
It's the other way around.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It's also related to the fact that you're not wearing a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And it's mostly down to the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a very principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to you how you interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about these things.
So when I read the Koran, where God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, I'm not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia where scarves are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
I have for now.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm having a great time in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own kids here.
I think Prague is the perfect city for that.
Czech Muslims joined Christians in protesting the violence.
The yacht, the Gozel Fencla, was hit by a wind in Rio.
The Czech yachtsman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová sailed on Friday in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two races.
That would guarantee the Czech a place in the final race.
You collect packages like pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for transporting shipments is the work of TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With this idea, they brought to life three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national app Carriage in May.
There are a thousand cities on it right now, and we're expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Carriage app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how much package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone else might be asking for a ride that day.
When the route and time of delivery match, they're paired and both receive a mutual notification.
At that point, the chat will open, and the couple will arrange for a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to get a package to its courier?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't estimate how many registrations and how many trips it takes to get the coverage to be perfectly optimal and every supply matched with demand.
It's already working on the main roads, and it's logically easier than going between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are building trust and finding out that no one's getting away with anything.
You've never had to solve a case like this before?
How many users has the service two months after launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people building roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Is there any chance the sender will be waiting too long?
We hope to compete with the big conglomerates just because we can deliver the same day at a fraction of the price.
A big company will pay you several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the path someone's already on.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, feeding into huge multinational carriers, as well as chain stores, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality didn't match what they paid for.
No one wants to find a note in their mailbox saying they have to pick up a package at the branch, not later than 7:00 p.m.
I had been waiting for six hours for the package and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster, more functional service that won't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
The two men were Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in IT.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started to develop an application by Shippansee LTD, which uses already scheduled routes between world capitals, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The app, called Transit, was started in December last year and released in May of this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The app was developed by Mesíkek and Mesíkek Profi in January this year and was made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The idea from the beginning was to make all these applications that one day would merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy is a hot topic lately, and this is a service like Airbnb or Uber.
Aren't you worried about operating in an area where no one can say much about, where the sharing boundary is and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if it succeeds and we go up, we'll be another thorn in the grey economy.
But even though some people save and some people make money, it's not the intention to bypass the financial authorities and tax authorities.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to pay taxes on their income if they make a profit from it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The shipper saves money and the carrier earns or reduces the cost of the journey.
That's the powerful idea that connects the interests of both sides.
In an age of social media that divides people, we'd like this one to bring them closer together.
There can be good stories, people are happy to help someone and they will tell each other about it.
Maybe someone's bringing you some forgotten glasses or keys or pills.
I think people have been missing a personal touch for a long time, and we call this app a service for people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't go missing?
Each user of the application scans their ID card and enters a bank account, debit or credit card number when registering.
These are the channels that give the service and the person credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the reviews of the senders.
We'll offer insurance, we're still working out the details.
The courier is liable for the loss or damage of an uninsured consignment, but under criminal law he is not liable for the contents if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a sealed package in his trunk, the criminal liability falls on the sender.
Is there any risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
The data are traceable to the administrative authority, which is the only one who can see them, even we cannot see them, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money does the courier get after the successful delivery of the package?
The courier sets the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for the contact facilitation.
That money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push volume.
Nor can a courier be accused of not delivering a package when he actually delivered it, and both pick-up and delivery are verified by QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or the contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cub, medium as a flat egg, and large as a beer bottle.
After that, there are no more restrictions, and if someone has room in the car, they can carry a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the package app, so the courier can see what they want.
You don't even have to wrap it up unless you want to unpack it to hide the contents.
You put the forgotten sweater in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend of mine had this idea over two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo of an application with a transnational reach that targets mainly air passengers.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't looking for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we set up Shippansee Ltd. in London to give the whole product more credibility.
But this is not the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we've focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we're trying to get the app out there, because the whole thing has been a little bit of a birthing process, and there's still a lot to work on and improve.
We're trying to respond to customer feedback and the foreign market is not as much of a concern right now.
We know it's a long-distance run, but we're not holding back, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were somehow an upgrade.
The carriage was born when we thought that the domestic segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third app by Mexico is local, for the city.
But he can deliver a package to the exact address halfway around the world.
It works for shippers just like the delivery service, but the difference is that as a courier, you see the shipments as the points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your phone.
We've created an app for couriers who want to make a living off of it, and we call it Mexico Profi.
So someone can make a nice extra buck picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app downloaded in Prague, a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn a ride to work.
Now that everyone's messing with the pokemon, they can collect this just the same.
You see where the orders are in the city, you go to it, you click on it, you see when it needs to be delivered, and you move the shipment.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
We're still working on a web interface right now that's going to be the hub for companies to send shipments, and it's going to fill in the data on the web, and it's going to create points on the map.
We can then invoice them for their use of the service, for example, every month.
You're working on the project full-time now?
It's exhausting, but we have it in our workplace so we can keep the project alive and growing.
We're not a powerful multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped in with other ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to manage to dominate with us not the Czech market, but who should, with a pardon of the ball, go with us into a global product and become the next huge player in the market like Airbnb and Uber.
The story arc of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring a variety almost forgotten.
That will fix the second part, and the solo gameplay will be more colorful than in Call of Duty, according to initial reports.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling will be based on the very concept of the grid connection in the first part.
The freedom of movement, which includes running, is also enjoyed by the fighting titan.
In addition to the action sequences, the game will also feature levels focused on agile movement.
They'll look like a platform and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and rope skating are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes, in addition, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will be maps that resemble labyrinths and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and lower platforms and close massive doors.
You'll be adjusting the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore oscillate between the fierce action and the quieter moments of exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper, a foot soldier with a dream of becoming a pilot.
Cooper and Captain Lastimos are shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness will not be kind to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal injuries in the crash, and Cooper will be tasked with operating the captain's Titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls to the titan will be significant.
Players will be able to learn about the soldier's past, but the robot's personalized communication will also create humorous moments.
Like when the titan dryer lists all the injuries that Cooper could sustain in a planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
The result will be available in two months, and Bonusweb will give you your first impressions of the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is out on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes alive, but the original publisher remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After THQ went bankrupt in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the rights to use the company's logo and name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being developed for the publisher, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a man 20 years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she tried for him for a long time, obviously, then they got together.
He's a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she dated a guy like that before me.
She's totally crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girlish, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He regularly left work at 2:30, so she always left at 3 for shopping.
Every day she tried to see him.
I found out later that they met at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I never got to go in there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was mind controlled.
I think she soon found out that I was manipulative, that I would do whatever she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just being a little bit of a pussy.
But at the time, my neighbors suggested that they knew, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all went south, it would be bad.
Only my daughter knew that this would happen to everyone in the family.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment and said I needed help with something in the laundry.
He went with me, and I told him I got an anonymous tip, that he was seeing my wife, and that it all pointed to that.
I asked him what he thought.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, looking at the ground and not saying a word.
Then, about that time, I met his wife on my way home from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe me at all.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't say anything to me.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of guy who's never been out much, who has trouble meeting anyone, let alone finding a woman.
So I never even thought about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and move on.
But it wasn't.
And I never really got over it.
I still have it in me.
I used to let her know that a lot, but I finally stopped for the sake of it.
He's still living next door and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's a workaholic.
I think she always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's a good one.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks about how happy we are in our marriage.
But she told me once that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see she still loves him, he's her god.
And I'm tired of living like this.
Even when it started and I was having a really bad time, I once told her I didn't want to live and I asked her what she would say if I quit.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room".
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government and local Muslim minority are appealing for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion", Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He wants to ensure that only the clergy educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where money often comes from preachers vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was established in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already intended to contribute to transparency in the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon she was stricken with internal contradictions, and she never functioned properly.
"It is a total failure", Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former interior and defense minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known for his support of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and dozens more are being considered.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The imams were reportedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where worshippers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the now-defunct foundation.
All of which hastened further terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks − to provide funding for mosques from domestic resources and also to oversee imams.
It is not yet clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are under consideration.
One of these is a special levy on halal food, especially meat from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by halal food sellers for the granting of a permit.
Some of the money would go directly into the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims travelling to Mecca.
Each year, some 30,000 leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, French mosques should be staffed only by ministers who have completed educational programs at French universities.
This would make their preaching compatible with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 since December and more will follow", said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men", he said.
I'm from Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman Friday morning in a shopping mall in Zaragoza, northern Spain, reports the Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
A man was waiting in his car outside the mall when he started shooting.
Witnesses said the man then turned the gun on himself, reports the Independent.
The woman was taken to hospital by her daughter, who was uninjured, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11:00 in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing Spain's Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was likely an unresolved recent divorce between the two partners.
The curls with the rhubarb, wakame with the algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes for light, digestible food, but we Czechs are rebels and have our own tastes and our own heads.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled ham, buckwheat, pork rind.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except for the occasional salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing saves time and dishes, and it is a social activity, and no one needs to be confined to the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making yourself a good meal that make the meal special, a little ritual, but without the need for long cooking, baking, frying, or strangulation.
And they'll also help us stay healthy.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-crafted griffins are all that's needed to make the preparation fun and the food itself a truly exotic delicacy.
As are the even easier rice paper rolls from today's recipe.
This even eliminates the time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can be soaked in water for a moment, and then it's up to the cook's imagination how he's going to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that the ingredients are generally readily available.
Including the pickled sweet-sour ginger, which is a staple of sushi and fresh rolls.
You can make it at home, but real pink ginger garlic has a unique pungent pungent flavor that is delicious thanks to a secret recipe that mixes several types of vinegar and ginger.
So all you have to do is buy a bag of the right size, and the supplement with its proven antibacterial, digestive, and cough- and flu-resistance properties is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used in particular in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes in various festive occasions and rituals.
Long, ribbed leaves are also popular in many Asian and South American countries as an "aid" to prepare a variety of baked, cooked, and fried foods, which are wrapped in them like cardboard.
The banana leaf also gives the dish a specific flavor.
In our country, they are available in exotic fruit and vegetable stores, even precut into a circle.
But choose only leaves that are rich green, meaning healthy - uncracked and unstained.
A salad made from wakame seaweed, sesame, and sesame oil is similarly easy to prepare.
You can buy it frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi are likely to be familiar with nori algae.
In Japan, it is one of the most important seaweed species, and it is produced by cutting, pressing, and drying nori leaves - sheets specifically for sushi.
Wakame - a dark green algae that grows in the waters around Hokkaido - is eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame? It's said that Asian women used it for their recovery after childbirth.
And in fact, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair, and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and ground wakame is also used as a condiment, for example to flavor rice.
First, the fresh algae is let soak in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water, and boiled for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, the middle ribs are cut off, and they are further prepared, perhaps as a favorite salad.
But buying it ready-made, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all you have to do is wrap a roll with a simple vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
It's like a bombshell of longevity.
As long as you hold on and don't throw in an extra grilled buck.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
The Asians know how to do it.
A few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines flavor.
And that's one two.
Four slices of rice paper, 40 grams of carrots, 40 grams of white radish, 100 grams of green maple, 60 grams of pickles, 60 grams of wakame seaweed and 60 grams of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped cilantro, a tablespoon of black sesame, a tablespoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 grams of mango and 40 grams of pickled ginger gari, a little pine nuts.
First, we'll get the curls ready.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, we briefly boil the cartilage shoots in hot water, and after about three minutes, we let them cool quickly in ice water to keep them colored.
We put a vegetable filling on the permitted paper and wrap it.
We prepare the filling with radish, carrots, and pickles, cut them into thin slices, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add sliced coriander, mix thoroughly, and place on rice paper.
We place the cranberry shoots on the banana leaf, add the curls, and finally, we decorate the entire dish with wakame algae, ginger filling, a slice of mango, sprinkle black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in rugby sevens, Fiji's pick takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in rugby sevens ended in a devastating defeat at the last hurdle, Fiji defeating Great Britain 43-7 in the final on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The Fijians put on a master class in tackling, tackling, tackling, supporting play, line running and brute strength - and won gold, their first ever Olympic medal.
The defeat came with an unexpected consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7-5 win over South Africa in the semi-finals on the same day may have frozen them in the final.
But Fiji in their form would beat a 15-man team in perfect health.
It's probably no consolation for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: the Fiji team's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England manager at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost one here.
This defeat may hurt, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started off spectacularly, the British's penetration reflected in their joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like running behind a line of moving buses, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The clock was running four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, which was the conversion.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but he only slowed the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalu threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the return and the clock was still more than a minute... from the first half.
Vatema Ravouva then broke through the British's weakness and slammed into the line where he scored.
After conversion to 29:0 the break followed.
It was like Fiji was born for rugby sevens while the British were still learning passing.
That's kind of what it is.
The British made a massive change in the second half and stopped the Fijian advance for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after a brilliant Fijian half-time Josua Tuisova pushed through.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, throwing a touchdown in the left corner at a 36-7 increase, but the game was long ago won by the Pacific Islanders and their fans sang, waved flags and danced on the grass.
It was hard not to admire the Fijian's utterly exhilarated attitude.
In the final moments, Mata William added another attempt to sweeten the Fijians' victory.
The whistle blew, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell on the grass, all over the place.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, and Great Britain narrowly beat South Africa by one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, with his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half.
A brilliant late drop by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England U15 team, secured the victory - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win the rowing race by a trainer's battle with cancer.
You won't find more emotional gold in these Games, that's for sure.
From first shot to last shot, over 220 punishing breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two rowers on the boat, there were three voices, and as the boat swam to its second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, they were joined on board by the still-present coach Robin Williams, the first women in British sport to achieve this feat.
Their lead was absolute, their 39th race overall, and they were undefeated.
What we see - two outstanding athletes flying on the water with swank elegance - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of helping hands that are making a difference little by little, and no hand has been more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he was going to live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
He said it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and I had this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your perspective a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately for the trio, he was able to start treatment early in 2014, off-season, and keep the blackout to a minimum - if that's what you'd call it under the circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get my act together fast.
That was a spur.
I was in the hospital, walking around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the win, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual, trying to manage his own restlessness.
Stanning, a captain in a regiment of the Royal Artillery who has been to Afghanistan, said: "I've been under a lot of stress this week, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much".
It just goes to show me again how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together, and Robin has, too.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, as crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused as much as we could be at the moment.
Helen was yelling, "Keep going, keep going.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and we didn't aspire to achieve anything great.
We weren't looking forward to the fireworks tonight, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The twins take a year to decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better about it, she said.

What, prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says taxi-hacker Rubeš to the landmark indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are accused, Czech Press reported.
You've done a series of reports exposing fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
You've faced some nasty fights with exposed actors because of it.
How groundbreaking is the report about the indictment of the members of the organized group to you?
I thought there might be some kind of trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's not worth it.
The first thing they should do is return all the money they stole.
And they should return them by giving everyone a free ride.
That's a rather odd solution.
Does this mean that you don't think the punishment is effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared they don't do the job anymore.
Like one guy makes ping-pong, one guy delivers pizza, and one guy just completely gives up.
The defendants could theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I have a problem with deprivation of liberty in general.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
People like that should give back to the company that took her.
For a quarter of a century they have done this, ruined our country's reputation and robbed the people of their wealth.
Now they can make a good business card and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would be a public service.
Like someone who goes to pick up trash, they get a car and they drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at the Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
He's one of the people who started viral videos and direct-to-web videos in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now prepares the program Prague Guide, which is aimed primarily at foreign viewers.
In short reports, Rubeš advises them on which services in Prague they should avoid and which they should use.
He has previously directed series such as How Do You Do It, City of Frauds, Life in Luxury, Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
The police had been tracking her for months.
Can a network of taxidermists be called a mafia?
They're cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
It's more like a gang of juniors, but they're definitely organized.
Just that they're guarding each other's stables.
Prague is all plots.
I've found that, for example, the main train station doesn't like the Paris station, and the Paris station doesn't like the taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Baths.
Everyone just keeps their own place and each group is organized in some way.
It's obviously a tangled web.
But the total number of defendants is seven, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned drivers about the traffic controls.
As you say, the unwanted phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague taxi scammers do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still out there.
I'm talking about Aleš Smiley, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and he drives people.
Last time I drove with him, he asked me for 700 for two miles.
The police didn't arrest him for some reason.
They only picked a few people out of the whole big group.
The same situation is, of course, in other locations in Prague.
So it's hard to eradicate an already infamous Prague scandal with the indictment of seven people, which is apparently much bigger.
It's not entirely useless, of course.
It helps, but it doesn't wash away all the evil, that's the truth.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, like the Charles Bridge or the Paris Avenue?
Yes, that's right.
They're in these locations every day, and they're breaking regulations every day.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrates.
It's not even a pussy anymore, it's a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet, some of them, even though they are only part of the group, are brought to justice.
This is a breakthrough.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I take it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even though I feel like I need to do a little better, I'm still going to keep doing it.
You need to push on the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that's not the case. There are more of them, of course.
You still trying to confront them in cabs?
I do test drives sometimes, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged $1.50 for a two-mile [3.5 km] ride, although he later claimed that it was $1.50 (he used a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cabbie was so cute and rude, he went to the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver pasted a decimal point on the meter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can you say that the insolence of the taxidermists has not abated even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged senseless amounts for short trips?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did it go with the cab driver who demanded 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away saying they couldn't discuss it with him on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that courtroom, too.
There's gonna be a cabbie with his receipts on one side, and the police on the other.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate cannot use the secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the scams, the taxi drivers themselves pointed out the precedent.
I've been shooting but I always wanted to use it for the news.
Are you afraid that this fact might protect them from a court case?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver would be able to drive for six or ten crowns a mile because he wouldn't make a living at it.
You were talking about a decimal point trick that is done by underground cab drivers, especially for foreign clients.
Is it still relevant, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after your stories are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by airing the show in reverse.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, and he was bragging to me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard sticker on the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is".
If fines have not worked well for tax fraudsters, can a lawsuit against their colleagues be a warning?
Is there anything that can deter them from cheating?
You talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything that can stop them.
But someone from those places can push them out.
And these are honest cab drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there for real.
In my experience, the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately predominant.
But are they willing to go after those who tarnish their services?
They have a taste, but they lack a mind.
They can't walk around in it and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of a proposal for a nationwide ban coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it was not clear what they really wanted.
They said they didn't want to protest Uber, they just wanted the same conditions as the service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It just happened to block Prague and it just became the best possible Uber ad.
Overall, how do you assess the approach of the Prague city council in dealing with the problem of overpricing?
You can see that the Crime Lab had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole there that was leaking information, which means the taxi department did its job for years in vain.
I hope that clerk gets a last-ditch check on all the failed checks so he realizes what he did.
Because that's the worst part of it.
I even went on a test drive with him, which I found out later from their schedule.
It's been months since the last installments of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, mostly foreign audiences, which is what the show's really focused on.
Whenever I have friends overseas, I play them the videos.
And then when we walk down the Old Town Square, they're surprised to see that the same people that you see in the footage are actually standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
I mean, really.
I'd put a fence around them so people would look at them.
The Communist Museum right down the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need one?
- I know.
I'm on a service that doesn't charge cash, but a credit card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no possibility of fraud.
But there are plenty of dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street since.
When I got in the car, the driver said, "Well, you've got guts".
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
Tax fraud was reported as far back as 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém went for a check-in dressed as an Italian tourist and was cheated by a driver by 200 on the first try.
Editor Rubesh has had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him $820 for a trip from Staroměstský to Wenceslas Square, which is about $195 per kilometer, according to the report's authors.
The Prague Magistrates' Court has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre.
The report also includes other surprising amounts: for example, a two-kilometer trip from the rue Parisijska to the rue Truhlářská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
The cost of a one-mile [2.5 km] ride to Angel is as much as six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as little chemicals as possible, and the longer the better.
The dirt comes off well, although sometimes the dirt has to be taken down with a scalpel, pulled out of the creases.
It is not easy and it is not quick, said the restorer Vanessa Trostova from Oldrichov in The Hague.
Hats off to her: the tomb has a staircase that requires countless climbs and descents.
"A restaurateur should be careful, patient and unpretentious about the work environment", she said.
This is far from her first restoration work in Friedland.
Thanks to her, the stone facade elements in the back of the Frydlant Town Hall were restored, she also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiša, St. John the Baptist in Frydlant, Pieta in the Frydlant Circle Street, the Marian column in Frydlant or the atlantis in the front of the bath in the New Town under the Smrk.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redern in Frydlant began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of impurities and crust, the loose stone pieces are secured against falling and shifting; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
They also have to be treated and preserved.
The inscriptions on the tombstone will be gold again.
"Then the writing on the marble slabs is gilded with pure gold", says Vera Sobot, a spokeswoman for the State Monuments Department in the city of Frydlant.
There is no historical record of the tombstone having undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, the holes in the marble columns are striking.
They're hundreds of years old and they're the remains of a tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion in the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstones, Sobot noted.
At the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the moderately over-priced restorers are at home.
After the flood of 2010, the tombs that were submerged had to be repaired, the baptistery, the murals in the tomb, and now the tomb were restored.
"We would like to do stained glass in the future", Sobot said.
The church is in very good condition, and we put money into maintenance and repair every year.
The restoration work on the Redernov tomb will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
It's going to be paid for by grants, the city's not putting any of its own money into this part of the renovation.
The remaining 28 thousand crowns will be donated by the Ministry of Culture, said Frýdlant Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The winnings for the tombstone restoration were decided by the town council.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked by means of indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one and a half months.
The markets are characterised by low volatility and growth.
Who'd have thought it at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P 500 index, which was undergoing a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has gained 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long run, which have always done their bit in the end.
As US equities reach historic highs, volatility is now at its lowest level since 2014, when markets grew more contentedly and without fear, thanks to quantitative easing by the US central bank, and the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent, as it is today.
And that you don't.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for gradual rate hikes, quantitative easing is in full swing in Europe and Japan, and last week the Bank of England joined in, buying £70bn of bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is thus pushing already low yields even lower and contributing to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
That's the million-dollar question, of course.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is growing almost constantly with no major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is not really an issue anymore, so we probably shouldn't be too surprised if US equities continue to hold out in a similarly calm regime.
It's a shame Juncker is not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said Juncker when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, having served in so many different transnational political roles that we could hardly have sought a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission's chief negotiator on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.
Juncker's choice has dampened hopes that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock-hard European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As Internal Market Commissioner (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He understood it as only he could: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the capitalist model.
An advocate of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of a banking union and, hostile to anything that comes from London's financial centre, City, he pushed through legislation that over-regulated the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unyielding and probably ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the discretion, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, the Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker has not learned from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of all!
The earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin has released his close associate Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergei Ivanov from his post as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
He was also responsible for the repressive actions of the 'Donetsk People's Republic' and 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
Putin has hinted that Ivanov is being released at his own request.
In a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was in line with Ivanov's wishes, made when he took office, to be chief of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for environment and transport.
The news of the change in the head of the presidential administration, now led by Ivanov's former deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is considered one of Putin's closest aides.
For example, this former KGB officer has served as Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He's also leaving his seat on the President's Security Council.
But Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that he was actually the longest-serving head of the head of state's administration.
He stayed there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already been replaced in this function in the 25 years since it was set up.
Neither the Quit nor the dummies Uncle and Shafar will play the final.
So far, not one of Friday's tennis matches has turned into a final.
Petra Kvitová lost her first fight, to Puerto Rican Monica Puig, 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was soon followed by Czech idiots Safariva and Strycova.
The Williams sisters' slayers were close to winning the first set, but they lost two setbacks and the Russians finally captured a set in the shortened game.
The second set was lost by 4:6.
Half a success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a clear lead, beating the other Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second despite slowing down in the final.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind has calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonek said.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for the promotion.
So it took some strength, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower from Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topink-Knapková, however, did not follow in the footsteps of Snyka.
The 35-year-old rower finished fourth in her heat in today's semi-final and will compete in the B final on Saturday for seventh to 12th place.
The gold of London is not defended like that.
It's the first time I've ever been a finalist in an Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I did a good race and I gave it my all.
The competition was simply better, Topink Knapková bowed to them.
She fought to the end, believing she'd be among the elite six in her fourth game.
She gave up just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were level, that anyone could step up from that field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could get through the Austrian to the finals.
"Unfortunately, today was the race of my life", she told the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to break through the qualifying for the second time, this time with a minor injury in the leg.
In it, the Nefeshal came in 33rd place.
The Russians did the best in qualifying.
Sergei Kamenskyy advanced from the first row with 629 points, Kirill Grigoryan from the second (628.9).
The gunshot wound was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in Rio, including Czech sevens fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Caches are eleventh in the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-second.
The British woman leads the way, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to 198 centimeters, as did second-seeded Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both of them have the best high-level performance in the history of the seven-man event.
They tried another 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we put aside the absurdity of the questions posed, German society has undergone a profound self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictatorships emerged in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted starvation, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis brutally exterminated about six million Jews, and the total death toll from World War II is estimated at 60 million.
Atrocities were committed by both the Germans and the Soviets in occupied and abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only were a few individuals guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or by sticking its head in the sand.
It's not just a peculiarity of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the war, came the denazification, the Nuremberg Trials.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew older, they asked, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you!
It brought about a real reflection and healing of society.
Until recently, the German elite were primarily concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they are certainly not about reuniting Alsace-Lorraine or attacking someone militarily - in retaliation - as everyone will admit.
After losing the Cold War, there was no great reflection in Russia.
The window of possible positive change finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's policy is revenge, the conquest of lost territory, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of your own people are of no value to the top.
Strike your own, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe it's only through decades of despotic rule that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior -- predestined to Asian tyranny.
Who benefits from the rising tensions over Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from increased tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The Ukrainian side used the pretext of the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than two years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides of the conflict are obviously contradictory and difficult to independently verify, so we can only think about the age-old question of who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks in Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine obviously denies and instead accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
In taking on and acting as a mediator for the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic', he has actively supported the 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
If we go with the Ukrainian version, what would Russia gain from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
Escalating tensions over Crimea can only hurt Russia, especially from the West in the form of further sanctions and an intensified anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the situation in Ukraine has been a distraction in the wake of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credibility with its citizens, with current support for President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
The Ukrainian economy would have gone bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to once again draw strong attention to its country to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its standing with voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the security forces are once again trying to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to even greater Russia.
It is only to be hoped that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives not only of soldiers but of all civilians on both hostile sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero level since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The Commission also noted that the Union industry was not able to recover from the material injury suffered by the Union industry.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of any significant distortions of competition in the Union market.
Compared to the previous month, travel increased in July 2016 for the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), culture and leisure (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2,2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence has been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to light last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it was investigating a hack into the Democratic Party's central office servers.
But there's no official report on Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it would reveal that the US intelligence services were monitoring the hack and could reveal how they were doing it and what resources they were using.
Two Russian intelligence services were reportedly involved in the attack.
The new Cybersecurity Advisory Board is expected to be established in early 2020.
The Russian trace material was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Officials were briefed on only a small group of eight top congressmen, known in the United States as the Gang of Eight.
It's made up of the leaders of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic chairs of both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the House Defense and Security Committee.
Democratic Party chief of staff Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure top-notch security of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the frozen salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
Based on a consumer's suggestion of health problems after eating the food Wild-nosed salmon - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out a check in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the expiry date of 22.11.2016 which the customer had brought to his attention was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiry date of 11.12.2016 was withdrawn.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the fish's body cavity or muscle are a potent allergen, and human-eaten live larvae can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Stycha.
We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience of this branded product.
The above batch was immediately withdrawn from sale and, as a precautionary measure, all other batches of this item were withdrawn.
"There was a misunderstanding on the part of the supplier we were dealing with, and we also had this product tested ourselves", Albert Barbora Vanko, a spokeswoman for the company, told Newsweek.
If the customer has bought this product, he can return it at any of the chain's stores and get his money back.
Larvae will be killed by frost and adequate heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrnjata.
The presence of the dangerous product was reported to the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administrations.
According to the web site insecuritypotravin.cz, people who ingest the parasite may develop anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may go unnoticed, the CTC said.
Symptoms occur one to two weeks after eating under-heated infected fish.
After three weeks of onset of disease, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
The adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both high and low temperatures and are therefore killed either by sufficient heat treatment of the fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have also examined the salmon at the consignee of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three out of five samples tested had the parasite in them.
A consignment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic in early April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS).
Shipped, mostly to the Ahold chain, were 919 packages to date.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being withdrawn from the stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told ČTK on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately prohibited the dispatch of any further products from the warehouse after the positive samples were found.
17-year-old British girl trying to escape from Raqqa, apparently killed by Russian airstrikes.
After the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist who was killed shortly after, came the sober.
The long-awaited paradise of the caliphate had become a hell on earth for British girls from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to relatives.
She called her in Britain repeatedly, telling her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to fire without any intention of retaliation, The Telegraph quotes Tasnim Akunjee, a lawyer for the family of the deceased girl.
The last trace led to Rakka, where the girl was last heard from.
Then came the news of her death, which we can't verify.
The family communicated with her from her East London apartment.
They discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet a former student again.
But Khadiz was likely killed before she could escape, since the house she was staying in was razed to the ground in a raid in May, reports Britain's ITV News.
The TV station added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would put up with the sky blue just to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
The week she was contemplating fleeing ISIS territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and reportedly publicly beaten to death.
I think she (Kadiza) took it as a warning and decided not to take the risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas left on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they were headed to Gatwick Airport and back through Turkey into ISIS-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadizou back.
You'd put up with the sky blue just to get your child out of the danger zone, and this family did everything they could, every ounce of effort to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking their own capture, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that Kadiz's fate can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are being deceived by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how different it is from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return", Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they've also gone silent, their families have to accept that they're most likely dead.
Go to jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county seat and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the mid-18th century, the town hall was used for court hearings, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
Conditions were deplorable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them successfully.
So the city council decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building, completed in 1848, was much more hospitable to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as the smaller repair facility was expensive to operate and not very profitable.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
Opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new to see for themselves how different conditions were.
The guides in period costumes add to the authentic experience.
There is also a torture chamber where visitors can learn about the punishments that criminals received, such as the breaking of fingers and the burning of body marks.
As part of the tour, tourists may be locked in a cell, usually for a photo op or to get a feel for the prison experience.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland's most notorious haunted locations.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone there, and to this day, the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
But a night like this will cost £300, which is about £1,500 in current terms.
In addition to being a popular tourist attraction, the village also has great food, panoramic views, and history.
Snapchat's animation effect is being criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users every day to change reality and mess with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that's like a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality, and they generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any errors will be published immediately.
Snapchat's filters have in the past earned criticism for allegations that the app promotes blackface or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that made their eyes slant, teeth crooked and faces puffy, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - yellowface.
And they asked if these repeatedly contentious questions pointed to a larger societal problem -- the problem of diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard wrote about it on Wednesday, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said it was shutting down the next day.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an accounting for anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed the racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused without the cover of the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "harmful and embarrassing at the very least".
She added that it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellowface, but that the yellowface is taken to a disdainful extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts -- may mean that you can expect even more sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user", 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, "it's very hard to get away with this stuff like it used to be".
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and phone interview, she said she believes that racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring process.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that there's no diversity in the workforce and people of color when these things are being decided", said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, "or people of color are working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to talk".
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees, although it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like this who can say it's not right, with their account still being deleted.
Military officers distorted intelligence on IS, says parliamentary committee
A parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers from the US Central Command had altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what events in the country were providing.
According to a preliminary report by a task force put together by the Republican chairmen of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence analysts that their superiors were changing their assessment of the U.S. effort to defeat ISIS.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release for the report states: Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when the wrong analysis is presented to senior policymakers", said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The failure of the Centcom leadership reaches to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing US training efforts for Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no conclusive evidence is offered that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be redacted, the report says analysts felt they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, or ISIS.
In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the central staff, statements and statements from the congress were substantially more positive than what the events actually were, the report says.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation", said Congressman Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior US Central Intelligence Agency personnel manipulated the intelligence outputs of the Central Intelligence Agency in order to downplay the threat posed by IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed the task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information pertaining to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by further investigation.
There's a further investigation underway at Centcom Intelligence, led by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which matched some of the findings of the Republican task force.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom established a very narrow process for compiling evaluations of information on IS and Iraqi security forces, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a Democrat representative.
According to Adam Schiff, the process "has led to distortion of intelligence output, damaged morale among analysts and under-considered dissenting opinions".
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to the "draft or political situation".
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general that was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
He said, however, that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues".
The investigation has implications beyond whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (a statement now being claimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can be trusted to honestly evaluate the Central Command's military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIS coverage has mirrored conflicts for more than a decade, with Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper that suggested that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite objections from many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against ISIL refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside the headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate testimony too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The USA have won their fourth straight game of field hockey, so today is the decisive game for Great Britain.
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan and just a day later, she scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in a game that saw the U.S. beat India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure she had ever done anything like that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans are up 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who remained unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who will finish first and second in the six-team group.
The first place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are leading the second group.
Whatever happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have caused a stir with their surprise drive here, four years after finishing 12th in the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took up field hockey at age 3 (her older twin sister played at Drexel) and made the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor her teammates did very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change", said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half with a close-range shot.
India entered the match undefeated in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunities.
She slipped to the left side of the field, then slid into the center and shot a ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez adds the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had one assist in each of her three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
So is Bama.
"We're in a good place now", Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the midst of the Olympic fury
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot relay pole, passed from the pole vaulter to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the up-and-coming facial-dimpled ladies' favorite, is in the Olympics for the first time and could also be among the household names in prime time between commercials and sponsors' spots if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline jump.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same at all competitions.
Farther out from the center, a little bit in the shade, are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have success in the classic swimming style - and it's likely to reign for a long time.
But if I may name my particular favorite, let me point out the subtle charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport has remained almost unnoticed - many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in the trampoline jump, and until 2012, none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prizes in the men's category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year's gold medalists from London will be Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But trampoline jumping is another unlucky event, in part because to the uninitiated ear, it will seem more suited to a clown university than an Olympics.
I must confess I am no expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential -- the comic vibrations of infinite reflection -- but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "trampoline", which means "jumping board".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m] and perform a series of jumps, spins, and combinations before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated by performance, difficulty and time in the air.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medalists must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the finish, sometimes there and back, up and down.
He is trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall but also, as the television news reports, with another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I also find it a little exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline is a relief in this regard.
The athlete's trajectory on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects off as if in a weightless state like an astronaut, flying up, then down, and then back up again without effort.
It's not without competition and, of course, difficulty, but for the duration of the set, there's no fierce competition to reach the goal, no distance measurement, just perfect, graceful flexibility of time and gravity.
This is just as close as the Olympics and Zen get.
The women's qualifying and finals are Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern time, with the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will air the finale as part of the afternoon block, beginning at 2 p.m. both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you're likely to overlook in other fights.
And if attention is to be gained only by the love gaze and embodiment of male athletes - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
 Generations of protesters  in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent government resistance.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it's been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government unrest has swept the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response has been ruthless.
Witnesses say police officers shot and killed a crowd of unarmed protesters.
Circulating video footage of the protests, which probably dates from late last year or early this year, shows security forces beating young people with batons after they were forced to stand up against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a full investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to move forward", said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe, and clean.
But Ethiopia is hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations speak incessantly of government repression - the country's opposition has been suppressed, dissent effectively silenced.
Many were deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But that could change.
"When you strangle people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youths are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
The complaints are many and range from land disputes to absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea, where a conflict along the ill-defined disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings are now rekindled after years of smoking under the surface.
The first is a seemingly harmless one: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have only been able to communicate via social media in recent years, as cheaper smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromos and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amharas, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on the way to a united leadership", said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharic and Oromo people believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, business and politics.
The third cause of the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see through a corner.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of discontent and using envoys to manipulate and win over opponents.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled from relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't trust the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that further bloodshed will result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts described as elections that the government screwed up and then stole.
A heavy crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - though fewer than in previous months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is quite clear that the gradual escalation of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation going on.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked Tigrayan-owned businesses, and anti-Tigrayan hate on social media has become more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The U.S. government has been using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally to break up in an already volatile region.
"That", Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of the blade".
Donald Trump explains his comments about Obama and financing ISIS as "sarcasm".
Donald J. Trump tried to downplay the latest controversy that has plagued his campaign on Friday by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters, who have worked hard to defend him during turbulent times, in an awkward position and must explain that his remarks may not have been serious.
After this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal of a day-old claim that Trump had made in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump tries to focus his campaign on the economy as his preference in the polls plummets.
Trump and Clinton were engaged in a duel over economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
He tweeted again warning that Clinton's proposals were tied to tax increases, and said that some found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm to defend himself before.
In late July, when he drew a wave of criticism for suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his comment by saying, "I'm being sarcastic, of course".
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and tone them down as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing how well some messages are received by his supporters, to see how they respond, and then, depending on the response, he 'provides an explanation' one way or another", said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's very clever in his statements and he knows they're vague enough to be explained in different ways.
With the polls continuing to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more whistle-blowing tone in recent days, rather than softening things up for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump has generally avoided apologizing for provocative statements he makes, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in a difficult position to publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is a legitimate political comment", Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little-known, little organization that he called a total newcomer, and that was because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to tweet around him, raining fire on the media for relaying his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the poor, pathetic television pundits trying to understand him, and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats have taken to Trump's apology as further proof that he is unfit for the presidency.
They've taken the coffee shop off the market, and now it's back in Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe was a seedy place in Williamsburg where you could pay cash, no Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed from the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel looted and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, then it's also rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but it's staffed by some of the original employees and has a similar, modest atmosphere.
The coffee's still good, too.
The new Verbo is managed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a customer offered to pay for a move, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even reused the old verb illumination.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but it offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original stragglers.
"Many of the original customers had to move out of Williamsburg because of the price tag", he said.
Last Sunday, one of our customers was here, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to the Verb Cafe.
It was even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and culture in the verb", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day she had a blended chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devoted Verbe fan since 2003.
He walks in before work and he always orders the same thing.
"I come every day at quarter past eight, like clockwork, and they're already making my steak for me with everything and butter", he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal still orders his usual, but occasionally he'll have bacon, eggs and ham on his plate.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap store took over his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verb a special soap using filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it", said Rodriguez.
The Greenpoint Cafe was also well received by traditional Polish residents.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he wanted to find a place to display it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
There are other advantages to the new location.
A local fruit juice company wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
The possibility of the cafe being extended to the adjacent building is being offered.
Many customers are satisfied with having their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopens, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell", he said.
Depressing food from the Depression - at Square Meal
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Office having lunch.
The greedy President Roosevelt enjoyed the finest foods on Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver patties and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for the day was more modest: Devil's way eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and as a dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering", said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, they're in the food history department.
Andrew Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane's book, 97 Orchards, tells the life story of a Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, upscale buffet in the Flatiron District that's been in business since the Depression, 1929.
Jane (54) ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with sliced olives, Andrew (57) ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes and a mixed vegetable.
A reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was perfect for a conversation about food during a crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular", said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean curd were sold.
They were made from that ingredient and other cheap food that the ingredient set.
Think about how many peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe is a little bit of a jerk.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Depression, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers and served freshly baked cake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal traces the ways a nation coped with suddenly not being a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became the central, dreaded topic for the American people", Coe said in explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budgetary diet was equally feared: Mystery dishes such as meatballs and casserole dishes became common, casseroles being a wonderful way to use up leftovers, Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat -- for many years the centerpiece of American food -- has become a sparingly allocated luxury.
Strange blends, intended to serve as calorie and nutritional fillings, were given priority over taste or even common sense in cooking.
While researching for a book of recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a seasoned dish of roasted onions filled with peanut butter.
"He was not a popular addition to the dinner table", said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman pointed out, "It was surreal".
Peanut butter and roasted onions don't go together.
It was typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before or since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Domestic Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have been driving the nation's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the budget, and turned delicacies like cream spaghetti and carrots into delicious dishes.
The book A Square Meal is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the pastries were created in response to the government's response to its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a cake" pose.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his childhood, he dined like the select millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce", said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly undressed room, wearing a tux.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him follow his own example with his own stomach.
The book tells us that Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, and that resulted in the White House not only serving the most dismal food in all of Washington, but also the most disgustingly prepared.
Many of the eating habits of the Depression were eroded as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our continuing exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - such as why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food", Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "The people were sick of her".
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clear, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream", Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly buried a spoon in the thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then another.
And as a good steward, he said to his wife, "I could use some chopped hairs".

Gilead is entitled to legal representation in the case of the C-yellow patent v. Merck Corporation.
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in a patent case involving hepatitis C against drug maker Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, a judgment ordering Gilead to pay $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found Merck's repeatedly engaged in illegal conduct, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman entered a brief Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming they owned the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of Manbij city
US-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the remaining group of radicals who were hiding in the city left.
The units liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control, but we are still searching it", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2% federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which said the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million and paid an effective tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Clinton donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lecture fees to the fund, and the former Secretary of State acknowledged receiving $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her work at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax returns.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the amount of the tax exemption.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be role models for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign aide.
But Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backing away from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates for president to release their tax returns even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited a US Treasury Department tax audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move", said a Hillary Clinton campaign aide on Twitter, following the Democratic nominee's tax filing.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audits were complete.
According to Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his rejection raises questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including his relations with Russia.
Clinton has been vocal on the issue, releasing a video on Friday reminding senior Republicans of how they are pressuring Trump to release his tax returns.
He'll bring it up in his speech on economic issues in Michigan on Thursday.
"She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - publish their tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying that may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a presidential election issue.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone making more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the motion.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered, Buffett invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also been audited by the IRS and that Trump isn't afraid of the IRS, he's afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal income tax and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, they only make $100 in income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual fund index, from which the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks for elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to keep elephants from entering human habitats - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This has worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this practice and training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania on how to use this nonviolent four-step process to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Many of them used to use spears for defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since they developed this ... toolkit, we have seen a change in behaviour in these communities, with people becoming more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", said Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and second steps are to flash a flashlight on a passing elephant and honk the horn.
If that doesn't deter him, there's going to be a so-called "chilli cloud" eruption.
The chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped with the firecracker in a condom, the end of which is knotted so that only the stick looks out.
When detonated, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chili is dispersed into the air.
Usually, one breath is enough to take the elephant in the other direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker leans on Berlin hotel for removing Israel's dialling code at Arab request - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a media frenzy after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling Israel, according to an employee following "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's dialling code list.
However, the country was not listed as a country to which direct calls from a room could be made.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was eliminated and erased?
It was Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the option of calling Israel through its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and went to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, "shocked me".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was decided after consideration by the management of Kempinski Hotels.
The reason for this move made the director even more excited.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the Israeli dialling code be erased", Lanzmann quoted an employee in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
We were horrified and shocked by what happened.
That in itself is a huge shame.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this is even more shameful.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, he said.
The incident has caused a strong reaction online, with people calling it outrageous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply "lost" itself in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you", says another post, which points out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfurstendamm, is near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the incident "oversight" and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the call codes list", quotes the Suddeutsche Zeitung from the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police occurred in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo State Governor Gerald Alckmin's proposals to save money include closing nearly 100 public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying signs against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff after the country's Senate ruled on her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71 percent - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased 70.9 percent year on year after the lifting of sanctions.
As the Ambassador noted, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are preparing to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russian exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was driven by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and arms, the Ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
In addition, Iran has for the first time entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be surpassed", he said.
But at the same time, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran, and the ambassador hopes that will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the well-preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are", he said.
Scot Callum Skinner hurries home after the British win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland was inducted into the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at Rio Velodrome as the trio of Team GB defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of brake taken over by his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend delighted as he slammed into the goal and stole the victory from the favourite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago, and Hoy won his fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had already ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the substitution for the specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
With Hoye's departure, a vacancy also opened up that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was co-champion with Hoye four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey was taken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going into higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his BBC commentator position and as Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took the podium, he couldn't take his eyes off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison".
I'm here to make the best of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the remark and Britain's opponents had no chance of appeal.
This time around, there was no such problem with this victory.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London".
For the last three months, we've all been here as a team.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have a successful five days ahead of us at the Velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's not inconceivable that he could repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same Olympics.
This would mean a total of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also has a birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred to British sport, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrating their birthdays on this date).
Same as Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will be taking part in a sprint that starts today and will last for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
Team racing is always best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning by yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the 4K team pursuit.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first lap and final time of 22:42 is on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will definitely be focusing on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioner when the referee asked him to measure his height.
In the similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngava set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team GB relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season Olympics and win many medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have eased in the run-up to Rio.
In the background, dramatic events unfolded, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of racing at the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation of the Great Britain team for delivering top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the Portland smelter after the termination of the power supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because the power plant that supplies the company with electricity has informed one of the mill's owners of its intention to terminate its power supply contract.
The move follows a decision by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to extend the subsidies that keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland could be at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs, direct or indirect, could be at risk if the plant were to close.
And since the mill consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity, further avalanche effects can occur.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry distillery in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa distillery in Portland is in a state of disrepair and in danger of closing.
This move follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the plant's production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to a large aluminium smelter, said it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small commercial shares held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the boom in demand for electricity from the smelter will continue, it said.
The Commission notes that the AGL was not involved in the sale of the assets of the company.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017, the power plant said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the AGL is in a similar situation to the AGL.
AGL stated that it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its books at USD 187 million in the event of termination.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract did not affect its ability to operate the distillery or to provide electricity to the distillery.
The American company said it signed Loy Yang to a 20-year contract in 2010 that was to begin in November of this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL's chief operating officer, Stehpen Mikkelsen, who spoke to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer, he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian reality TV show - she's now the cover of glossy Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, the mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, has appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue.
Kendall, an Estee Lauder brand ambassador who has exhibited at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page makes me want to cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover was revealed following a bizarre (or simply humorous continuation of the Kardashian's) staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar-hopping Rob and Caitly and with them their all-time favorite show business uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover, only to end the scene with a classic twist: they're having a secret party.
It's a covered storyline in almost every birthday episode of a children's television show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the 8 a.m. show), but Kris needed to somehow make sure that the other girls in this commercial could make a living.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era for the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall onto the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The issue, which is thicker like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that 615 pages of advertising were available from 832 pages in last year's edition).
The reveal of the star on the cover is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more celebrity models on the cover than celebrity models.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she was honored by Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, or reality show stars, or kids today who know how to make a well-cut video (even though Jenner represents all of that).
These are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who was on the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the former Victoria's Secret model, in June criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
These feelings were rekindled with the news that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you Estee Lauder makeup.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for Love magazine.
And in her spare time, she's doing a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres each year, and the sector itself is set to suffer the consequences of further cuts to funding for already overcrowded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people without the financial means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are rejected the moment they seek free legal help and representation.
Community legal services, already strained to the breaking point, are about to face further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centre, said that a recent summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres found that 5,000 people are turned away each year.
Mr. Farrell said that unless the federal government reverses its decision, the situation will worsen.
"Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need", he said.
People who have escaped abusive relationships, people with excessive and crippling debt, families going through separation, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all these people are having problems with the legal dimension, and this report shows that they don't have a chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent starting in June 2017, leaving thousands more vulnerable people in Queensland to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator for Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately stop this funding cut, so that people can get the help they need if they get into legal trouble.
Last year, the State Government received its commitment to provide legal aid funding up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun at him.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after it was told that a North Carolina operations director pointed a gun at a staff member while riding a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded it wouldn't.
Principal Earl Phillip pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right hand on the trigger and aimed the barrel at Vincent's face, Bordini said in the complaint.
The file says that after lodging a complaint with local and regional campaign officials, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to fire to cause damage", Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners could step in (a provision of the U.S. Second Amendment) if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint her own judges.
The Trump campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
Bordini is suing the campaign for negligent oversight and Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of force and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is a huge attraction, just like London was in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympics were a huge boon to both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We'll create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities alone, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong in Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, starting with Terminal T5 - which was voted the world's best terminal for five years running, to Terminal T2 which was built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now they're ready to deliver a third runway, worth £16 billion in private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I'm confident the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It's time we continued to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure future trade and leave a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Trying to bypass ad-blocking programs has become a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing, says one company that develops ad-blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site saying that users can update their filters and block ads on the social network again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it harder for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are advertising.
Adblock now claims they've bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that this sort of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to get around it has been going on since ad blocking was invented, and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the world's largest social network got involved in the war just goes to show how big of a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people worldwide use ad filters - almost four times the number in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
The spokesperson stated that the company is against desktop ad filters, however, because mobile ad filters for social networking mobile applications and Instagram do not work.
Desktop advertising is still a profitable business, so Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people better control over how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about new Adblock filters because they could also block non-ad-related content on the site.
"It's not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail statement.
Ad blocking is a non-sensitive tool, so we've focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses to a woman who was struck by several vehicles on a freeway early Thursday morning, apparently trying to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of "Desperate Housewives" was lying in the dark on the road and was hit by several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, was about to kill herself when she was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died instantly.
Several drivers have been questioned, but police say they have not yet identified all of them.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a logical step in a situation like this, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Genève.
It remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Could the collision have been prevented?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out, Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it seems that the drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one involving a person walking on a freeway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian to cross the freeway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of manslaughter after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paynerne on an August 2014 night.
The court records show that the victim, aged 22, drank alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the distress call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20 thousand visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of the AČCKA, Katerina Petříčková, announced this.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and wide range of specialist businesses", Petříčková said.
According to the organizers' survey, foreign visitors spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
To support gay tourists in their travels, special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants are available in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price ranges with high standard of tourism services and spending more than others", Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also being held as part of the festival programme this year.
It will feature speakers from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also cover several thematic areas, such as the family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade with allegorical carriages on Saturday, which will start from Wenceslas Square on Letna.
The parade, which has drawn thousands in recent years, will hold a minute's silence this year in memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where a gunman shot and killed 49 people, mostly gay.
Pat and Matt are celebrating their 40th anniversary.
The irresistible, cuddly Pat and Matt, whose endeavors usually end in disaster, have entertained audiences young and old for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series directed by Lubomir Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
The animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries, was created by cartoonist and director Lubomir Beneš, who created the jokes for the magazine with two titles Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited playwright Jiří Kubík and artist Vladimir Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The current form with yellow and red trick and ball and radio received the characters in 1979, when the short film Prague began to develop a series for Slovak television.
Pat and Mat were given the names in 1985, this time they were shot directly for the short film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where he created other works.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creators continued, many of them with Beneš's son Marek.
There are currently over ninety episodes of stories of these cuties who are all over the place, but never angry with themselves, and are always full of optimism, ideas and cutie enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, as evidenced by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Matt have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theater, and the characters and other toys featuring Pat and Matt are a hit with every toy company.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
This weekend is all about fairy tales, so we've picked one for you, one for sports and one for life.
They both have happy endings.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved a historic feat.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the things people spend the most on at airports?
That's Friday's feed from the World Wide Web.
First medal of the Olympics.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating a historic achievement.
The rugby team of this archipelago defeated the Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
This is Fiji's first ever Olympic medal.
The wait for the first precious metal to be produced has been going on for 60 years since the first expedition to the Olympics was sent.
Coach Fiji gets a lot of credit for the success.
Ironically, the Brit is Ben Ryan.
The team has been in the lead since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be satisfied unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play it cool and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history", the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually took over sovereignty, and the small nation of 900,000 now lives an Olympic fairy tale.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported.
New friend and good luck to the little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me", a two-year-old girl said, as her mother told ABC News.
She said that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without the prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B less than a year old, and doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing about her I wouldn't love.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He's also very perceptive.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words, "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands", her mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that airports are the place where people spend the most money on bottled water.
Hudson's Travel Essentials has released data for the past year that summarizes the 10 most frequently purchased products by customers at its airport stores.
Water was sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place went to the large box of coconut-flavored M&M's.
And can you guess who's closing in on the top ten?
It's the only one of these things that you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among them are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond were laughing.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been crowned world champions in the two-man rowing event for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio Olympics.
The seemingly mismatched pair have gone on to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, they claimed their 69th consecutive win in the quarterfinals.
How are we different from the others?
We're just prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta when asked about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We just trained hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is six feet tall and a hundred pounds, the academically-looking Bond is five inches shorter and 15 pounds lighter.
And they have different personalities.
Bond is a student and a financial professional. Murray has a charity boxing match.
Even so, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's boarding the ship with the basic idea that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
"I tend to think about what could go wrong", Bond admitted, even making a point at the press conference that Murray was the dominant crew member.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
But on the water, he destroys his opponents with calm force.
They are at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through the race, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile in a row.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 34-year-old Murray.
With his partner, four years his junior, he won seven gold medals at the world championships.
They triumphed in 2007 when both members of the Golden Four were at the helm without a helmsman.
It was after an unexpected failure at the Beijing Olympics a year later that the larger crew decided to move to the two-man crew without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they may have recovered from the biggest defeat of their careers, and they confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask any questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a ride, and we had to make sure we were mentally fit, Murray said.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us.
We still have the target on our back.
But we try to stay one step ahead of everyone else, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections from NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, could once have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that Venus may once have had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth's, but it rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical diversity to support life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
In the GISS model, Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time during a slow rotation, explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella to shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than what we have on Earth today.
The model has constructed a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of billions of years -- it was exposed to extreme heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy has resigned as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will begin the search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent a long, long time over the summer thinking about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the VP of hockey operations be aligned with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect team performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who took Roy in on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has been losing in the postseason for the past two years.
The Avalanche's 2015-16 season was 39:39:4 and they were five points short of earning their second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
Goalie Roy, who made the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and end strike
Top officials from the negotiating parties said that the strike for the wages of the North Sea oil workers was suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have sporadically taken place on the North Sea rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements, says the statement.
Starting next week, we're going to have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks where we're going to try to look at the issues from new angles.
According to the unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up 30 percent in protest of wage cuts.
Wood Group has reduced rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less this year due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates follows a 10% reduction for offshore companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the companies room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has written off thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation, which led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some", he said in a statement.
By comparison, almost $1.4 billion in new investment projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds, and how rotation time is related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between stellar mass, age and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood, having formed some 125 million years ago.
Now it's spinning fastest.
At the moments of maximum rotation, these fledgling stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds travel along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation rate slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- like sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation rates, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens stars to dancers, the bigger ones doing the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades, we see that the slowest-spinning stars are more massive, while the fastest-spinning ones are usually very light", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they serve as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and their rotation rates.
"The Pleiades provide an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars", Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation and so they say, "hang their dancing shoes on the nails".
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation rate in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't apply, then wouldn't the qualification agreement be made and I could move to another hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without applying for specialised training?
The point is that the job I want to work in is now only available in a hospital a little further away, but in about six months there may be a job opening in another hospital where I would like to work.
So I'm not sure how to handle the situation for about six months, the question goes.
This is Monsignor Lenka Wolková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in increasing or improving the employee's qualifications.
In the health sector, there is a long-standing pressure to avoid such agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require such an agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising the professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, participation in specialised training is considered to be a qualification enhancement (not an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs are at least CZK 75 000.
There is no legislation or obligation to enroll in specialised education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for admission to specialised education.
The law does not, however, allow a doctor to practise as a doctor if he has completed the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the supervision of a doctor with specialised qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for the situation in which a professional practice in another field of specialization may be included in the specialist training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would be in line with the applicant's situation.
However, in view of the lack of detailed information on the circumstances of this case, it is recommended to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides by law advice and consultation services related to the placement and the course of specialised education.
The consultation service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Association, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Aleppo, Syria are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (rebel areas of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, the letter to the White House quoted AFP as saying.
"We don't need tears, sympathy, or even prayers; but we desperately need a no-fly zone over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Aleppo is not besieged again", the doctors said.
Russian forces backing the army loyal to President Bashar Assad have announced that they will stop daily strikes in the Aleppo area for three hours from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELC, all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire will be stopped.
While welcoming the move, UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors working in eastern Aleppo, which is already under rebel control, have contacted Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, brutal deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and recognizing how complicated Syria is, but it's doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like thinly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of which were on the hospitals where they work.
The sad thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have small children coming into the ER with injuries so severe that we have to choose from among them those most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the materials to help them, doctors say.
Two weeks ago, four newborns died of asphyxiation when an explosion cut off oxygen to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath and then their lives ended - before they could really begin, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded rebel-held eastern Aleppo in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies.
Rebels, under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, broke through the siege on Saturday after three weeks and launched a counter-offensive.
Both sides then added reinforcements in and around the city.
