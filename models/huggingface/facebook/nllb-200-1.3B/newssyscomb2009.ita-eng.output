The right-wing populists in Austria: 29%
The noticeable weakening of both parties in the grand coalition and the marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party, in which the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaking, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärnten prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), with 29.8% of the vote, but losing 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the case for ÖVP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, who have brought about early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage over the SPÖ in their preferences.
But the voters obviously punished them for bringing down the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary party leadership meeting.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ-ÖVP coalition.
As for the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) won 18% and the BZÖ 11% of the vote in advance - the Social Democrats also revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people to a collective government, (the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
This is clearly the case with Mr Haider, who has already said that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he expects a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens also managed to enter Parliament, but fell slightly, dropping from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously crossed the 4% threshold and not entered Parliament.
The EU's relations with India may cool
If the problem cannot be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal collection of beetles in India, there will be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then there will be a certain cooling off", he said after the meeting, which was held on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly meddle in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which is under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem might be solved", said the Minister.
Mukherjee said it would be better for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then you can apply for bail and await your sentencing.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain a pardon", said the Czech foreign minister.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a keen interest in maintaining the best relations with India that we have had for many years.
The Indians also admit it", said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he declared.
The Minister avoided answering the question whether he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've gotten relatively many promises", he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It is approaching the electronic map on the wall that shows Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent but in a tiny spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Law.
His boss, the Czech lawyer Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It's a workaround and a passion.
The seafloor still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, metallic minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms that have been unknown until now, and that carry the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on land
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
The UN convention is that they are taking advantage of the laws that were agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the case in the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country concerned.
That is the one who has the exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea, often over 200 nautical miles", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical and scientific documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful", adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia's dramatic expansion of its marine holdings has been echoed around the world.
But New Zealand has also gained - the area of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, is about 1 square kilometre, so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profits from the seabed, as they promise, will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years from the time the Montego Bay Convention was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention has declared a common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right to extract gold in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike", says director Mikulka, exaggerating, "with its individual parts legally demarcated and their regime contractually established".
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other former Soviet bloc states within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
In 1991, the company, like investors from a few other countries, acquired the status of a pioneer investor under the convention.
It has mining rights in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is crumpled, it's almost a submerged replica of the Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on a total surface of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic aggregates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", explains another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division, Rober Sandev, is bringing an artifact to show it.
It looks like a little potato or a little fantasy, a legendary pattern, like in the legend of the Golem's awakening.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages. The experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special forces were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are receiving more and more detailed information on the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 European hostages.
The rescue operation was carried out by German special units, as reported by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists, GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Bureau as well as logistics experts from the technical institution were present on the spot.
As the spokesman for the ministries said Monday night, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, in view of the danger of a forceful intervention, released the hostages and fled.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join in as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there by luck", says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On 19 September, in southern Egypt, attackers kidnapped a group of travellers: five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained secret until the end as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The liberated, meanwhile, arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't elaborate on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 holidaymakers and special units are expected to fly out with an Airbus of the military air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The upper house of the US Congress has just failed a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
By 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, which would have curbed the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the supporters have tried desperately to persuade critics of the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the deputies to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
It's hard to be grateful for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet.
While the vote was in progress the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
THE reason for the investors' concern was that the state bailout package might fail.
It recovered before the vote was over and then, after the bankruptcy was announced, it collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on international financial markets.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
Promoters record increasing bookings
It looks like it 's going to be a good winter for German tour operators .
According to one study, travel booking turnover for the coming months has increased markedly compared with the previous year - by more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, a survey shows that German travellers are still keen.
The German tourism association DRV reported on Monday in Berlin that bookings for the winter season by travel agencies increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
According to the survey by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
The surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would therefore amount to around 11%, the DRV reported.
The assumption for these results is the figures from GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and produces statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany, would be particularly sought-after destinations for Germans.
In particular, all-inclusive travel is highly valued, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs of energy and food, the costs in this case would be 'better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday'.
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months also reported good booking figures, with a turnover surplus again compared to the previous year - although a further study shows that the number of Germans who took a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, beer from a pint and VIPs in taped Dirndl.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I'm dark-haired, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But we have one thing in common: just three minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras.
That 's how you make friends .
The cheap Dirndl seems to be getting its way.
As a visitor to Wiesn and a resident of the north of the equator of the white sausages, the sense of well-being in costume/clothing is still within limits.
And once we get to Theresienwiese, it's not a big deal.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed  all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron gets weird looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun pointed out that I had tied the apron wrong: "Left you are free, in the middle you are virgins, right you are engaged, behind widow".
Suddenly I'm turning my fuse from back to left.
All right", he says and laughs.
Others make a lesser waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, with the words "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare buttocks at an uninvited person.
The boy with the show-offs is Bob, from England, and he's also visiting Oktoberfest for the first time.
She thinks it's gorgeous, with a dash of "ooooo".
This he tells me, after he got rid of his beer-bucket from a pint he had drunk earlier.
Right next to one of these fireplaces, which everyone thinks is a dumpster.
Bob is one of those infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not so fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around 8 p.m. the health workers, who have to take care of the poor, walk in packs on the party square.
The nurses show up every time in a pack, always 4 at a time, dragging a tray covered in tent to tent.
This works like most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the curtain in this coffin of blood alcohol, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the paramedics shouts and disappears into the mess.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on a charge of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands in a row between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking out at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decayed.
But once inside the ticket office from ceiling to vault, there is no doubt about the greatness of the enterprise of what was the most westerly passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran from Damascus to Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and Dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the station at Hyderpasha.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen into disrepair, largely overtaken by history.
But today, this railway junction to Anatolia and all the points to the east serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
Now there is a new policy of engagement.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car for the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a spinning run along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadence of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a centuries-old state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built on purpose - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and power-pickers, where business executives - both men and women - meet to make contracts in the early morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Full suit, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today, you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one or the other.
It must be both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey", he says, "does not want to face that choice".
And then he makes a point that almost everyone I spoke to here has recited from memory: that the ties of the EU not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, all of Europe can metaphorically run those rail lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in the dark, I think of those two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions may now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed no question as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country.
Remembered Lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director from 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 11 September) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/under-21, but by the time Proteus played its final in 1979, many of us were in our 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that music had to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, unaccompanied or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard, it kept it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be knighted, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with a single one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal grandeur and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "rid around the world on one or two well-known war horses".
So many of us will miss him.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... studying simultaneously for a degree in science, a degree in letters and a PhD".
This follows from the author's note in Woodruff's Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in the documentary style, are extraordinary.
They caught my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with special respect.
A show that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magic moments".
Second round of Honda sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with a large capacity, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
Added to this is a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically very similar to the previous model, there are many changes to this minivan.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we analyse the new model, it is worth noting that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation entered the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow for increased sales in the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell about 2,000 Jazz units in a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company expects to reach 22,000 units sold by the end of the year, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do this, Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters (4.37 feet) long - that the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the USA, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately following the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and its cross-sectional area 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also enlarged.
This advantage is due to the introduction of a new platform and the introduction of a central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the double-backed luggage compartment  rises to 399 litres, or 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the dimensions of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both mechanisms include i-VTEC technology which allows for lower fuel consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions, better mechanics and at the same time maintains high engine torque at all stages.
The 1.2-litre model allows a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion  which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared with the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, now 100 are available.
The 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
In the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken its inspiration from nature, and in particular from bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that can avoid accidents by taking the flight of bees as an example.
It's the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this tiny robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general director of PR for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the four-area Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the compound eyes of bees, which can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly uninterrupted in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they call a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C within a radius of two metres and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor which immediately prevents the collision.
"As soon as it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right angle or higher to avoid a collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot swerve up or down, nor even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and without exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the memorization of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can run seamlessly and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and we're not talking about mega-bugs".
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trembling Before Applying for a Loan
We must admit that the US Treasury Department, besides having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from getting involved in junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvencies, they created a fun and educational game for Internet users called "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel"... or the trouble.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but twice or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
The information the game provides is certainly useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a teenage site than a general audience site.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a bingo room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house is not even a word...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, to invest $9 billion in a 21 percent stake in the company, following a sharp decline in its stock market shares.
One week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a cost of $25.25 each, or a sum equivalent to $3 billion.
The price fixed is 19% below the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of USD 31.25 and ensure a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has stated that the overall transaction would be carried out at an average price of $29 per share, which is 28 per cent below its current price.
At 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into a bank holding company", explained John Mack, managing director of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to differentiate its stock, but still bring it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious stance than they previously assumed.
The details of Monday's meeting also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our equity stake would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will acquire the Morgan Stanley securities at a price 7% below their book value.
The transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.'
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to establish a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had 'significantly' reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group under a lot of pressure, with the value of its shares falling by half and the cost of risk insurance soaring.
The price was still high on Monday, at around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa is in Quito, we're on Monday.
To build the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
On Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he gave his voice to the draft of a new constitution.
This is accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of the electorate voted 'yes' in the referendum, on a basis of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, while 7% of the votes were cast as a draw and 0.7% as blank ballots.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a landslide victory for the "yes" vote, with 63% to 70% voting.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night between Sunday and Monday.
"The Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted in a calm manner by the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a 444-point text designed to consolidate the "new socialism" advocated by the President.
This draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on oil extraction by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, who was elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and has the possibility to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to stand for re-election in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free of charge, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo. I'm going to the hospital.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were immediately transferred by helicopter, without any chance of giving any press interviews, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for testing.
They are in "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19th during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been rocked from hiding place to hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organising agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the assault during the night, shortly before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others escaped", said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "lightning" were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of Italian intelligence and special forces.
We have to admit that if we have achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence men, the special forces", he said, without adding further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army patrol had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
The army claimed that the kidnappers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the army.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
On the front page is a debate on the financing of culture, which is the focus of the current election campaign.
That's good.
But part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out against the meager sums given to the small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting heritage monuments and buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros just to restore the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec has at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archival and heritage heritage, are preserving, with four dollars, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate developers and decision-makers bulldoze our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will history and heritage be given the right space?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping to partially nationalise the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to run into difficulties as a result of the crisis in the American credit market. The three countries will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the bank, which will also provide interest-bearing insurance in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands reached an agreement at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the difficulties which have been debated in the international financial market for more than a year is that of Fortis, and in some respects the decisions taken in this regard may set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's stake in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch bank ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis shares started with a vertical collapse, then serious signs of a crisis in the institution appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow itself to go bankrupt.
The bank's stock fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Taking into account current share prices, the total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's management this value is not real.
The company's top executives blame the collapse of Fortis' shares on uncertainties in the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the stock slowly started to rise again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had previously ensured that investors should not fear losing their money.
The bank's customers did not panic, and the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary Fortis has independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The Fox in the Chicken coop
Life and health insurers in America, based on people's medical purchase records, often refuse to take out an insurance policy.
Privacy experts fear the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy policy that the use of prescription data is always subject to the consent of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like leaving the chicken coop to the fox", writes the Washington Post, quoting Richard Dick, author of the program to follow prescriptions for medicines.
The insurance companies depend on the health of the potential customer for the insurance rate and the amount of the claim in the event of a loss and do not insure if they consider the risk to be too high.
In the past, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the results of the examination.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of the European Social Fund, which is a Community instrument for the development of the social dimension.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this means that your blood fat level is practically unmanageably high and you are classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the programme in the market, some of which also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not have much to do other than paperwork, even if there are minor difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for more than one purpose, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is a factor in increasing risk, the first two are not.
Separate companies have been set up to collect and process data and, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have not yet imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to data on the use of medicines to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a separate privacy law but it only applies to health care and insurance.
There is a bill before Congress that gives the authorities oversight over companies that specialize in data services.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough. He has therefore developed a program that links the data transfer with the consent of the data subject.
The other issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not make the contract.
So then the chickens are finally left to the mercy of the fox.
French food
EU and India double trade
As the European Union and India are trading partners, above all with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this issue, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power which should be given a greater say in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this issue was not stressed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, acting President of the Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade to up to EUR 100 billion over five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also get started in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance the balance because while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for a UN conference.
They have urged the conclusion of the Doha round on trade, even though both sides played a role in its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will continue to pursue its energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as the fact that a global agreement should be reached at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today where a bilateral meeting is being held to prepare for the signing of a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French firms will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our news agency, the deal is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, over 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7 000 exhibitors from 101 different countries to take up the 171,790 square metres of the fair with over 403 000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, with an institutional presence at Punto Italia - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
The press conference will follow in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse, where figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy will be presented.
According to the data, the share of books by foreign authors in total Italian production, and in particular in adult and children's books, is gradually decreasing.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, was found flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson, who has yet to be named, said: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the very plane Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The US Transportation Safety Board (TSB) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, and that they identified the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned his place in history through a long string of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without stopping.
Among his many records, he has flown to an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the commercial you don't expect
An off-the-wall SUV with an original design, well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, this is the last of the "compact" off-road cars from the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new lease of life in this sector.
Precisely for its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17 will be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affection, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture, you'd think the car would be out of the way.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reconstituted into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will this formula be able to arouse the interest of future buyers?
That 's who the Italian hooligans are .
They're from Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Blue for years and that so far, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
He's never had a fight with the opposing fans.
Group extraction is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added small groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags with the militants' hometowns on them, but they were removed on Saturday night to avoid identification.
They're inspired by the English fanfare.
In Bulgaria they found a fan club of real Nazis, the Levsky's.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominally, so easily verifiable.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four Blues fans, who had a record of stadium offences, had been denied their tickets and prevented from transferring.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the documents that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents people from attending not only Italian stadiums but all of Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God for that.
But now there is the fear of emulation: that to those just over 150 others will be added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way", they argue from the Viminale.
So, "keep your eyes peeled especially in view of Wednesday's National team game in Lecce".
In fact, in Puglia there is a small group of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"Doce-Duce choruses and an outstretched arm during the Mameli anthem?
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he took the place of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously mayor of Trieste, where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to insult the Duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds No. 1 of the Observatory.
Until now this group has been in line, now we will look closely at what has happened and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to the Mameli anthem: those are not a crime either, but if you'll excuse me, they're not education...
