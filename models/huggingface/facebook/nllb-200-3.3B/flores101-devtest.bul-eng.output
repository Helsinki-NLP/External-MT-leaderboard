Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have found that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed handle called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers - branching and tapering - the researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature control or parade. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not chicken feathers.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult rather than the plumage of a juvenile.

Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: the voters are isolated in the voting booth, indicate the candidate they have chosen on a pre-printed sheet of paper and put it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are released except those of duly registered voters entitled to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The road where the accident happened is temporarily closed so that emergency services can remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be discredited because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they disseminate photos and so on of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has indicated to reporters that until an indictment is filed, no further comment will be made.
According to leaked information, the document will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine is claiming based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are believed to be the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for five years only.
The arrows in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was observed and its efficacy evaluated.
The Sport Shooters Association of Australia's hunting program has hired qualified volunteers in partnership with NPWS and Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of "Conservation and Heritage" at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot were given detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the nine-member new interim board of electors yesterday.
This is the fifth interim election board for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the former CEC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod malfunction, overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating that the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "a real regret".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if you administer a hormone, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Poor tribute to Luna and fellow warriors.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extremist Queen. My first manager. Luna went away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman".
"Moon is as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'm going to miss her...hope she's in a better place", commented Dustin Goldstorm Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose the idea of Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
After all, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints his fitness is in question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage the pain, as it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA says that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow flight managers to provide pilots with more accurate information and determine the exact location of aircraft.
There is no additional transport and no overland trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or parking facilities on site to allow the vehicle to be left.
The fear of lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A new species of bird has been spotted in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwinian finch, the mid-earth finch (Geospiza fortis) and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shape, can be rolled into any shape.
It can be pulled like a thin wire that can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal -- so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is the pH of a chemical substance, and using the juice of a red cabbage, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, the green juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then mold them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and you'll feel a little weird, and it'll form something like a shell.
The towns of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected by an elaborate sewer system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, the remains of sewer systems were found.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite when you're calling someone thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back to us almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the biggest thing we have because of the wheel is a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic free-ranging cats) that feed on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is their concept of the niche, a special job that each cat holds, which keeps them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called pride.
The swarms consist of one to three adult males with blood ties, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually close-knit, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five healthy humans.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that have a distinctive roar.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the lion's roar, but it is more like a roar of roaring, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find prey by scent, asking where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly, the survivors hunt their prey, blending with their surroundings and pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, just as we make clothes from them, and most of our edible food is plants, and without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Mosasaurians.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the top of his mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a tongue split, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that came into the water, and it was a giant dinosaur like T. Rex that couldn't compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had many strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called sleeping giants.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, lying on the side while eating.
It is not possible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a prime temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life takes place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just shelves facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not covered with forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of its discovery, by that time, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
You might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you watched the movie "National Treasure".
It's not a treasure map, although there's something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is shown in the lower part of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is most likely that the notation was added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was free, but the south was still not free.
It's run by the French from Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern France and advanced on Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large and significant group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", and is related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas", which is "city" or "city-state", and that somehow determines the size of society.
City-states were the precursors of nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with, according to the Articles of Confederation, Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since it had no national judicial or executive power, it relied on government agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
Nor does it have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all the states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often called an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in local grain production customs and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intikiwatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the borders of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. a group of APS formats).
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most appropriate location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into a third vertical and a third horizontal (See example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, already rich and powerful, was under attack.
The Christian religion has bound European nations together for over a thousand years, despite their differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
It is a basic Christian principle that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds exist for that very reason.
The centralization of the church in Rome lasted for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been observed.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated common international law, codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, an attitude of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Nations wanted to avoid a war situation again in the future, having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I.
In order to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with a 4-cent piece in his pocket, a poetry collection, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Butchler (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of showing different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each of the two dynasties, there was also a period of unstable divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state is of the people, not just of a ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the division in the army being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things beyond this worldly life, and to meditate he often visited the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located atop a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, once you're inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the late pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to his wives and family members.
The upper sign looks like a V, and the lower sign is a ruler or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start from the top and press the bow, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and then pull it out.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put your own signs, but remember that the printed bow strokes are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women in the market.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves have paid the military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the cost and interest of the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main acquisitions of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The period during which the events occurred is usually called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 CE).
The true Middle Ages are preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice - from the technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared by most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself goes on a path far beyond cultural or political influence, or that technology itself influences inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
So, for example, one could say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
A national road network, however, would not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars has also led to a higher rate of road accidents, which has necessitated the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a great element of cultural determinism, which was pioneered by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose associated with that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury dates from about 400 BC and continued until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silks, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of "Capital of Fashion" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow communication, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button their clothes, which was one of the great developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried on to produce enough food for the sole needs of the farmer and his family.
Market agriculture is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological area, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The signs that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used tools to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, ill-treatment or intentional violence, were not socialized by adults during the children's growing up period.
Some untamed children were kept confined by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of training but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scales, like the little man with the staples in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are designed to ask questions, to suggest and to explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving people to care for, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that was needed in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the use of the 'satisfaction' approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his book "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out how even people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive the sincere attitude.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the 20th century showed that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to meet its amino acid needs through available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are severe: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of the legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (termite, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up at your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your watch in your bedroom, you can put it on the other side of the room, and you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and his spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own stress and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayan way of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and after the war, differences in system, process and culture led to conflict between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next 40 years, and was fought in real battle by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian beachhead and reconsider its organization.
These plans, however, became invalidated almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having conquered the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of a naval fleet is traditionally to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move people and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mostly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably conquered Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, usually children or young boys, like the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to achieve greater speed and to pull larger loads than the rougher roads characteristic of the time.
Travers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually understood that the rails would be more effective with an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Wood wheels were gradually replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of movement was walking, with humans walking upright starting two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally, join the environmental movement and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advancement, and problems have been made worse by overcrowding and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to his troops on July 9th in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 one-sided copies of Dunlap on large sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today, and we call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still look like dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have legs with claws and scales, and they walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and they lay their eggs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always manifest immediately, but symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose immediately.
The presence of an open container of a drug or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term bug is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from a distant acquaintance with the woodpecker, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Like the flying beetles, the common beetles are colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the event of adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can be the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, experiments are used, asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and especially with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek scholarship declined, the West was cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform the free-flowing cycle even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading theories that suggested that DNA was genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in cells in the germ line can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive for people with an interest in visiting natural areas in order to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to work, people travel from small country towns by car, and they pass others whose work destination is the place the first ones have just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is to some degree connected to and maintains a transportation system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years is now being demonstrated by science.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about the quality of the water or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they break down daily, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since the behaviour of drivers unfortunately cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty, studying the flow of traffic is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus traffic flows have a certain logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better understand the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the planning, design and ultimately operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies, and their ability to fly helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and the day-fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think that he is right, but many hold the opposite view - that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in places.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the stone pyramid boom continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the least populated and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those working in the state.
All the subjects of the Vatican are Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, which in turn is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So when it first came out, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and use.
People today write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The plutonium bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, then splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they tend to break up with little or no boost.
The lunar surface is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more sea on the near side because the crust is thinner there, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on finding out what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by their arrival into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory are two popular theories of content.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, it's possible for two behaviors to emerge: on the one hand, there are those who are trying to stay "I'm one of our boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty with disciplinary actions, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and demanding accountability from people.
You become, on the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and Lafastaud, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team, to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments in an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the organisation's workflow to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process in service of the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organisational learning and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition is provided by the neurobiological data, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior has supported the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a great importance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science dealing with the learning, behavior and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some examples that can be listed are control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These kinds of problems have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system, which is embedded in several home computers and video game software applications, is already widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a web page for their trip to the state capitol, and every year, that web page is re-designed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog, to avoid criticism, has started to strive to improve his writing.
Also, blogging 'forces students to become more aware of the world around them'.The need to nurture the interest of the public inspires students to be interesting and clever (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, students can be empowered to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions, and also outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating and bilingual capital, home to a number of art galleries and museums where you can see Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All of these things solidify Ontario as a model of what it's like to be Canadian to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited deserts.
One population comparison that surprised many: the number of African-Americans in the United States is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the "Bridge of Good Hope", the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveller declare herself to be married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can create situations that they consider to be harassment, in which they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic harbour called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beyda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, narguillas and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as far east as Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a "bodo-bodo" (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Timbuktu, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has gained use as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and its airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS Henry Louis Gates Special Wonders of the African World.
The city is sharply different from the rest of the country because it has an Arab look rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends eastward along the border with Mozambique, northward to Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 distinct ecoregions, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Generally all South African national parks require daily fees for park entry and conservation.
It may also be helpful to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be worth visiting.
The row of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong resemble a sparkling pillar-shaped diagram that protrudes from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists appropriated, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, you might as well start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and this part of the forest, which is on Indian soil, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, almost one third of which is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
The shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travelling for short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
Two masts rise to 273 feet, the length is 1,300 feet, with two sails 12 feet wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous tribe in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Gigantic Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its self-contained character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Ground.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be viewed here at other times of the year.
Check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley against the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within Stanley credit cards.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and American currency may be used; speak to the host beforehand to find out which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months normal temperatures are above +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the combined wind and moisture make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, be at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they appear, buffalo, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't get in their personal space.
In addition, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking flavored food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia, the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
In 1889, the port was the site of a scandalous naval clash when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Ma'u movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
Because Oakland is crossed by two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for bathing, and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are off the waterfront of the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers districts of Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The main local beer is Number one. It is not a heavy beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. Manta is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian may pass better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
The idea of "plain white coffee" is foreign to Australians, with the black cup being "espresso", the cappuccino being rolled up with cream (not foam), and the tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to the Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many of the walks to the reef are year-round, and reef accidents caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, please heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube-shaped jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the city, 1770; occasionally they can be found outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their primary habitat is along the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find other accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They may also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to go in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival stages that will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping sites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as for the most affected, crossing the ice causes quite a terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Usually, casinos put a lot of effort into getting guests to spend as much time and money as possible.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the room, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free drinks, but drinking affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you can't drive as smoothly as on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or hail, and by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frost and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous throughout the year.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are the final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a journey by land to explore the amazing African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, and a good view is obtained with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "wildlife walk", "tourist safari", or "walking walk") is a walk lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the season was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a cast iron and ironing board that can be used even if there are no irons in the room.
If you don't have a spade or don't want to wear socks, you can try using a dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the tissue to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several minutes are required.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals in themselves that can hurt or kill people with force are not normally classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated outlying areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or next sections, where they are usually 35  40 mph (56  64 km/h) and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Curiously, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to those made in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being used year-round, and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want some small, though rich, pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfankuchen or krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curry is often made with yogurt; in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is the most common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further definitions, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simple spiced dishes, and the predominant flavours that Javanese people prefer are hot peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The arrows are the supports for the rider's legs, which are suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
In the event of a rider being thrown off a horse and his foot getting caught in the stirrup, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First of all, most riders wear power-driven boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the skin of the saddle to fall off if it's pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley, the best climbing destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and canaries.
The towers include breathtaking views from the tops, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes amid the endless potential of the walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, better known as "ski booms", planning entire holidays related to skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. The cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first sport ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski tourism.
They are similar, but do not usually involve alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering, the latter being on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a tourist trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly more distances than if you walk  but you will very rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack on supported trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent states.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a state in this respect.
While in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through the passport control points again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen Member States, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition of what is considered an antique, but some tax agencies define antiques as items over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences where the age limit may be smaller in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft goods can be considered antiques, although they are not as old as antique mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture around this livelihood is important for many other crafts as well.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they did survive by fishing, hunting and the like, with the deer being predominantly pack animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades, and tourism is a lucrative industry in Sampi, one of the Sami areas.

The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems or loss of human life.
Anywhere in the world, the weather can be harsh, and its manifestations are very different and can depend on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snow, ice and sandstorms.
Travellers should take into account any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these may affect any travel plans.
Any person planning to visit a country that may be designated as a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company is likely to be provided when searching the internet for a 'hostile environment course'.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and usually combined with practice.
The course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid activities and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Passengers planning a sex-change operation abroad should make sure they have valid return documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to people with undetermined gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender is different.

Transgender people who are about to undergo surgery should not be expected to pass the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Dead currents are the returning flow of waves that break off the shore, often at a reef or something.
The backflow, because of the underwater topology, is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there can be a rapid current to the deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which is probably impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't be caught again or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skill and whether you've been spotted.
The return shock occurs more quickly than the culture shock (there is a shorter phase of the honeymoon), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a relatively easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
When you come home after living abroad, where you've adapted to a new culture, you've lost some of the habits of your home culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers to a new country would have to adjust.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.

The sphinx serves as a background and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are represented on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, with King George Island and the village of Villa Las Estrellas as the largest islands.
Others include Livingston Island and the Outpost, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, then rise again to form the 360-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, or Sentinel Ridge, is Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with Vinson Peak reaching 4,892 m (15,960 ft).
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and in direct view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote and voice data.
More information on how to contact this service can be obtained from your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to skip a year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular among high school graduates, which gives them a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad in your last year of study would improve your chances of obtaining a university degree in your home country.
There is usually a 'training' fee to enrol in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for yachts, the smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where one boat for every seven or eight people is dropped.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is 1 to 40).
Most high-profile Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you land using excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
It is not something to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears and hatreds of other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding the way aircraft work and what happens during flight can help to overcome a fear of the unknown or of a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly, and often time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, and for the smaller companies, that's been a problem.
If they're airlifting, on some routes, unloading and going through customs can take days.
The only way to get through this quickly was to send it as checked baggage, since airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a fat wad of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: in principle you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy business fare and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for business or first-class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of going somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovskaia Moldavian Republic, which, although having its own government and currency, is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.

The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a dense forest of mostly beech, spruce and fir with a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude, there is an extremely wide variety of plant communities.
The area has also sheltered an extremely diverse range of animals and birds.
There are rare species of fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mule, along with many other common species
During their visit to the monasteries, women are obliged to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
The clothes can be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but they are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
As in similar areas in the Mediterranean, the Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available product such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie - Vi, are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Since light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, even in its heyday, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in the present day.
Most modern survey telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good weather.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
It's tradition to spend Easter night awake in the open to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's also possible that it represents a pre-Christian springtime fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregation often starting a lively celebration with the arrival of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on the islands originally came here by swimming, flying or sailing.
