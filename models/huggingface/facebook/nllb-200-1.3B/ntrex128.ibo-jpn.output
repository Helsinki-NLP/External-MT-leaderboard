There is concern in some AMs for consideration that their names should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It started as a result of a plan to change the name of the local council to the Welsh Assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that it could lead to scandal.

For book fighters outside Wales: In Welsh twp means piece, pwp means poison.


In this sense the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Commission of the National Assembly, which drafted the legislation to introduce the name change, stated:The final decision and any interpretation of what is called the Members of the National Assembly shall be the matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Assembly was given the power to change its name by the Welsh Government's 2017 Wales Plan.


AMs are definitely suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach an agreement may be a headache for Chief Operating Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a written order for the changes in the coming weeks.
The amendments will include further changes to the way the national assembly works, including rules for the dismissal of AMs and the architecture of the party system.

St. Martin's Bell Falls as Harlem Church in the National League The Church of St. Martin is Falling Down as Harlem Church in the National League is Falling Down
Old story, the elders I spoke to said that there were bars and churches everywhere, said Mr. Adams.
Today, none.
He said that he understood the origin of the wines.
People are winning in different ways now, he said.
Bar is no longer a neighborhood.
For the church members, it is a concern that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders thought, but sooner or later they will return to where they started.

A lot of people and buying apartments in these houses will be white, he said, so they will speed up the day of the church closing completely because it will be hard for most people to get into these houses and become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black City in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The first Methodist congregation left in 1930.
The name of the building was taken from the six black congregations that worshiped nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a blockade of the merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who prevented the taking or supporting of blacks in the marketplace.

Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor to St. Martin, fondly called the bell the "bell of the poor".
Traditional treasures andhistorical resources cannot be replaced

Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
The news at St. Martin over the past few months has been a mix of gossip and fabrications, some by the church leadership, others by the church's subdivision under the Bishops.
The Training House - a church management group, filled with leaders - wrote to the church department in July for suggestion that the church department  would like to transfer the bills to the barn, even though the barn was not involved in hiring the plumbers and builders the church department sent.

The 13-year-old was injured by a shark in a California lobster raid
Shark fell and injured the 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was forced into the water for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The quake occurred before 7 am along the Beacon River in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends were forced into the water around half past five Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he and some others crossed the boat to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was a novelty to hold a lobster, but then he found out it was a lobster, and he said, "I'm done!"
I'm a mess!'
Hammel, who had all his bones torn off, said he noticed as soon as he got to the boy.
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water:There's a shark in the water!Hammel added.

The shark that made the nest is unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles told the editor that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but decided it wasn't a bad shark.
Giles added that the victim had extensive injuries to his upper body.

Giles also said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not seen as aggressive.

Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that small stores will continue to be like supermarkets as department stores try to replace the discounted Aldi and Lidl by adding more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been installing the Argos mini-store in several stores, and has been importing a significant number of Habitats since it bought the two companies two years ago, which it says has increased food sales and increased the purchase's profitability.
Try to re-start the drug market failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture between Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over how profits from the pharmacy stores would be split into its larger customer base.
The new standard comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would work on the plan, by adding shares of the famous and attractive skincare stores such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
We have changed the look and feel that has been the norm for our jewellery to create a more environment for our customers.
We also spend money on specialists who are immediately available to advise.

We angry with Peter Jones as Holly Willoughby backs out of £11million deal

Willoughby has no time for the clothing and homewares store Truly.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This Morning, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has let Dragons Den's Peter Jones down by stepping down from their successful live act last season - to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortune to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
Truly is truly the best in Holly's needs.
It should be her future in hand that will take care of her for the next decade.


Marlow Headquarters has a warehouse of stuffed goods that are ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's promoter, who is one of Britain's most famous and profitable, could cost the store millions of dollars due to the huge budget on products ranging from chairs and candles to furniture and homewear, and the possibility for further executions in its early days.
It may be the end of the long haul.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, a mother of three, were friends with Jones and Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016, Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The couple collects pension funds together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV advertising company.
Willoughby will be the corporate vice president of M&S, and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.

Trump followed the idea of true faith in his closing remarks.

Tena taimbanga nkhondo ndi North Korea.




It's very easy to make a president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing around trying to get into a crowded place, we have about 200 people standing here,Trump said, with the demographics in front of him.

Cromwell's design of parliament has become the latest monument to the Rewrite history controversy.


It is inevitable that the current debate over the removal of Oliver Cromwell's skeleton and skull outside the Palace of Westminster will be the focus.
The desecration of religious symbols during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Cromwell was probably wrongly executed for the wrongdoing of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrayal of Cromwell meant a spark in 19th-century thought and a piece of narrative for a man many people believed should be celebrated.
Cromwell is often praised, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the parliamentary protector of external influences, in his political speeches.

October may see some strong temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will be warmer.
Sometimes this results in a big change in the demand in a short time.
There is a huge pattern of dramatic temperature differences across the U.S. and on Saturday.
There are about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Through the next few days, the summer heat will continue to try to dry up and get hotter again.

Brett Kavanaugh's speech was watched by over 20 million people

Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had drunkenly beaten him and tried to rob him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a very influential statement, said he was 100% sure he didn't.

The station also counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.

Nielsen, on the other hand, has a problem with the audience.
To make sense of that, that's the size of the specimens that resemble those at the winner's football stadium or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose thoughtful editors have endorsed Kavanaugh's nomination, topped all networks by having an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day attendance, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC has 2.89 million subscribers and CNN has 2.52 million subscribers, Nielsen said.
The interest increased after the ban.
Flake is a big fan of Friday's theme.

Flake said that his company had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the conference.


Flake was slightly altered in his conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.

Flake's choice was valid, because it meant that Republicans didn't have a vote to support Kavanaugh and didn't do the poll.

Livingston, on the other hand, extended their win streak with no response in the division to six games, while head coach Holt has not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost their opportunity to the unintelligent and the outsider
The Holt should have been ahead before they scored, their hard play brought all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed but lost his shot before the goal, then Alan Lithgow had more difficulty in his shot as he finished to get the head ball that Craig Halkett had passed before the goal.

"I am a man who loves the game", he said.
Rangers gave a free kick, Livingston opened the hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to release Menga, who touched him once and came out of the middle of the box to score.

The series continued until the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to play his role.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked Scott Pittman, Lithgow missed the ball which Livingston again threw in a spot.
The ball came back and forth in Livingston's box, which was all lost, with two penalties being denied - one for touching the ball, and one for Halkett's footing of Glenn Middleton.

National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for parts of western Arizona to the southern and eastern Nevada, eastern and southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix right on Tuesday, with a rain check and arriving on Monday evening.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has tweeted that only 10 severe thunderstorms have persisted in the tropical storm or hurricane storm winds within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ coastline.
The latest National Wind Rate Standard predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated concentrations reaching 6 inches at the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western and Southern Deserts including the central Rockies and the Great Basin can get 1 to 2 inches, isolated concentrations up to 4 inches and are available.

Indonesia: Tetemokerta, tsunami, dan ratusan korban jiwa, dan jumlah korban masih meningkat


The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat started yesterday, people were doing their activities along the river, they didn't run immediately, so it affected them, Sutopo Purwo Nugrogo, spokesperson for Indonesia's national disaster management agency BNPS said in a press conference in Jakarta.
Tsunami tidak datang, merobohkan mobil, pohon, rumah, dan memukul segala sesuatu di tanah, kata Nugroho, dan dikatakan tsunami itu melintasi sungai dengan kecepatan 800 kph (497 mph) sebelum mencapai tepi sungai.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were transported to 24 stations in Palu.
The blasts from the disaster site showed most of the houses and shops damaged, bridges rising and falling and mosques rounded.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Indonesia's Bureau for Research and Technology Transfer (BPPT) said the magnitude and intensity of the Friday quake was about 200 times the intensity of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.

Nugroho described the damage as extensive and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.

Nugroho said the deaths and damage could extend along the coastline 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which lies near the epicenter of the earthquake.

The Red Cross said in a statement that there are more than 300,000 people living there, and that its staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
It's been an accident, but it could get worse, he said.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The U.S. should be paying the A.I. twice

The hype came as many parts of the U.S. government made a statement about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no known AI plan.
China, on the other hand, launched its strategy last year: it aims to be the #1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Dubling AI research funding would be a good start, I'm sure all other countries have reached where the U.S. is, but we're looking for the next big surprise in AI, Lee said.

AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China's most prominent AI company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI system that won the prestigious Othello Prize in America, later becoming the vice president at Microsoft Research and the head of Google's China division.
Lee believes in the U.S. government's technology competition such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys Robotics Challenge and asks when the next one will be, to help identify the next new contestants.

It's not China that's taking over the education authorities; it's the corporations, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring experts from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. support its AI efforts.
I think people with PhD in AI should be given green cards automatically he said.
China's State Council issued the Next Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
National Natural Science Foundation of China provides people in higher education with the same funding as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education services in China is low, Lee said.

This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a new project called AI Next.
For NSF, it now spends over $100 million per year on AI research.

Macedonians vote on a name change
Macedonia is to be renamed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a longstanding dispute between Greece who have blocked its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, and insists on the name of its mountainous neighbor and expresses claims to its territory, has blocked its entry into NATO as well as the EU.


Supporting NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement between Greece.

I came today to lay my hands on the future of our country, for the youth in Macedonia to be able to live their lives as they want under the protection of the European Union because it means a better life for us all by Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.

The name change would require two-thirds majority in the legislature.


I can't vote for my children, our situation is in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, elected mayor, Skopje.
PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the nomination in Macedonia for the name change of the country which will open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.

We stand with NATO and EU, but we want to get in by the mountain, not by the working route said Kavadarkov.
Naomi ni shinji te, kono te ni shinjite
"If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look for others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian mix".

I believe many people will like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want EU and NATO Zaev said after completing his paper.
He said that the result ee will be certain of our future


70% of them said yes.

38-17 Melrose: Ayr and never saw the fall
Two tests and a late start have only slightly damaged the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr should win in today's exciting Tennents Premiership.


We have tried across our games so far, we have not won, so we are very happy, he said.
Ayrs, they took more time than we did.

Climo then extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, once at half-time, he scored and completed the only try to make it 17-5 for Ayr in the second half.

There was a big time loss for Ruaridh Knott, who was injured, and in the opening round, Ayr went on to score a try at Stafford McDowall, which Climo eventually completed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The home side returned, and even though Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climo out of the penalty line, MacPherson was lying behind Ayr and facing a problem.
Climo shot him, as he did a little later in the round, as Kyle Rowe grabbed a shot in David Armstrong's box and sent out a second-half Gregor Henry for the team's fifth home try.

Recuperate is a task.


Bolivia is now encouraged, with a spirit of unity and calm, and with a positive outlook in anticipation of the outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, the ambassador of Bolivia.

Evo Morales, the fascinating Bolivian president - who is facing a tough fight for reelection next year - also has a lot to rely on for Monday's decision.
We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean he vowed last August.


The decision of the ICJ coming only six months after the last hearings shows that the case is not a surprise, said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in foreign law.

The issue of mining the river is one that the current Bolivian administration has taken over by force, Zárate said.
Morales's words are a joke to the anger that has become so familiar to every Chilean, he compares.

The two cities have not exchanged a representative since 1962.

Boliviahas a unique opportunity to open a new era in Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was using the water issue as political endorsement.
Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Thus, we have to overcome the past.

The orange raffia bag, decorated with thin raffia and fitted with a clean leather, is a unique feature of Jacquemus La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Week.
I look forward to seeing the big hats and beachside bags reach highway for next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the indigenous
The Scottish Independent Schools set the record for the most academic achievement, and this was continued in 2018 with the most impressive test results, which were measured by individual and team achievements in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With a growing population of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to delivering the highest standard of service for their students and their parents.

As the education sector can adapt and implement the curriculum of the higher schools, we see new languages being developed that are bringing together the topic of choice required in schools.

Data, collected from 74 participating schools in SCIS, showed that 72% of students achieved A High in Mandarin, while 72% of those who read German, 69% of those who read French and 63% of those who read Spanish achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people to develop in the future.

Some schools will focus more on new languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as most important for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.

Scotland's Independent Schools are committed to creating a learning environment that will equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future brings.

The power of movement is a fully realized game strategy but is believed by the players, which is often misunderstood in this type of puzzle.

They went with six points and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little encouragement, I think, said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.

The Americans, as Spieth said, felt they had little air on their shoulders and had a lot of motivation, and not the least of which was the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played games together all day, and each would boast three out of four points.
Spieth was injured from a hit on the tee to the hip and was walking like a dog.

The kind of scream he met in the push that gave them a win at 15, the kind that tells you he believes the Americans are not out of this.
You have to look inside and miss for your own game, said Spieth.
"I'm a big fan of the game.

Moliwood is the only link not lost on Saturday afternoon, but they have scheduled the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning nine-hole finals.
The beat, and the energy coming and going from the noisy crowd proved to be the players to beat on Sunday, which would have no other famous player who could lead to a European victory as the sun sets at Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It's best to do both at the same time in different slots.

Europe 10-6 to advance to the Ryder Cup final
Europe will be looking to make a big move on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 loss to the United States in the two-man and four-man Saturday.
The two inspired by their spirit, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over Tiger Woods in a try, to take the Le Golf National by four points.

The US fought hard in the four-man event, winning in two sets, but they couldn't reduce the number of wins.
Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 shots by one man on Sunday to hold their trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European to win four consecutive times with Molinari, named Molliwood after a special weekend as the pair won four of their first four matches in the historic Ryder Cup.

Woods, who hung himself in two shots on Saturday, showed his skill in the shot put but has thrown 19 of 29 shots in the one-two balls and four-man in the seventh innings repeatedly.

They won a hard 2&1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the two-man ball and came back to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in the four-man round, having lost in the opening two rounds.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to lose in a one-man playoff, though as cup holders, a Furyk team only needs to score one go, who go to keep their trophy.
After two days of fighting, the Sunday attack seemed to have outnumbered them.
North Korea says it will not land weapons without receiving approval
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing restrictions are creating a lack of trust in the United States and that there is no way that their country would ever abandon their nuclear weapons in such a situation.

Tota, we didn't see his next comment from the U,S he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in this situation, there is no way we can first lay down our weapons.


North Korea seeks an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disarm its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for easing the tough international embargo on North Korea.
U.S. stuck to the nuclear-proofing and increased its recommendations through the prohibition to achieve their goals in a convincing way, and further questioned the declaration of the end of war Ri said.
Understanding and banning us is a dream of those who don't know us.
Problem is that progress is not enough to keep us from losing confidence.

This year at the United Nations, Trump who last year declared "total destruction" to North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to follow the disarmament process, but said there was still so much work to be done that the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea ceased its nuclear weapons.

China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should give Pyongyang credit for their actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that The Security Council's enforcement of sanctions will continue unabated until we achieve complete, ultimate nuclear disarmament.

Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the U.N. General Assembly and later told him that he would come to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.



Harvard students studying to get a full vacationHarvard students studying to get a full vacation


Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, organized the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the study after giving a lecture on the consequences of not sleeping while studying.
After that a young girl came to me and said:Why is this being told to me now, in my old age?
She told The Telegraph.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and the university's president of health services, said the university decided to launch the study after it was discovered that students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The course lasted an hour and included a series of workshops.

The school map has dialogic symbols, thus helping participants to think about their daily activities.
We know he won't change the student attitude immediately.
We believe they have the ability to know- just like you have the ability to know the health consequences of smoking choices, Professor Czeisler added.

Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the study, having taught his class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and stimulated his thoughts to push this learning for all schools.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Professor Czeisler advises students to think about wearing a watch for when they want to go to sleep, and when they want to wake up, and also be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screen light from the sky and LED light, which can disrupt your body's behavior, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal scored against Gerrard's
Rangers suffered a painful injury as Dolly Menga's shot to the side of Steven Gerrard shattered in their 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win on the road since their 4-1 defeat in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager with eight points clear of the Ladbrokes Premiership top-flight side, Hearts.
Menga scored before the seventh minute of the half, and the Rangers without a stimulus didn't seem to be able to score.
Rangers were relegated to the sixth tier, Linvingston moved up to the third tier and finished only behind Hibernian on goal difference.

Gerrard made eight changes on the side that went past Ayr to the next round of the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, meanwhile, went with a 11 Livi, which robbed the Hearts of a point last week, and he would have liked his strong team to have followed their opponents everywhere.
Rangers may have been the best catchers but Livingston was the best with the ball they had and made a difference.
They should have scored in the second minute after Menga's first small kick sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGrego's goal, but the midfielder missed his big break.
Keaghan Jacobs' shot met goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his team-mate goalkeeper Alan Lithgow was only able to throw it behind.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than there was confidence as they drove to the third round.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty in the 15th minute after a draw with Steven Lawless but manager Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers only managed to get on the post twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly suffered no injuries and Lassana Coulibaly hit him in the head with a shot from Ovie Ejaria.

The Rangers also couldn't touch Jacob's deep throat.
Scott Arfield was unimpressed with Declan Gallagher's delivery to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for his dismissal.
Gerrard rebounded in the break as he used Ryan Kent to replace Coulibaly who made an immediate impact, as the flanker shot Morelos but Kelly's good run ran away from where he was coming to block.
Livingston continued to keep the guests in their favourite sport, while Lithgow and Halkett played goalball regularly.
The Holt side managed to extend their win in the final but McGregor eventually gave up and rejected Jacobs, before Lithgow took the lead and kicked the ball to the side.
Rangers defender Glenn Middleton complained of a late penalty in the match against Jacobs but Thomson again ignored the penalty.
Almanak: The Geiger Scale
Today is a page from the AlmanakOur Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Read ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhem Hans was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring the amount of radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Scale.
The Geiger Horse was the basis for a new breed, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado". Its characters are not as good as the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:

HER2 inhibits the growth of many viral infections, including viral infections of the breast, ovaries, breast and duct, explained Dr. Berzofsky.

Kanye West Went on Angry Talk Tour with Trump, Dressed in MAGA Hats, After He Appeared on SNL.
A No Go
Kanye West was shouted at the club during Saturday Night Live after he finished his stunning performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and declared that he would run for president in 2020.

Many times I've had a conversation with a white person, and they say:How can you like Trump, who hates black people?
Entertained, if black-hatred had affected me, I'd have left America long ago. he said.
SNL opened the show with a bit of humor featuring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star blasted Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Congressional Judiciary Committee for the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.

It is unclear whether Rock intended to bully the West by spreading the message.
West furthermore confessed to the viewers that he was disappointed in the backyard about his hat.
They spoke badly of me in the back of the house.
"Usava koala, na uondoka huko".
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
She said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Do you want to see the mystery? says he's going to wear his superman suit, which means you can't tell me what to do.
J'aime beaucoup.

West was last seen as the replacement for Ariana Grande, who was the girlfriend of ex-rapper Mac Miller who died a few days ago.
West has put a lot of people in a dilemma by wearing a dress like Kalama Perrier used to play the song I Love it.


But I choose NOT to give a tip (by buying his music or clothes or sponsoring his art) to someone who I believe is sharing and expressing a harmful belief in society.

He added: "We are not alone.

The message appeared online on Thursday, posted anonymously on Capitol Hill during the Senate debate on the sex allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came after three lawmakers questioned Kavanaugh.
The standard security sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate reported that the IP address used to identify where the message was broadcast was associated with the Waters company, and released information that was reported by Waters employee, Hill.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and completely hateful,Waters continued.
My employee who has violated his identity, personal information and security due to these fraudulent and false allegations - has no involvement in the dissemination of the information.

Waters' statement prompted an immediate online outcry, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.

It came as Fleischer was criticizing Waters's actions and the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to depose Waters during the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
Great if true he wrote.
Waters said in his statement that his company has already called  the relevant authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.
We will see that those who did it will come out, he continuedand that the law will catch them for all their harmful and terrible actions towards the man and all my servants.
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Secret Comedy by Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to seek the Brexit need in any new British-themed film, and this is as relevant as the Johnny English comedy-drama series - which began with Johnny English in 2003, and returned in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Johnny English, a fool with a big, plastic face, has reworked his ability to promote a second act - his name more than anything indicates that it is a comedy invention designed for non-English speaking parts of the country.
He is indeed a piece of undercover work that is nevertheless imitated intricately, with little Clouseau, little Mr Bean and the shadow of the man putting on a voice-over theme for Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It relies on the traveller and international secret agent Atkinson who made a forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a mess behind.
There are one or two good moments in this new JE.
I love Johnny English coming up to the plane with his old uniform, his old helmet with a mop.
Atkinson's gift for visual comedy was outstanding, but the comedy was not strong and over the top, especially since the films no funny like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now also have a sense of humor in them.
The comedy seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me the Johnny English tour has no special plot and its purpose is as a silent film of Atkinson, the Bean character.
The main focus now is that Great Britain is in a crisis.
A rogue hacker hacks into Britain's most secretive intelligence network, exposes all the intelligence agents at work, and confuses the intelligence agent at work - a minor event for Kelvin Eldon.
It was the last for a president who was arrogant and troubled, with no political support at all: Emma Thompson tried her best to make this event more like Teresa-May but still had nothing on the books to work with.

That means Johnny English is opening up the mess himself, who is hired as a teacher in a rich school, but gives lessons that aren't in school how to be a secret agent: literally writing here, as English gave the secret school style School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for giving advice and was joined by his second suicide bomber, Ben Miller.
Bough was married, and was associated with the naval gunnery, a program run by the late Vicki Pepperdine to get drunk.
So with the ever-destroying Batman and Robin Her Majesty's Secret Service is back, meeting Olga Kurylenko as the good-looking Ophelia Bulletova.

English and Bough embark on a journey of their own ridiculous fun: turn into a cook, set fire to a French restaurant; cause a riot by getting themselves on the Volta cruise ship; English stirs up a frenzy as he tries to use Virtual Reality to explore Volta's interior.

It's not over the top.
like in other Johnny English movies, it didn't bother me to wonder: couldn't British actors give Rowan Atkinson a program that would bring out his talent well?
Labour denies planning for British to work four days a week and receive five-day pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a reform that will see British people working four days a week and getting paid for five days.

The new law will allow workers to work three days a week and receive the same salary.
The speakers said that this concept  would fit with the objectives and economic strategy of the association to make it more workable.

It is expected to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
It won't happen immediately but working four days a week is the aim of the union in line with the economic adjustment system to fit the workers and the productivity aggregate of the union.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election cycle.

Labour Party spokesperson said:Four day work week is not a proposal of the party so the party does not consider it
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to lay out his vision for change and the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he decided to take back control from the Leaders of unknown companies and the major beneficiaries in the lifestyle industries.
The shadow chancellor scheme also means that water industry shareholders may not get their full capital, for the Labour government may  make deductions on the basis of wrong motives.

60 minutes and the FBI investigation may change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about the agency's findings on whether Republican lawmakers can change their minds and withdraw their support.
60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could release anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I think, yes, said Kennedy.
I was told that when I joined the debate, I was told, I was told to speak to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him later, when the accusation came out, and said, You did it?
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
Graham's vote, anyway, as written.
I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, that he will take a strong charge, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know why but I know this: Brett denies so much, Graham added, cheering for Christine Blasey Ford.
Available for all the time.

US may use Navy for lockdown to prevent Russian energy transfers- State Secretary
Washington may or may not use its Navy to block Russia's ability to enter markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has confirmed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has accused Russia's involvement in Syria - famously, where it is operating due to a coup d'état by the legitimate government - is a fraudulent way to investigate new energy markets.
I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to trade energy as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday pointed to the paid addition of China Daily to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling local newspaper - after he accused China of trying to meddle in the U.S. legislative elections on November 6, an accusation that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election reflects what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new round of Washington's increasing backlash against China.

China's tax hikes at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters such as Iowa backing Trump's Republican campaign, said Chinese and U.S. officials.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China has hurt the American workers, farmers and businesses.

By spreading this hate, the Chinese government is taking the American cultural space that is dear to democracy and media freedom and putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register. by Branstad.
But looking at the media outlets on the streets of Beijing here, to see that there are so few different voices that you can't see anything really shows the different views that the Chinese may have about China's economic system in crisis, since it is the media outlets under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
One of the most prominent newspapers in China has planned to publish his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans Screwing Women Voters Before Midterm Election for Kavanaugh Conflict, Analysts Have Attention

The reaction was so great, that many Republicans have just registered their desire to continue the vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, spoke to The Hill about the article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning the final step made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be enough to calm voter anger.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget all tomorrow but November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and community spokesperson for MoveOn's progressive movement said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
November is coming! was chanted by protesters on Friday morning as they marched along the entire length of the House of Representatives where Republicans voted in the Supreme Court to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's declaration, Mic said.
Democrats' enthusiasm and inspiration will stand out, Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst he has never met, told reporters.
Worst: People say it's gone up; that's true.


This has been a disaster for the GOP, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
Not only for the congressional elections or the last election or whether Kavanaugh was elected, but also for how the Republicans handled this and how they handled it, Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, a Democratic nomination group, pointed to reporters.




Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had intoxicated her when she was 17.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his power when they held a banquet during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.

Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will chase Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source software Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid provides users with the freedom to choose where to store their data and also the information that people can access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind creating Inrupt was to govern the world.
We'll do it now he said about the new house.
It's time to go on the news.
The application uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create  personal online database or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a list of events, a calendar, a playlist and personal and professional applications.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on the same browser and all at the same time.

Privacy by data
Inrupt's vision, based on CEO John Bruce, is to bring together the right companies, infrastructure, processes and expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company owned only Berners-Lee, Bruce, the memory from which IBM purchased, the designers hired to work on the project and the assembly of the code that was self-published.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Berners-Lee said his team was not consulting Facebook and Google about whether to start or leave the startup completely changed as business models are turning instantly in a blink of an eye.
We don't get their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in a publication on Medium on Saturday that Inrupt's goal is to provide a business enabling environment to help maintain the trust and quality of the previously newly developed Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm very optimistic about the future that's already been, Berners-Lee added.

MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 full, only to be denied a party.
Letters from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and showing it happening all night on Uk on Channel 5.

Some people don't like being up all night, especially for the fight.

It was a government policy that by 6am the show was not suitable for children, so they got into the children's programming, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and advertising for Bellator, said when asked about the show.
Peppa the Pig, yeah.

I think when I think about his moves, I think we can probably fix it", said Coker.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we can't fix it until our Sunday, their Monday.
"Actually, we're working on it.
Trust me, when he changed the site, there was so much text back and forth that it wasn't all friendly.

The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has been a rising LGBT activist, and with her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia she has called for many other countries to abolish homosexuality.
She said that she made the speech because she felt lucky to be able to live an open life without any consequences and wanted to give others hope.
Love is a man
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, last year but said their age difference never made a difference.

Mickelson was left out of the Ryder Cup squad on Saturday
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Captain Jim Furyk replaced Mickelson, playing in the once-in-a-lifetime event for his 12th year, on Saturdays for the two-man and four-man rounds.
Entirement, comme il l'a toujours été pour les Américains, le champion à cinq reprises a passé sa journée à battre et à améliorer son jeu sur le terrain dans l'espoir de guérir de son handicap.
He was never a consistent hitter even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old did not fit the profile Le Golf National wanted, as the tall, beating-up star did not suffer long.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Furyk expressed confidence in his own person, not that he had anything else to say.
She chose her job today carefully, she slapped me on the back and she said, it will be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
She has a lot of confidence in herself.
He's a Hall of Fame member, and he's added a lot to the team last week and this week.
"I guess I didn't expect him to miss two games.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She wants to be in front of that, like everybody else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career which is less than the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk said his presence has led to an inexplicable setback for the team.
He is funny, he is funny, he likes to make people laugh, he is a good person to have in the club room he explained.
I think the young players were excited to play him this week, it was a thrill to see.
A lot of fun.
Skipper Thomas Bjorn of Europe knew that the big lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that to go into the singles round on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a big score can turn out to be a very unpleasant ride.
The Danes first appeared in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the Captain's side of the Seven Ballesteros scored five points over the Americans but were only able to cross the finish line with their nose in front by a small gap, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
We're going to try to remember ourselves in going with a big score at Valderrama; we're going with a big score at Brookline, where we lost, at Valderrama where we won but it's a little bit, said Bjorn, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, going 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, hysteria would show me that everyone is still in this.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
"Tsoga, u tshabe!
This is not over until you get the mark on the board.
"We had a goal, to try and win this trophy, and that's where our eyes were on.

Furyk himself has been at the end of the big day of the campaign, after he led the side to victory in Brookline before being defeated as Europe performed the Miracle at Medinah.
I remember all his speeches, he replied when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw gathered his team in the final day.

Germany again moved new weapons

Rheinland-Pfalz,the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but initial problems followed the planned scope.
Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate Four launched by the Navy in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class frigate.
It is understood that they will have a very powerful gun head, various air and naval missiles as well as some secret technologies, such as radar, infrared and sound compatibility.
Other important projects included a long repair period - it should be possible to put the new frigates into service up to two years away from the port.

The F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the Navy and the crew had just returned.

The lack of software is critical since 120 pilots will be piloting the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class - only half the people piloting the older Bremen class frigates.

Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have carried twice as much cargo as the same class of ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.

                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The difficulty in capturing the new frigates was particularly significant due to the early warning that the German Navy was losing strength.


He concluded that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the Navy.
National Trust pays attention à la vie secrète des cigognes
A new study in a Scottish Highlands reserve seeks to reveal how a cockroach uses a sting to cook.
It is hoped that the findings will further inform the understanding and behaviour of these unique mammals and help to shape future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow the famous pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared in Daubenton and Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.


An acoustic analysis of all recordings will show how often the call is made and what each species is doing.

Rob Dewar, global conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that these results will show the most important aspects of the habitat and how each species is using it.


They are threatened by construction and development that affect shelter and shelter.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as well as flypaper and some chemical safety devices used in construction, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The sparrow is certainly not a fool.

They use sound detection to find the pitfalls and bottlenecks in their worship.
NTS, who are responsible for the maintenance of over 270 old houses, 38 important fields and 76,000 hectares of land in the suburbs, called the task force "very important".

The company has set up a special site in Scotland for the first bat in the Threave reserve in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species live.
David Thompson, un's manager, said: "This is the best place for them.
Here in Threaves, we have a beautiful spot for crows, he said.
We had an old house, old trees and all nice apartments.


Two of the three were killed, tortured, or otherwise harmed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called for public support to get involved.
"Today, we have a lot to learn about our own species and the many, many species of bats that we don't know how many live".
Ronaldo rejects rape as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegation fake news, saying that people want to promote themselves by using his name.

Ronaldo, 33, in the wake of the allegation, called the story a "fake news".
Nyam, nam, nam, nam, nam.
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It used to be.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of this work.
I'm a happy and good person, added the player, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegation, which they call an unacceptable story for an investigation into his private life, according to Reuters.
The player will receive a punitive damages for  breach of the rules in proportion to the amount of damage, is probably one of the biggest violations of privacy in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 inside the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

The paper claims that Ronaldo believes they had a sexual relationship but everyone else believes.

The 34-year-old girl said that she wanted to overturn the verdict as she was still suffering from the accusation.
Ronaldo was looking to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crash, and this summer, he moved to the Italian giant, Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be sad for the future if the carmakers are left behind
UK would be sorry for the future if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
It is also missing that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need an agreement, said Mr Clark.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory said Marvin Cooke general manager of Toyota and Burnaston.

BMW, for its part, has announced that it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

It is unlikely that Toyota will leave more than a day's supply at their factory in Derbyshire, the company said, as production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is designed to avoid all checks on the ground.
We want to have a deal.We want to have the best deal that will give us the opportunity as I say, which is not just to get the momentum right now but to also take this opportunity, he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
Suffice from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that a fully successful marketing strategy should be continued.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the meantime, they are warning that the price increase will reduce the power of its pumps and eventually will be dismantled.

We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The White House says Trump's Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again
The crucial meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein may be postponed  next week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is responsible for special operations Robert Mueller who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia and the blocking of the president's impeachment proceedings.


Rosenstein was right to deny this story.


Trump said he would not like to fire Rosentein but then cut short the meeting to avoid crowding out the congressional caucus of Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of corruption, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.

Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I always like to keep the media informed about what's happening right away.
Sanders has not been the White House's editor since September 10.
The supervisor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of editorial was due to the disdain for high-profile investigative reporting by TV reporters, although he said:I don't really believe they are looking for high-profile investigative reporting.

The president has more interview time than any president before him, he said, adding that he did not mention any evidence:We have looked at these numbers.

We're trying to do that a lot, you've seen us do that a few weeks ago, and that's going to replace the news editor when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in interviews or press conferences when there are foreign officials.
The press is not a rare sight.
In New York this week the president probably explained why, that making appearances is bad, sometimes bad appearances in front of the press.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff and NHS Scotland about the Brexit risk

The Treasury expects to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless

It would be seen as an attempt to undermine the progress of Jeremy Corbyn's push to attract voters and young people with promises of more cheap housing and the expulsion of those with higher salaries.

Mojayako je dominating Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his biggest ambition is to be Scotland's leader once and for all.
The Scot, 42, is thrilled for the fight to bring back the North-East league, who are currently in the third tier of League One, three points below the top.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer to lead St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"Ndatamba ku timu ya ka.
Ross told Sportsound of BBC Scotland. I got a cap B that's it.
But I grew up in Scotland and Hampden a lot, and I was with my dad when I was a kid, and it was always something that I was attracted to.
The opportunity will come, though, if I do well in team management.
The team's most successful period was in the 1970s, when they won the FA Cup.

Currently my progress is going to be measured byCan I take this team back to the Premier League?
Due to the platform and the building of this club, that without a doubt should be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get back there, but I can only see myself as a good fit here if I can lead the team back there.
Ross spent just three years in his managerial role, after a short spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay on the Hearts staff.
He went on to help Alloa bounce back from relegation to the third tier, and turn St Mirren from relegation to winning the Championship Cup the following season.

It could be a good deal, he thought, to take over Alloa.
I really believe that management is better for me, than running.
It sounded bad because I did well, lived a good life, and had some vision of heavenly good.
"Available" is a very difficult word.
You have a lot to go through each week.

A great fear realized for mother as well as child.
Why not use them to spread the breastfeeding message for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?

This is a new ad aimed at moms who are doing the rescue (sometimes at work or in their bathroom) and find themselves asleep.
This is not an advertisement and praises or condemns the dairy industry.

The perception that backed the ad was based on the understanding that the majority of women on breastfeeding said they saw themselves as cows.

It was not unusual in 17th Pennsylvania and the money supply, thanks to the reform of the congressional camp that two politicians were running for the same seat.

Lamb was crushed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is largely confined to the new 17th district.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old park was divided in a way that was unconstitutional to favor the Republicans.
The campaign on the 17th has just begun a campaign fundraiser between the two major political sponsors, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a minor victory in the March special election that was overwhelmingly watched for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republican has held the seat for ten years, and President Donald Trump won the seat by 20 votes.

The U.S. Waits to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, and Stops
The ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had backed Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team was fired by the partners.
The State Department decided to withdraw the American diplomats from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the recent decision to end support for Taiwan, Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, said in a statement earlier this month.




The delegates said that Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to meet the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in recognition of the importance the administration places on the meetings.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new force messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate as described by the three American officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the House debate in a confidential manner.

Rangers and Rapid Vienna on Thursday, know that a win over the Austrians, followed by a dreaded knockout in Spain between Villareal earlier this month, will put them in a tough position to complete the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villareal but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to make serious moves.
It's a good score for us because Villareal is a good side, said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game bet we could get something and with one score come out.
Maybe we should get a win in the end but, in summary, whoever wins is also a good result.
They seemed better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were better in the first half.

New York magistrates are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorism in New York that killed eight people - the most severe and unprecedented punishment in the state for any federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with the Home Depot truck robbery and the bicycle accident along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.

Both charges could carry the death penalty, by court order.

The attack required organization and serious deliberation, the judges said, and explained the behaviour that Saipov used to make him authorized, abusive and abusive.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, torture, and destruction to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York handled a death penalty case.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York city trial was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit treason against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no humanity in the days and months following the attack, which was shown by court documents.
He told the investigators that he was fine, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, which the indictment showed.


David Patton, one of the city's public advocates and representative of Saipov, said they are deeply sorry for the decision of the court.
We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole will only increase the fear of the programs for all concerned, Patton said.

Bottas got off to a good start, barely leaving Hamilton on the sand as he defended his position in the first two laps and called Vettel to hug his teammate.
Vettel got into the pit first and let Hamilton get into the lockdown at the end of the group, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after suffering a leg-to-leg injury so that the Ferrari driver reluctantly gave up the open due to fear of straining after a push-up to make a move in the third period.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid, and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.

He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace with eight laps remaining as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all week and was a very gentle man as I was told.
Hamilton said that the same team has done a special job to have the first and the second.

Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not immediately address the evidence Ford presented before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were cruel and corrupt.

Micronesia: Air Niugini sabotage after a submarine crash

Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, that it had not been able to find a single male passenger.







Some witnesses thought that the plane crossed the road.

That's a great good thing, said Jaynes.
Jaynes u said that he and others tried to cross the water on foot and reached the emergency exit of the plane with a chuckle.
He said that the flight crew were scared and screaming, and that he had a small wound in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that crew and pilots nearby were working to improve the harbor and helped with rescue operations by using a balloon boat and getting people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed 111 people killed in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades but could not include Air Niugini.

U.S. Department of Justice Investigator Paul Rowlett testified for a long time as an expert witness in the field of intelligence testing.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were with her on the evening of her death, contrary to her last statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.

Sanford went to the bench on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the jury questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was thinking about Tuesday, because I was in Nashville.
Tellis, who was also a victim of the Holocaust, said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before his death.

Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and text messages from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hale said.

The couple denied that they were having an affair, saying that the case was money laundering.

Maurice and the couple are now seeking a $350 per day child support for the kidnapping, and the housing authority previously employed him, despite no written agreement.
I want to show them, look, you don't do the same thing", he told the Post on Friday, addingI know it's biased.
The couple have denied the accusations of being biased, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the right thing to do, and fearing that they could not trust him after they had offended him.

Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family", also said that his father was proud of his subsequent success.
He was a gentle man, not a proud one, he said.
But because Paddington lives so much for him, it's like having a little kid achieve something: you'll have a big heart for them even if it's not necessarily your own.
I think he saw Paddington's progress that way.
Paddington was always praised for his work.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
I think, if we can get something like what he's asking for - a limited, limited review - we can get a little bit of unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, putting his fears that the congregation andetisasi into a tight political lockdown.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of interest is due to the time.

George W. Bush and raise the phone to call the Congress, and ask them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases his complaint?

It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the lower house of the legislature, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to call his case and put it in the Supreme Court.




Pyongyang has not commented publicly.

Seoul said that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

China is finding the refugees as more refugees are breaking the law and angry about taking them back.




Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under those circumstances, there is no way we can be a one-time consensus on our disarmament, Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", she said she was not old enough to serve on the Supreme Court


I couldn't stop thinking if a woman did something like that, they would saycrazy Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.


Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony showed she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed her disfavor towards Democrats.
I think he defended himself by using those words and by the way he criticized the Clintons and the Democrats
Pelosi was quiet when asked if she would like to remove Kavanaugh if he were put in office, if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
I will say this - if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is he no longer fit to be on the Supreme Court, but you are on the court he is on now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is the chief judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.


Not time for a madman, who is rushing to go to court and expect us to say, That's not right, said Pelosi.
Female Use.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of anger and despair, he can't say it without crying.

Donald Trump, US President, warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese shipping markets including solar panel, steel and aluminum.
The biggest stimulus this week has been new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) in product prices, with tariffs being imposed on half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing has also recently imposed a 5 to 10 percent tax on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to unite the US in every way, the world's second largest economy cannot be expected to survive anytime soon.

Experts still insist that if Beijing plays its cards well, the US trade war could support China in a positive way in the future by reducing the imbalance between the two economies.
