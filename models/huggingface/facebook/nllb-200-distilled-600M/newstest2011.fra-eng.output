What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or a pastry shop in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital's city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new SDG colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, whether they know the argument that has been made in recent years at the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that ruled Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cremation put into place during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the city's personalities, situations, and causes.
Surprisingly, it was discovered that the newly elected did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I am a young man in Prague politics", said Lukas Kaucky, the cultural electorate's "godfather" vocabulary test.
And as for the veteran politician, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you're proposing I use"
Otherwise, I'm not using the argument.
From the vocabulary, the daily Aktualne.cz published the words in June this year before the ODS pre-election congress, the editorial board selected 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague city hall.
The socialists were to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the pastry shop", "beef nerve", "capital betrayal" and "sweeping".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who will lead education in Prague in the future - promised an interview first but then did not answer the phone.
The fifth candidate, Petr Dolinek, refused the test.
"I do not deal with these matters at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I will not give my opinion".
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programmes", he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend that he is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka Tunnel", Kaucky says, adding immediately, "but I know it from the papers".
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course", he joked.
Not only Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environment's elected official, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"It's about going into a business, I think", Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
Brezina also recalls that he learned from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test takers, there is no lexicon of arguments in social democracy.
"I've consulted with colleagues and it seems we really don't have anything like this guy".
"We call each other names when we use abbreviations and symbols", says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, which members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The Actuel.cz newspaper tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the Party members or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election through scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The only nicknames that the Social Democrats admit to use within the party are also nicknames.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Law in Matraca" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his JUDd. degree from the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", a brochure has published.
In Burkina Faso, women who are declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, unable to work for health reasons, free and childless.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very seldom has this destiny".
"Young women are also not considered healthy because they participate in work and give birth", says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a booklet that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", warned Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ghana, a 72-year-old woman, Ammy Hemma, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing ignited on the woman's touch.
The oil burned, it is said, when the team tried to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all educational levels.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger", he says.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunt, The Gambia did not see the President himself participate until last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide witch hunt which, it is reported, had participated in his death and had tried by black magic to kill the President as well".
"Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to the rescue brought randomly selected men and women from villages in The Gambia to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard", Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, the prisoners were required to drink an herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
The international pressure has released about a thousand people.
Bakal's tenant: The boilers are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man walked out the door of the Byty RPG company's customer centre to "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second-class apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heater runs on solid fuel", points out the man who has the signature power on his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway", he explains in a moved and half-resigned rage.
The citizens' association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published explaining the method to apply.
But the man responds to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region is becoming the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rent does not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it's already full on Tuesday at 9am.
Right next to the door is a security guard with a phone to call customers.
A special button, "2011 rent", is on the touch screen.
One press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" because your number is already starting to shine on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple comes to inquire about the rent, but the new rent doesn't seem to apply to the people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - claims for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people in more than 44,000 RPG apartment portfolio have been collecting mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rental increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special ticket office for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still in the testing stage", replies the employee behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deforestation and former miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The deputy speaker of parliament from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this quite consistently before the elections and it is now in the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the bathroom", relieves the man mentioned in the introduction.
However, according to the employees, it is mainly retired people who come to make sure they will receive a refund on the new rent price if they sign now as RPG promised in a special offer.
This is a refund of half the rent amount that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new lease before December 15.
But the "de-regulation" shop on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent", says the shopkeeper.
And yet RPG does put individual rent interviews on its website and in the showcases when necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will decide.
'This is not about threats but only about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' RPG says on its website.
"No one is going to court here", one of the employees at RPG Byty thinks, and the man in the street outside the customer center is right.
"I have 13,000 pensioners and I have 5,000 to eat, I don't have enough to go to court", he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see".
"Mr Zaoralek in the media is asking that no one sign and so people are waiting", she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"Moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund", recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the RPG Byty housing portfolio, who said that it was the neglect of the housing fund that angered the tenant that was the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rent 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the padded chairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre per month", says the screen.
The 38 percent increase is only for 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2", adds RPG.
Next year, the rent will stay the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over four to eight years.
It adds further commitments: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) is given to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rental agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices understood by the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one would have expected it to also house a mini preschool with everything it needed - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys, and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The architectural project firm Arch. Design, whose workshops produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has conceived its mini business nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and she cared that women architects and project managers could return to work quickly.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, the preschool is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social programme.
This gives builders and architects the opportunity to combine carefully designed work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design who conceived this nursery school themselves and with the support of management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-nursery school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme on human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
The funds (in the amount of CHK 2.8 million) allowed them to buy equipment and equipment and, after two years, to provide qualified staff and start-up.
After using the funding allocation (two years), the company Arch. Design. is obliged to operate the mini preschool on its own funds after 3 years.
The preparation of the project took a year and the Economy rating company helped to apply for the grant.
Childcare is provided by qualified staff, with a nurse and a kindergarten teacher taking care of children all day long.
Since this is a "mini-nursery school", there can be only 5 children present at a time, but during the day there are more who take their place.
The school is flexible in functioning according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is a matter of individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini preschool is comparable to that of preschool education.
Children not only play here but also get quality education - from beginners to school prep, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of being late to pick up the children at a school far from the parents' workplace.
So parents use their working time in the most productive way possible.
It is not surprising that a natural loyalty relationship develops between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and are family-friendly and through this programme strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo in Barcelona designed by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic shape, the house has been nicknamed the Bone House by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and curves everywhere, are all that are epic about Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
A more detailed observation shows the precise geometry, rhythm and order.
At night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of bright colors is enhanced.
The rolling and twisting of the shapes also appear in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the oily and the lamellae.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district on Passeig Street in Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The rebuilding took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy contractor, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building another entirely new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the building's owner and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and designers also worked on the facade.
The joint work for the plans for the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila house and the Guell Park which houses other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house after its completion "the Bone House" because of its organic shapes.
Others, considering the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that's bailing".
They say there's a sword like St. George's at the top of the building, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought of a unique system for the house in his central heating era, with typical air vents and fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems strange.
In the course of his creation Gaudi absolutely did not follow the building directives of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the start of construction he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the city council did not like the fact that the building columns were encircling the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo asked (and was satisfied) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-story house is divided by a staircase leading to an independent roof terrace.
All straight angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction was given a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles decorating the interior courtyard and with lighting wells.
The two-color game gives maximum lighting to every floor of the house.
All we had to do was bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo, which was inscribed in 2005 on the UNESCO World Heritage List, is a place that everyone can visit.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits as they found that this was a lucrative business and they extended the field of visits to the common areas and the attic including roof terraces.
The entrance fee for the monument is really low and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a companion among the building's inhabitants and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: Women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and the bed provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
The choice of the owner is determined by several factors: weight, height, age, health and sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the shrub will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a country house where you don't sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
They also weigh more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough air channels in their heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture.
Habit is also a determining factor in choice.
Those who spend light time abroad, where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it hard to feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
"So all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain they can't sleep there".
"For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misrepresents 'information' about joints and skin", explains Sylva Adamczikova, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago, the lazy foam mattress won over the hockey players and other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It either optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the body's heat.
Nothing pressures you, and you won't go back into the night like after a tough game.
You're just sleeping better.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against squid.
To choose a mattress that is your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman who are 180 cm tall need a 210/220 cm bed.
The minimum width for each two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single-seat beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient for a visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for bed width: when you lie on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent.
For a two-seater bed each person needs his own mattress and mattress, so be careful when buying to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, you will only have to climb the tree to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring mattresses at least 15 cm high, so that the form and airing layer is at least 3 cm high.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs", warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of woodcutter.
The bed, when the mattress and the bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are badly damaged; they don't need to be washed, which is common today.
And since at night we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that after 5 or 7 years, the mattress starts to recall a large (and clogged) snout.
For this reason, experts refuse to claim a 25-year lifetime for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all to his own devices.
For this, a suggestion from the sellers is to give a 120/140cm mattress a little less hygiene or washing, but instead a protective mattress that can be easily removed and washed.
And although it is common nowadays to make lining with a sliding closure for the whole set, that is, after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for the large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a struggle between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have a rigid board in your bed instead of a log?
I never did!
Maximum for a guest bed for one night.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use a spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with bag springs (German Taschenfederken) and an air-conditioning layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-positioned lamella trees with 14/18 lamella, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut) are ideal, but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamella, 28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to adjust the stiffness.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be used as they do not respond to changes in position.
Besides adjusting the stiffness of the lamellae, a so-called shoulder pad can also be installed.
It is a special bonding of the lamellae that allows the lamellae to be pressed or even tilted so that the sleeping shoulder "fits" well.
For men with "shoulders as wide as their backs", this is really important.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who have started using a softening area at the shoulder level for "masculine" use.
But they also think of women - they give them a softer surface in the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or platelet-shaped summers with what's called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and reduces the tension.
But be careful, of course, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and mattresses, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm which Scandinavians prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the shoulder height (with the summit shoulder pad or the area softened in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones made of straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also for organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials used to make polyurethane are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans precisely.
"The term 'Bio' for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products", explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants to make the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, coatings "cools" the man, and coatings "warm" the woman.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
What's your favorite?
Mattresses made from cold foam (they have more pores with a disturbed cell structure and are therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and have more elasticity).
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You'll pay for a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those characterised by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the top spot.
Saving for mattresses and the wood is not easy.
In the case of special promotions by manufacturers or producers, two mattresses may be available for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam, sews the coating for 1,1990 crowns.
Of course, we can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" pace.
It started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing huge loading factors.
The weather softened by the heat and hardened by the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the human body's heat and distributes the optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleep deprivation and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or similar.
The demand for people tracking devices is increasing among parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their children is making more and more people think about monitoring them using a GPS.
The system, which was initially set up to search for cars, can also be used to track people's movements and help in some cases, such as the one of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of lighters but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy", says Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil, one of the leading suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in a person's bag who is not aware of them, but I have not yet encountered such cases".
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons", adds Pilin.
He said children should always know what the "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if a child does not want to wear something like this, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don't want to be in control.'
"Mobile phones, which can cut off like tracking devices, have already brought parents to long-term expectations", says Bockova.
She said that the fact that this type of device could help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything in his power to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"It's the phone now".
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they will also go after them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help with unprepared child abuse.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
'The apparatus may be set to be in regular emission after a specified period.'
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains".
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and is in a straight-line position,' says Cech.
He said that so-called smart phones with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after being formatted with special prologue software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that they are either a device similar to those worn in a pendant the size of a lighting box or smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"It would be advantageous if the attacker could not recognize the tracking device".
"Or he will find out after a while, which will have given the police a little more time", he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 kilometers of ropes used for explosives.
As early as last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the rope is two to four years at most.
The army bought detonating warheads from the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave the reason for buying a huge amount of detonating rope from MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army fire engineers, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive drill every year.
The Minister of Defence, Alexandre Vondra, and the army commander, Vlastimil Picek, are no exception.
Just to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating rope.
That's 25,000 explosions that are within that distance.
And even if it were true, the Army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, as experts say, more than 2 m of detonating ropes are sufficient, this means that the army has secured, with its new purchase, - and also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, soldiers from the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shootings are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body laundry.
"And I don't care if they buy us so many detonating ropes".
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing".
"For us the military is a good customer that we as traders strive to satisfy", says Jan Decky, commercial director of STV Group.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes is because the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that the life span of the detonating ropes is only four years and the police and military firearms technicians only two years.
"If they are stored in the warehouses perfectly, it can take up to four years", said one who did not want his name to be published given the criticism of the army.
The lifetime of each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of detonation ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km", says Pejsek, who interprets the Ministry of Defence buyers' opinion.
Just to compare: the annual use of the detonation ropes by the police fire engineers who neutralized the ammunition of World War II or those of the Soviet army after that, does not exceed 1,500 meters.
And the police still only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for safety reasons for the fire engineers and to enable more flexible production of more modern and reliable types of detonating strings.
The Ministry of Defence is now having major problems neutralizing tens of tons of munitions from the Warsaw Pact when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits the Czech army that MF DNES contacted in a few years is to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it now buys "cheaply".
To this day, I am taking advantage of the contacts I have gained through competitions.
The sale of his hotel under a franchise has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur award.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacked a quality, affordable accommodation site.
With his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small five-room building that was half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something", says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building he turned into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, he had another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have come forward", the number one contractor of last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the win in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well", Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and fame in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the streets, often complimented me, and I must say, it was very pleasant", he recalls.
He recommends that all who are trying to do something participate in this competition.
It's not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be seen is good.
He says he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have gotten otherwise.
"I started to have regular business relationships with those I met through the competition.
He said the reputation of the success also had an impact on the employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed themselves to something that has been generally recognized".
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is being pushed forward", says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winning goal, Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to collect the Slovansky dum prize for first place in the company of the year competition organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded his efforts to turn a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but also my colleagues and increased our confidence in the fight against competition,' says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the Communists confiscated the property, he didn't hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and started a company with a few comrades around his father for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after, they began specialising in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it became the largest automated press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company was even known to the non-specialist public after the media success of the competition.
"Not only did our customers really get to know Farmet better, but foreign partners also started to realize that they were working with a company that had the greatest success in its home country", says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year's event was not just in Farmet in the euphoria of victory.
The company was assessed on the basis of the economic results of 2008 and partly 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year for engineering machines to sell.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation".
"The sales fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit production and even lay off", explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that unpopular measures must be taken from time to time.
But they managed the situation well and kept the benefits even if they were lower than they were before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the funds, strengthened the company's presence in international exhibitions and won major awards at national exhibitions", says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of businesses are rising and with them the number of employees.
"I wish the new winner this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere", says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates the stupid regulations.
The year's Absurdity poll is now part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The unfortunate winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year poll was the requirement to bring documents to the offices that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, while the official could obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
It's changed with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extraction from the trade register for insurance payments checks", said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
The aim of this year's Absurdity Contest is to highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organised by Hospodarske noviny and is even more popular.
If last year 3,000 voters turned out, at least 4,000 this year have cast their vote.
And it's no wonder there are in our country a variety of legal obligations that only curb business, and increasingly.
"We may be among the top tax returns in the world", says Karel Havlicek of the Czech Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
The situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all compared with the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of terms of business, up 8 places from last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first launched in 2006 and continues every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition ends.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is available for the report. The organiser of the contest then selects seven candidates for the "antiprize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The foolishness that gets the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, there were a hundred or more, 105 regulations and decrees that had lost their meaning.
The comments are sent by contractors, but also by trade unions and teachers.
The finalists of the competition, therefore, include the requirement that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay the toll, or that contractors with 20 employees refurbish two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always starts in early November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
For example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the closing ceremony.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts thorns in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate business,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people disliked was the requirement for contractors to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual business where the business is located, their intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment to the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day work trip for a foreign employee, was abolished with the Green Card Act.
And everything's fine until the third session of the contest.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by a decree of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sport projects are evaluated.
The new feature of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been running for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the business in a reasonable and fair way.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impact of their businesses and conduct socially responsible activities", says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which is the sponsor and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
For this first year of the 2010 firm contest, organised by Vodaphone, companies that are not successful with only one long-term objective for the company entered the competition.
The adventures of each of them are rich in inspiration and an independent article should be edited.
Although the purpose of their activities is different from each other, their support and forecasting activities can be considered the defining characteristic of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns disabled persons and their employees' personal or health problems.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague-based Prologue company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams from its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for disabled children for 17 years.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent of the workforce, was awarded the title of Central Bohemian Manager and placed third in the region in the company of the year competition organised by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won by introducing relaxed working hours and even reducing to 35 hours per week on average and without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a decade-old business in the surrounding area and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The IT company Enlogit in the Usti Region also takes care of the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Shadow Man Foundation, which helps the local Roma community", says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last category is also a Carlovy Vary Laundry and Cleaning Company, which provides employees with over-standard pension insurance.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased skills and leisure", says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition who had completed the questionnaires attached to the registration document and submitted it to the organiser before 15 August were automatically entered in the Responsible company category.
The organiser removed the questionnaire's incorrect or incomplete answers from the competition.
"If the representatives of the competing firms did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition of the Responsible Firm but were not disqualified from the main competition of the Vodaphone Firm of the Year".
"Independent entries are not possible because this is a sub-category of the Firm's main competition of the year", explains Karel Goldman of Bison&Rose.
At the Plzen Land Fund, police made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed the local contractor and real estate developer Lubos.
The Commission had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a return application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
This one was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a tender and public tender", said Plzen Prosecutor Antonie Zelena, who is aware that further explanations are not allowed as the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To know how it might influence a public competition, one can only speculate given the small amount of official information.
When asked by Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and not an employee", she said.
The public tender according to Cerna has the actual name 'Call to propose land transfer rights under the Land Act' and is set up when several candidates apply for the right.
'These persons are offering, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their resituation rights which must be settled before the value of the land is announced.'
"Under the proposed rights a list of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights", the Fund spokesman explained.
Mr Lubos G. clearly had information on the persons who had registered for the call and, as he himself is also a beneficiary, had bought a large number of refund entitlements and had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably made a living with the fact that he retired.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the FdT (Land Funds) standards.
It was included in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, for example, in the place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
He later traded it with the city hall for a building in the historic center of the city that is far more valuable.
The city council was forced to accept because otherwise it could put the construction in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra 100 crowns a month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
So families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month from their wallets from January onwards.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 crowns a year for apartment households, more than it is currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat up and therefore consume it most.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the price of central heating varies from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that are planning to raise prices.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is planned in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, the Prague residents will pay a 6.8 percent surcharge.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
The prices of rents will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 000 apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase the number to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rent will be brought to justice by the company.
The regulated rent that people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could rise by 10 percent next year.
Czech children are getting drunk on rum and fernet, beer is out of fashion and is acting slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring into the hands of the doctor those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old.
Children who are treated in hospital for relapse are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospital children's departments.
"Beers and wines are out of fashion because it takes time to get drunk".
'The trend is really strong alcohol,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to crack a bottle of daddy's in the closet, it's sometimes whiskey, but it's fern and vodka that prevails.
"The advantage of vodka is that they can mix it with fruit juice and not smell it", explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"It's usually rum or fern".
"It's the trendy alcohol today, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice they brought home", Jurinova added.
According to the head of the department, Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 admitted to hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before he started working at Horovice last year, he was in Motol where he spent exactly ten years in pediatrics where ambulances were bringing schoolchildren from wide areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with a blend of ecstasy", the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party".
"What is interesting is that it did not seem strange to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours", said the Department Director astonished.
It is the disinterestedness of parents or their unusual tolerance of their children's drinking that is the main cause of childhood alcoholism.
However, experts say that the term "addiction" is not used in the strict sense of the term for children.
"Alcoholism is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the consequences but not found in children".
"For those who drink repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable social and family background", explained Department Head Pelikan.
According to Jurinova, about 40 children who had been drunk were hospitalized in the Motol pediatric clinic until mid-November this year.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in statistics.
Children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting down and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, Pelikan says that there are three seasonal waves that can be counted on: Witch Day, Holy Silvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of disgust after poor results or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"Of course I have witnessed witches' day when seven drunk children were admitted at once", Pelikan pointed out.
The child who spent the night in the hospital under medical supervision in detox is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the next day from "wood fever".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by infusing glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They're better off for that because they have a great evening and then a sweet wake-up and nothing hurts them".
"They are just surprised at where they are", Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time this spoils the patients' good mood at least with the fee to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalization in intensive care beds can cost up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this occasionally as a means of education by counting the costs of their drinking and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for one evening", added Pelikan.
However, he said that in their declining management, health insurance companies, which should recover from parents the costs of care, do not treat cases of drunken children.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two L-159s out of five, which the Ministry of Defence traded for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time such a device has ever been owned by someone other than the Czech military.
However, they have been abroad for exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1 which were previously in service with the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is unknown at this time.
'The L-159 single-seaters scheduled for the exchange have been taken from long-standing aircraft without incurring any additional costs or investment for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 bicycles were exchanged in the state", said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be left without two seats since the ministry signed a 200 million crown deal with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unused L-159 single-seaters into two seats.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159s are EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries".
"It is therefore up to the person who takes into account how this is done", Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not open a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only uses 24 of them, and wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
The European Commission has however brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of a low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the thumb are at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a shorter right hand index finger than the thumb index.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
However, for those with a longer index than the ring finger the risk dropped to 33 percent, while for men under 60 the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned above - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
If you don't have testosterone, you have a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of the study but did not seem to believe that the link between finger length and cancer was "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is covered in snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, and the deburgers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway was closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway from Brno towards Prague suffered the same fate.
The dispatcher from the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
On the 91st kilometer a truck crashed, on the 93rd two heavyweights hit each other, the accident injured.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer to Prague.
Two trucks hit the road.
Drivers should either exit just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter at 182 km in Kyvalka.
A line of cars formed several miles away at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there's an accident and it's just on the way to Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car lines are being created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are delayed on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague crisis staff is still to meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to cut off seven expressways due to snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems.
Travelers should be in control of the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday at 11pm until 5am.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but vigilance is being increased.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impractical, on the Brno road there is snowflakes in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass certain routes of communication in places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the hardest hit places.
The routes between Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice are still closed.
To clean them up, we may need to send snowmen and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate when they'll be rolling.
On the Hodonin road, caution is strict in the White Carpaths region.
On roads that are, with respect to nature protection, maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a 5 cm layer of snow, CTK warns.
In the Czech Republic, between two and 10 centimeters of snow fell, and in northern Bohemia, it fell the most, often with up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the point of contact with the target but also at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall, or a ditch.
He's also not protected from above, and when a deadly rain of steel blasts falls on him, it can knock him out of battle too.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser beam to it that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of aim, according to which he corrects his point of aim and presses on the detachment.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters".
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of about 1, 2, 3 meters", Audette said.
400 relocated jobs
Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area.
Fujitsu Group of Japan is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next July the workplace of 400 men and women, which is now located in Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be moved to Astro Park, a huge office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group would add 100 more jobs still scattered throughout the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the open-air offices at Astro Park are better suited to the work mode of the employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The director-general, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that airport connectivity is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been won.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company", said Mr Korwisi.
However, the friendship could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the building in Marienbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The point is to prevent such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will cooperate".
Ten years ago, the City Hall Square building, used until now by Fujitsu and the nearby "little vertical", along with the rest of the buildings on Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project between the municipality and a private developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the City Hall, which attracted much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that were once partly used for parking but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialist Immobilien-Chancen group bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential services.
Fujitsu's branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad.
For this purpose, 7,000 square metres were rented from the Astro Park building.
The 20-year-old complex, named after its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrical Industries.
Amazon expelled the server - threats against Mr Assange
WikiLeaks is in increasing trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the website dedicated to the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may be a cover for political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks website is under increasing attack.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a web host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server".
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom", said the cyber activists behind the revelations on Twitter on Wednesday.
Not long ago, the cyber-company Amazon had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the secret diplomatic notes were released, cyber activists used Amazon's Web Service (AWS) to gain access to the most documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidably, our dollars are now being spent on taking care of people in Europe".
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after an investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's staff.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Protecting the Territory had threatened Amazon to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step earlier in view of previous publications by WikiLeaks of classified information", the senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse to use the platform's servers.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and life at risk everywhere in the world", the independent senator said in a statement.
"No company, American or foreign, that is aware of its responsibilities should help WikiLeaks distribute the content of stolen documents".
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities for alleged rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to reports in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently called the Swedish prosecution of him a plot orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"A call has even been made for the murder of Julian Assange".
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why the founder of WikiLeaks keeps hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the revelations made by WikiLeaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, said on television, apparently ironically, that Mr Assange should be "killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website", says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website".
The US government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, has been appointed to the task of fighting the leak.
Mr Travers is responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it will take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice makers are trained for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day inaugural course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
From the glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, or in German the somewhat outdated ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, puts it in the wafer and then starts selling it.
To know, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about ice can't avoid the Italian firm Carpigiani's "Gelato-University".
The drink maker founded the ice cream college in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day inaugural course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered, which last for several days.
In the midst of a crisis of quarantine, some people dream of a new career, while others simply risk fulfilling their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries on every continent, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a California art education teacher, is a big fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to bring a quality European product to the industrial ice country in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business consultant and after a few years she wants to get something out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wanted to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Icemaster Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal features of perfect ice.
Not only is the good flavor of the silk essential, but also the flexibility and consistency of the silk.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the southern: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a great dose of romance".
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap on the machine and takes out a white, pasteurized base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who only talk about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have nevertheless used stabilizers - most often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crush nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
There's also powder and pasta.
"the vendors will all try to get you dozens of flavored ingredients".
"You should just try, though".
Or in the fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is either in ice cream made from white base which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all the participants in the class must switch to ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka, and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More flavoring, more fruit purees - from a taste standpoint, it's not much better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste like walnuts, when it is mostly made of hazelnuts.
The popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture can properly enhance the taste of ice cream", says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice cream is a calculation: if you use fish purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
A supplement of sugar is needed for the lemon ice cream.
Luciano introduced a device to determine the sugar content of different types of fruit (wine farmers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape wine).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to calculate.
The manufacture of ice does not require as much physical intervention as it did in the past.
It is not only the automatic mass-producing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously battered to make it onctuous and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbecuing from head to toe with a purée of fruit and splashing his fellow students when he is out of control of the colossal blender bowl.
Master Luciano believes that "such an incident is likely to occur during each class - it is only a matter of time".
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has become a core of the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we know it", said Testbiotech's CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
Some reports indicate that the Chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on GMOs, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of EFSA test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr Then's criticisms.
The requirements drawn up correspond, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which would be controlled by the authorities in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta without any conditions or transitional period, changing her position.
Recently even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed that there were personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicion from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not admit any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is exploited as long as it is of good professional quality.
The experts working for EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi, based in the United States.
The organisation considers itself a neutral forum bringing together experts from, inter alia, the fields of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the environmental impact of these plants has not been tested.
"We want to know what the effects of genetically modified maize are, for example, on the field", says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If we do not look for risks, how can we discover them?" Mr. Then asks in an accusative tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are still few researchers who are not connected to societies.
The companies believe that the critical studies will not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "security research is controlled by industry".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell got himself some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing outside the Stuttgart train station with her tube behind her.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, excavators had come and started demolishing much of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central train station into a multi-billion-dollar underground train station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the construction being halted.
Breaking into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the crayfish limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft, rough pavement built poorly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor based in Ostfildern.
He got some of it.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthusiastically says: "A modest and cheap, simple, earthly rock".
He said that when he cut it with the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell is also here.
The Stuttgart stone traces lead to an old French army munitions depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is a stone-old trader.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill", he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard station.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained that there was nothing he could do to stop the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the stone parallel pipes weighing an average of 80 kilograms, with a value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in the hope of also being able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads from a truck.
About half are still crammed into the forest, the rest long since sold.
Gardeners, landscapers, private owners.
They came from all over the place and took everything that could get into the box and the trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart's scandal have long since become "Mäuerle" or the limits of the grasslands.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special", says Mr. Rongen.
"was not that political component".
He gets into his car all over the place, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law but dropped out, and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40,000 tons of storage.
He's amassing treasure all over Germany.
HE claims to be the greatest trader of ancient stones.
He's holding back.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the Marienbrücke to Dresden bridge".
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favourite stone".
He's taking the path that goes up through the forest.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on and so forth.
"Joli travertine".
The parallel epiphany was once part of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the red granite from St. Blasien's Cathedral, the tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple pallets and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such an inheritance were to be broken up".
He didn't get rich, much less rich.
But today, the carrier employs 14 people, and in the forest have been established stone carvers, sculptors, blacksmiths, glass blowers, and gardeners.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding", says the waste recycler.
He's about to go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved there too.
Struggling for Talent to Conquer High Potential
The counter is a busy place.
16 students are scrambling to buy salmon buns, tomato sauce and white-eater.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they need to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies are willing to go head-to-head in competition for better brains and, like Volkswagen, to engage in multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible into the amphitheatres before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performance, we try to identify exceptional talent in practical projects and build loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is training talent.
A young lady in the personnel department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the timetable of internships and student jobs for young talent and shows them the ways to get to the group premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
He believes that there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience".
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at serious applicants and appreciate those who join the account as a partner".
Mr. Sessel said such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive that we're trying to use to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was on professional projects", says Mr Selle.
The struggle for the new graduates will become much more fierce.
In the property sector, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a number of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, they must be attracted to highly skilled labor.
It is especially graduates from engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineer jobs were unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the vacancy in engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta is going talent hunting for KPMG, an accounting, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students to the United States next year to travel in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The candidate shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used to seek out high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race".
"A simple cruise was too little for us"
To Mr. Dykta, the talent hunter, the count seems to be there.
"To date, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar activity last year".
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to apply to our company soon", he says.
In addition to direct training on campus, small and mediumsized enterprises are doing this in a very traditional way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brainwashing.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows".
"For example, at the solar technology show", says Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of solar panels.
The company, which is based in Bonn, employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 posts are being contested on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies".
"It's expensive and time consuming", he says.
Another way to make contact is to contact university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to take professional internships or to write his final project at our home".
The solar industry is advertising expensive advertising campaigns.
This is why the company tries to promote itself by emphasizing other qualities: personalized ambiance, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group cannot do this", says Staff Director Stübe.
Money has long been the main source of employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honourable list of German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employee framework conditions.
The Head of Staff, Mrs Stübe, hopes that this placement will help raise the company's image with jobseekers.
"I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments for a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means taking internal action first and foremost.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees", he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the industry, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own staff.
"satisfied employees are the best messengers".
When employees are treated well and are familiar with the company, they will be able to advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra", says Kriegler.
Obama is putting a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern U.S.A., in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban on the equivalent ban and thus permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had indicated that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is still not settled.
The British oil group, which faces claims for compensation totaling several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze from the drilling order after the platform exploded.
Following this decision, several oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced they would remove the lucrative tax niches of the oil and gas companies.
The Gulf industry is now publicly warning that the flow of food in the Gulf will be much lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector", according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of the drilling ban announced on Wednesday.
The American Enery Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation".
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni land is dry
The water in the rivers is brownish-oil-brown, and it gives off a smell similar to that found in the gas station.
Men live off theft, corruption and refining oil.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't tire out", the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down, "you still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man immersed in muddy water up to his chest, along with the greasy trail around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water glow.
You can't see the basement is full of brownish oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she once collected shrimp in buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil leaked from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen in the nearby small town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: Ogoni, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The extent of the damage is noticeable when walking through the mangrove swamps and streams.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits a crashing brown water, and anyone who dives in it pulls out a full oil coating.
The roots of the mangroves emerge from the ground like a log of roses, and the isolated palm trees sadly leave their palms hanging.
The search for bird clouds is futile, as is usually the case in wetlands: As soon as the engine stops, a ghostly silence descends upon this ancient paradise that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment", says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad face. "Our lives are characterized by a permanent health hazard".
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a battlefield besieged for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered the region; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa; the latter was later executed; in 1993, the Shell Group had to stop production in the region because it had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to Ogoni is prohibited: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the entire Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred yards of steel trellis stand in the water like strange sculptures: The heads of the holes are affectionately called "Christmas trees".
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are eaten up by corrosion to the point of reference.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that over two billion litres of oil have been spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the same amount of oil spilled into the sea as the Exxon Valdez super tanker accident 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the worst environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
Shell Group says that oil pipeline sabotage and sifting are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, and environmentalists consider explosion of drilling heads and drilling pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell for applying in Nigeria essentially less stringent safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failure of pipelines is "still much higher than previously".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop full of bamboo and set up outdoors: completely naked and covered with bamboo from the neck down.
A fire sparkling under one of the many pipes that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a cause on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tank for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
First, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then the droplets of kerosene fall at the end of the pipe, and finally diesel is produced.
So Michael and his four associates produce four 300-liter barrels of diesel a day: "That's worth us 34,000 Naira", about $22 a day.
The people of the Delta benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a ridiculously low price of just 40 cents a liter of diesel: they get their raw material for free.
The country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the Niger Delta, according to experts.
Only a very small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion's share of tankers and the brandy onto the global market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal theft and no illegal refineries".
But in the meantime, Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it has been a matter of withdrawing the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove better".
Then Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you left", says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time".
If illegal refiners are caught by special forces, they will not be arrested, but they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, want to enjoy the raw material as all Nigerians do.
"In every way, this fucked-up thing has brought down our country very low", regrets Akpori.
Investigators have found defects in the A380's reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major safety problem.
When investigators examined a device that made an emergency landing, they discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure".
Qantas Airlines now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, passengers on the Quantas Airbus had apparently been happier so far: during its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors on some A380s had a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it could cause fatigue and leaks at the oil pipeline connection, according to a position taken by the ATSB administration on Thursday.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
The relevant parts are Rolls-Royce-made reactors equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them was the Quantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken the English reactor manufacturer to court.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas's chief executive, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages for the incident in early November.
Parts broke off and the carrier surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, the oil flame is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors are now to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos, which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, Quantas Airlines had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily halted three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa has, as a precaution, replaced the A380 reactor.
The two-stage plane is the world's largest airliner.
Snowfall across the territory causes a chaos in transport
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos is everywhere, trains and planes are still.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Germany is frozen in winter: Almost all of the republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in each place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they could not cope with the constantly accumulating snow.
Moreover, violent storms swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal storms to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow on the highways and on the federal roads has caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather forecast station Meteomedia announced the level of purple alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, about a foot [30 cm] of cold snow fell and was scattered by strong, cool winds.
Several trucks and cars got stuck in it at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious disturbances on roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic to be interrupted and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on railways, fallen trees on railways, damaged cataracts and needles.
In Saxony, interregional transportation from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to provide the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall has caused many flights to be cancelled at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said 40 flights had already been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
Although there are few passengers stuck at the airport, only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of snow on the roads. Even here, a truck was stuck in a level crossing because the vehicle was stuck there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car hit a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will swirl when there is a slight blast.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees Celsius in some places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank is trying to break away from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, the bank is looking for buyers for its two office buildings in its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the Group's headquarters: the twin towers in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former office.
The financial group is now apparently looking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper quoted a spokesman as saying.
The spokesman did not give the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we were checking whether it was more interesting to take over the buildings ourselves or sell them, and rent them back later".
The largest financial institution in Germany had already ceded its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was not until mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers from equity holders for EUR 272 million and subsequently rehabilitated them.
The energy efficiency transformations have been estimated to have cost around €200 million.
Of course, a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Green Towers", at around 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unknown whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the miners buried who were declared dead as a result of several mine explosions.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation at the disaster well remains precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent explosion, authorities and administration had considered that the miners had no chance of survival.
So far, the bodies have not been able to be brought back.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a memorial service for the dead.
Thousands of people gathered in the sunshine of Greymouth, New Zealand's southern island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets, and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
Flags were hoisted in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative party that New Zealand had raised the hope that miners would return to the surface.
"But they never came home".
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the trenches, said he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers have started extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", a fighter epic.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is captured, freeing himself from his trap and, with almost supernatural force, eliminating his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When in a bad mood, he snatches the guts of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the character does not say a word about his real name, and even the other characters, at most, leave out a few terrible cries of agony by the wayside of one or two sentences.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous scenery of Scotland that forms the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent traveling.
When a film targets several target groups, it's a shame that these are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the wild and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and experimental cinema.
Most art-film enthusiasts must be horrified by the brain that is spreading all around and in the intestines.
Action movie lovers are bored when the ship sails, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity in the calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is therefore not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and is available only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not about dialogue in this film, or consistent action, it's all ambiance, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly slits his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but most of all with an elusive hatred that springs from the characters' hearts.
Only a young blond boy, who stands loyal to the baron, maintains some innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the hero of the Borgne whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, decayed.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated or admired, with the aim of annoying, enthusiastic and astonishing.
It was a traumatic experience.
Mysterious groundbreaking work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, much less submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River, and the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers away - Dair as-Sur.
Its name is in the IAEA documents because it's about the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallel elephant, hidden in a valley marked by no electricity.
According to a US intelligence briefing, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, is likely to produce plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been in use since the 1950's.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurry satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the plant was destroyed, which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
She also showed pictures of the building nearby or inside.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is little more information available than then, and even with time the mystery grows deeper and deeper.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, and the IAEA lacks.
When asked how he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, saying that the IAEA had "enough documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and carried out a systematic leveling of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from a Member State of commercial providers showing the timing of the attack directly after the attack.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
The IAEA is therefore unable to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analysing the particles, calling it unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this issue, as has satellite imagery.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the site of al-Kibar and refuses access to the debris of the bomb-ravaged building.
But even Israel is stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this".
The investigation into the case has been ongoing since June 2008 and has not been successful, and it is "increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility for the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits, and is ultimately a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarification of the existence of the other three installations which must have a 'functional relationship' with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are involved, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively, as well as the names of the nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered a complex near Masyaf on satellite images that is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly next to it, which is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. intelligence officials that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallel elephant to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "use for fuel production".
It would have "no indication of any sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are quite plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where should uranium have come from and where would the plutonium needed to make the bomb have been subsequently separated.
It is not known whether the gravestones, which could hide valuable traces, were stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt disappear, no one will have information about where the gravy is stored.
The IAEA says it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from El-Kibar, across the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently, by analyzing satellite images for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked the images to the reactor.
Satellite images show, however, that Syria undertook grounding work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may have been a coincidence, but that has not helped to dispel suspicions.
The report said that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been reported for this matter, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring for some months to what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Energy Agency has to carry out its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already mentioned "an option I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a good number of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
But, like that diplomat who gives a thought to himself, "What's the use of that, if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in Wartime
It's been a long time since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut this summer.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian descent.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian boyfriend during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response some of the filming scheduled for Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to reports in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War Organization wrote to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress, who is herself a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered these women a meeting in Hungary, but they declined.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says a lot about her attitude toward victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the UN High Commissioner's Office remove Angelina Jolie as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author herself says that she is not pursuing political goals with her film, that it was through much effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet. It is quite different: the lovers knew each other long before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the version "a rape victim falls in love with her own butt".
That Jolie's filming started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on false information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this script on the Internet, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, the Irish are doing fine again.
No sign of dismay.
This is why the local team is overly dominant over visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are shouting for joy in the background of loud music, they trample their feet.
The Baileyu-Pub in Cork in southern Ireland is vibrating because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from a distance of three metres into the opposing team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong", and the winner pockets 500 euros plus a plane ticket to attend the World Beer-pong Championships in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
Yet, despite all this, the 26-year-old tries to have fun, to avoid the terrifying question that will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not part of his plans, and in January, he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling", he says.
"My homeland is so far away and I have no job".
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two years she has got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign", the young man said with a smile.
Because of the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now works as a computer consultant in London.
Young People Going Away: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even plan to have 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, there will be a flow of emigration comparable to that in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom, during which the Irish enjoyed great prosperity, grief has now become a commonplace.
The economic crisis, however, is particularly affecting the well-educated young people of Ireland, who have had only happy moments so far.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everybody had a job, there's an excess of money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has published extensively letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going wrong in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity to do so, goes away and our country goes away for a generation".
"The last one to leave turns off the light".
The student of law Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing dust in the eye and offers no prospects for the young.
"They cut the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs", says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her classmates clinging from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought".
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon is organising the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme of "work abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy", says the official.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a barrier, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for the 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he takes part in an extra job, so he can finish paying off the loan to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy", he said, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live much anymore".
He burst out laughing embarrassed as he walked through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, and expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house he shared with his sister for 380,000 euros, 100% financed by the loan.
"These were crazy times, no doubt, money was easy", he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sips hot tea and says: "I have no children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero".
The building engineer doesn't like the complaints he's heard often lately.
"No one should go hungry, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and life in Ireland was just going on".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Let go of the future and see how life is going elsewhere.
In his book, he's already had a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand shouldn't be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is something else that has been troubling her in the last few days: the celebration of her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's worried that it might turn into a goodbye night.
"Just, not much emotion", he said as he drank a long sip of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing anyway".
"Let's call it a goodbye party, relaxed, gathering some friends, with a few drinks and some games".
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related findings emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the pretty sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which brings the regional average down (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their country was functioning in practice, the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Graph 3)
Some 34% said they trusted their country's Parliament and 45% their government, the same as last year in both cases, but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
If this has been maintained during the global financial crisis, it is certainly because many American countries have experienced only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security system has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
But mood varies greatly from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since the survey began, more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime as the most important problem for their country rather than unemployment (see Table 5).
Some 31% say they or a loved one has been the victim of a crime in the past year, but this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree with this view (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, with 19% of respondents mentioning it (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year).
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in disaster and in fear.
Voting boxes and a new election were presented, ballots scattered across the governorates, polling stations destroyed and intimidation
The polling stations were open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood looking for places to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and demanded the election be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Haiti, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for a vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support from voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was concern that participation would be.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 voting ID cards were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, obviously, the Haitians are doing it themselves.
The tip of the feet to the center
Weeks after becoming suddenly a widow, Argentine President Cristina Fernández has received a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rating by 20 points to more than 50 percent, her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, whether this will be a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms Fernández's choice, which is clearly mourning, whether or not she will abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in that regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into chaos following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissidents of the ruling Peronist movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not argue", said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating considerably, and is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure as close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, put growth and poverty reduction ahead of inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit the pay increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Ms Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the obligors who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not paid its debts in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández will remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is very prevalent.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly reject her husband's many policies.
Half an hour to China
Taiwanese voters have turned to a sort of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70 percent of eligible people, registered on November 27 to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts as part of what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having forged innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just like that.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five seats, he failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all the votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including heavy-duty campaign trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal costume.
A mysterious forced assassination attempt was also made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a ballot for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot Mr. Lien in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the killing had consequences on the election by leading suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates joined the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid disrupting its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is in response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to trick Taiwan back into the fold.
China has sent a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It is true that she would like to see political integration, but let us start at the beginning.
It's better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, his condition was bad: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is doing everything it can to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can also engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party has a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems upset about this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have gotten better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor; despite the dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates refused to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local antennas will be reworked.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorial writer, "the point of no return has already passed".
Grammy Award nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selection in the "Best New Artist" category
Do it at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the artist's public identity".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly took a step forward and, given her slightly engaging vocal style, her skilful hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to the flashing success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters considering jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "Instrumental Album" category, a thrilling departure from a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among the competitors will be "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, New Orleans's favorite loud voice and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly toward a certain fusion with albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the big band category; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live octet album "Pathways" was a fine example of the bassist's democratic hand as bandleader.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
Among the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"s; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in contention for a prize.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classical producer of the year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album include Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House Orchestra, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "Love Far Away" by the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York City.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated for the category of Best Orchestra Performance for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received nominations were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated soloists: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording of "Racines: My Life, My Song"
The project of the Temecula mosque has won the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula was unanimously supported by the local planning commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often enthusiastically.
Critics have criticized the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support it - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he added.
"They just have very loud voices".
"We have good people in this valley".
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, for the most part, people speaking for or against the centre, with the time of speech almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", wrote one speaker.
"It's another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has coexisted happily in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque would be made up of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicholas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the bill to the city council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new life on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as a nutrient, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can develop with either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That's why it's very special, even if it's far from being a really 'strange' life form", said Paul Davies C.W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday's Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible", said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss the find, which did not disclose details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report may reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments organisms may be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed", said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't on the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately".
"But arsenic is different enough that it does not work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates the inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine", Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced with phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of Earth's existence, she says, and so researchers have speculated that early life forms may have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton.
The other two show dogs on four robberies outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembrokes - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine", says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They were returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, and what the circumstances were when they were discovered.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say it", Whitmore said.
"We follow orders".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to be reached to provide comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old male Trace and a 10-month-old female Didi - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek were planning to show at regional dog shows this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until they were discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the "AKC/Eukanuba" National Championship in Long Beach, where they were going to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly one-month canine exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their bedroom.
They took three other dogs - a dog Boxer, a Terrier Parson Russell, and a Breton Spaniel - and they stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they'd offer a reward for anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, the restructuring of MGM is just waiting for the final green light from the courthouse
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City officially praised Thursday the "prepackaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion in debt would be wiped out, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing films and television shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, there are no legal barriers left to MGM getting back on the water under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightweight studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance MGM's new operations and production.
It is currently being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is itself valued at $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and restoration expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's 140+ creditors took much longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be rebuilt as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million "success premium".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch production at MGM, which has only released one film this year, and to put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its stake in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
Although the top contender for this year's most wonderful toy is iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a big break in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 traditional pearl jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
Clearly Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more power; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more to offer.
And button-battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a pig from India that sing a note when you press on their stomachs.
One pressure is equal to a note, and a second pressure allows you to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Be careful: once you start pushing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based role-playing games like Simon Says and can dance to the moon with its innovative articulated feet with wheel-blocking.
Kids who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you'll remember Alfie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of quiz game cards designed to turn a drive into a session with self-correction and a valve book.
If you're suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60 for 3-8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70 for 3- to 12-year-olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for 3-7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a lightbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for ages 6 to 12) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child gets enough credit from the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It could be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
A little larger than the hair on the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button-cell micro-robot.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Our dog's dog could not fall from the kitchen table and even pass through the mouth for a moment.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin was walking through a city square as a trained city sergeant, strictly inspecting his nerve loads, quietly issuing orders to a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - imposing public policy officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and inclination to violence - to give a certain impression to a group of viewers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be careful!"
"Show them what pretty girls look like", he said.
Four girls, who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, wearing identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, were on guard duty.
Four pairs of black heels, aligned with the rule.
Four well-groomed hats perched on top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they look average", said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are beautiful".
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a high school diploma.
Guangdong province has traded the grey-green uniforms for a blue one that is said to be more engaging.
Wuhan, central China, replaced the down-eye with a strong: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by staring at it, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his bags and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police force with 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, complexion and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble getting attention on this underground city brigade in China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat to death an observer after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat criminals without shedding blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry colporteur was left with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows Chinese trained inspectors raiding street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year, after another controversy over tactics.
The paper called for a "true, complete cleanup".
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district announced in October that eight new female recruits were to be hired, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had real jobs or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and "five facial features in the right order".
They must be taller than average, or 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2.5 inches.
Retirement at 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"It's their image that matters", a district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the outer qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable - they are the height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
Chengguan women are like flower pots, he said, adding: "In addition to being pots, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
What it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured persons do not have to apply.
"We cannot let a crippled or lame person come here to serve", says Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't give a good image".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has a slightly curved mouth.
She doesn't consider showing off her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked in a disappointed look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague at the trenches, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city".
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had higher career ambitions than simply chasing salesmen out of the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team deals with a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu and breadcrumbs as possible before they run away.
"Master Wang, you must leave".
"We've told you many times already!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart.
The agents describe their duties as more monotonous than arduous.
"It's pretty much the same thing every day", said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies after-work marketing.
"It's a big routine".
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public exposures of hostility against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The motorcycle owner was shouting at the scandal.
A 15-minute firefight followed before the dark-faced police, with their elbows bent over the road to their vehicle, and they quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Liedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supporting role.
In contrast, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts".
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving a former campaign aide and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the wife's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Justice Department had "informed him that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that it had no intention of continuing any charges against him in this case".
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there would be significant evidence to suggest that Mr. Ensign was conspiring to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer on an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called ban on lobbying.
"There appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantially violate the door-to-door law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
While the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-profile setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the director general of Citizens Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's senior counsel, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a prosecutor at the Justice Department and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's legal team had cooperated with prosecutors in trying to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a prominent Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marting" the Home Office on a matter at issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Transportation Secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After holding a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would soon follow the example of the Justice Department and end his investigation.
Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were typing in the long lines of the courtroom.
They were sending every minute of reports of horrible testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense said there were over 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of murdering three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to end officially with a judge imposing the death penalty, as voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeals arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter by journalists - has created a "circus atmosphere", such widespread and instantaneous saturation with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt the appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the human rights to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr Hayes, chief counsel.
Judge Jon C. Bleue of the State Supreme Court laconically dismissed the claims in the judgment given last week, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was motivated by passion.
But that doesn't seem to be the last word on the matter.
The courts of appeals have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, arguing in its ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which could be discussed for years, delaying execution.
The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of crime scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jury members said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate within a weekend.
The jury wasn't seized.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept stirring up the emotion of the case.
"The daily roaring of tweets from the media, cameras, and journalists outside the courthouse", wrote the lawyers, "was nothing like anything seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide".
Their emphasis on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that news stories were more incendiary than slowly delivered reports was a Luddite view that would undermine the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that appeals courts were often drawn to the argument that social and technological changes required court accommodation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on that claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the 21st century Sheppard v. Maxwell case".
Can civility bring the divisions closer?
After a campaign marked by inventiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of a real bipartisan cooperation going forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders on Tuesday produced no breakthroughs on the major issues that must be addressed during the "walking duck" session.
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
The public meeting of the Committee on the President's Deficit on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends ideological divisions, but which still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual testing and testing to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
But the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions and then they fade.
It's good".
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "walking duck" session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise on extending unemployment benefits is possible, even if it is because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is more optimism about possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "walking duck" with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea-loving voters who helped to create it.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These pro-democracy positions are already clear in the first reactions to the Committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, they say, have imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time getting to that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected officials, suggesting that there are few reasons or will to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston has two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that despite the party spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both parties will watch the public's reaction closely.
Whoever is judged to be a loser will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more significant election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility presented this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is under the control of a "Kleptocracy" and is passing some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
He said the police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "power vertical" - takes its part as money moves up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Lujkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little cleanup since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several libel trials on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting corruption: "It's crazy, it's throwing away, it's all bullshit".
The vast majority of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find information in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to think that diplomats from a foreign country would do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government", according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a krysha (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is on top".
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the bottom".
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services".
The report says the FSB is stealing money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than from organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law".
"This is why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is not so high anymore".
The note notes that although the collection of money is widespread, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly have their businesses closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note reports men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats", said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of a political class because there is no such class in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption in Russia as a whole would amount to over $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked least corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was made only yesterday late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is working to resolve the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be fabricated and reacted angrily to the claims that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country", he says.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, against ethics".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poorly-lit, decayed concrete walls, the principal of Long Veng High School spoke of the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here likes Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people", said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was the leader of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face the people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook there that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
This situation has increased the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Long Veng, complicating their reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"The situation is creating divisions within families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched a revolt that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla force from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ing Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held out, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into the black poverty common in rural Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some of the elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions as local leaders in return for laying down their arms, these were unskilled farmers with low status and background.
"These people have received very little follow-up after surrender", said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organises public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept".
Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Long Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone".
But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves".
The Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try the top officials and key criminals but it has not said whether it will proceed beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has been directed at Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced labourers were reportedly killed.
Recently, Im Chaem was returning from a hot evening of work in the field near his wooden, padded house on a dirt road outside Long Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
She said if the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there's more prosecution, there's going to be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects, although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces", he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand".
The Centre produced the first government-approved Khmer Red Handbook, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, 75 pages long".
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history books, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like most Cambodians, the youths of Long Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old high school student in Long Veng, said the new manual was helping students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents were skeptical when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the courtroom", he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the courtroom are starting to make an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a strong attraction here.
On the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, covered with weeds and covered with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black silk, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after he died in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he's a great spirit, " she said, "and many people go there to pray.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a vital component of nuclear weapons, as part of a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to abandon highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for a deal on Wednesday to eliminate the remaining material from around 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke of the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
It seems that the summit in 2012 was a good one to get an invitation to the former Soviet Republic.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves to me that this process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for World Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and weakly enriched uranium", Lukashenko said.
"This is our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus has been drawing closer to the United States a few months ago, but it has shown interest in reaching an agreement.
The first operation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been radiated slightly, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million on its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with poorly enriched uranium, unsuitable for weapons.
"Consistent coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official who specializes in reducing global threats.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens", she said.
The government has not objected to the CIA's thefts.
The government has not objected to the CIA's flight of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked by Wikileaks to El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed so that "they could demonstrate that they were adequately monitoring foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Zapatero Government out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to theft of intelligence over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken unintentionally", Aguirre says in a cable.
The then Foreign Ministry's head, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that he was not going to block the judge's request to declassify documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA thefts.
"These reports contain no incriminating material, no sensitive information", the embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed more concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his staff "to avoid commenting on inflammatory rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government", she reports.
The confessed parricide complained about the "overwhelming" motherhood
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
She used that nickname when she was a child, communicating with a cousin and at least a friend, both from Noia, her native village of the Coruña.
The messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, you need to know her love life, which ABC builds with the help of her parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Túñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get DNA tested.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after.
Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality, was elected.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idol broke apart, they separated.
In March 2008, she wrote, "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there".
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants".
And then she talks about a cell phone message she just got, "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send the baby to you".
Ella complains: "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the baby with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home", she alleges.
In May, she said of her return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will stay only until the 19th, because on the 20th I must present myself at a work station so as not to lose it".
She explains that if all went well, she would have taken her eldest son with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person unless that person is my mother", doubtful intent, considering their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits him, it's assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he's not happy on the other".
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day".
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"He'll go in a few hours in the summer and that's how I save some money for the babysitter".

The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the outlook is more than positive, because the number of votes this group gets in these committees is normally double that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the Catalan people got 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomy elections they got 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend of PSC voter diversion and loyalty to the PP electorate is maintained, the analysts of this formation have calculated that if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while the CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose no more or no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan position is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it now has three - while ICV would keep one or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting for the municipal committees will be held in May 2011, where the popular will also be decisive in ending socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relegation to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that handles the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and popularists agree that PSC could lose the Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona mayorships, where the socialists would not have the majority or the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this group to lose its representation in Barcelona's city hall - it is necessary to get 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its voting in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP registered only a difference of 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign they met several times.
Popularity has also improved in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police Information General Office were a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba (LAT), the latter of which was responsible for the bombings in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attached great importance to these investigations, to the extent that it ensured that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus was "weakened" internationally and "thus its operational capability".
Investigators estimate that within the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, it could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network has operated in Europe, which is why other European police units have been involved in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, and why there could be similar attacks in the European Union in the following days to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another operation was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who were in charge of the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be in the name of young men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking the detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, although the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before the attack, a transfer agency from Catalonia sent several thousand dollars which were "invested" to buy mobile cards which were later used by the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions for supporting his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are summed up in prioritizing the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address in the middle of his term.
The President of the Catalan People's Party arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that she had won 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the opposition groups abstain from voting for the inauguration.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are held in Catalan key.
In the case of the PP chairwoman, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independenceist speeches should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common stake in reducing the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax on inheritance and donations.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the caretaker La Caritat d'Olot (Geroné) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 elderly people for whom he was responsible during his time there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, accompanied by the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada, announced that "La Caritat would like to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to take on the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the major threat to La Caritat is now taking the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was in August 2009 and that since that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected that in many cases no doctors personally examined the deceased but, given the patients' age and pathologies, the formalities were carried out by telephone.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed explanation of the situation.
The La Caritat lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of imprudence on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already dubbed "the Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying that he sought a less cruel death for his first victims or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed to having done with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not rule out the possibility that the number is higher and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain at the disposal of the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differences have been closing tightly and European banks' shares have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, in the same way as it collapses, recovers, but driven by short and highly speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended 'at least until March' and that quarterly auctions will be kept open at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and even signal an intensification.
If they fail to meet the expectations they have, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as at their meeting in May they said they had not even considered buying bonds and they had collapsed the markets, the story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing another market crash.
Yesterday the one-year deal auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points along the entire curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, we have published the numbers for the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes.
The estimated figures are 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumptive in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a house of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech to ease tensions ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political compromise is needed to show that we are one and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of us want to play Beethoven's happy anthem.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to re-activate employment sound like Vivaldi's four seasons to investors.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market suffered 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with high demand and help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Spain's request for a plan of assistance would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 million in liquidity available, triple as in March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except to be, to appear".
Be brave, we can get through this!
President Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's advice requested by his sons
The storm is continuing in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge the El Enebro Judicial Council on the next 16th, which five of his seven sons will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are giving their legal standing for the new chapter of their dispute over control of a portion of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give up his dispute to be on the board of El Enebro.
He was excluded from the board of directors by five of his seven sons who had been appointed directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of that year, the objection of which is registered in the Commercial and Company Register.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16 years, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, has once again opened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The court's decision to arrange the meeting is the only mechanism for convening the meeting until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs to his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly fraudulently violating the law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the contestation of the meeting once it is held, as it is 'null in its entirety'.
The same protagonists, who keep quiet, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless claims 51% of the capital under the familiar protocols.
This is the substantive question which the judge must decide after hearing the appeal for which there is not yet a date set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options for a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the past few seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without diminishing the skill of the German champion Sebastian Vette as a driver, nor the power of the Renault engine that drives his car, the world of Formula 1 is talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during racing and testing.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now has 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can go from virtual reality to simulator reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological development madness there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula One team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty is 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put to use in its participation in the circuits are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety is zero.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in race cars accounted for 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the 20 80 to 100 square metres of retail space the multinational company plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will take this initiative into account with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the refurbished store on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero declined to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The head of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the deployment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and designs the furniture exclusively for shops (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers training of staff in the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that this was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service provided to customers and SMEs in purchasing, supporting, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pilot program that solves potential problems with HP's warranty computer equipment.
An online service connecting to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days".
"This system is designed specifically for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell's bet on stealing a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's deputy director Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
Nevertheless, it envisages a collapse in interest rates, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and in the price of the loan.
Sabadell expects to attract a million individual customers in three years, a task it must accomplish.
Sabadell found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new Master Plan in 2011 with a validity of three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use public subsidies from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new individual customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can leave the bank - its big task to be accomplished, because up to now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the individual customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 corporate customers.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it is above 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans for the global banking sector.
Sabadell will in fact finalize its Optima Master Plan this year, which it established four years ago, although the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
The main focus will be on customers who miss the savings coffers.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the crisis in Spain will be "slow to get out".
He also stressed that in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector.
And even if he thinks the war on liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and coffers pay for its issuance to get liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of the differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The management plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although as always the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
He is not in vain in assuring that in Spain "greater demands will be made".
"Everything will move next year", he assured.
He says that capital needs are "increasing tremendously" and some Spanish financial institution could enter the red numbers.
It also states that the FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the event of new recapitalisations.
After assuring Sabadell that it can survive the temporary closure of markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It says that it cannot be issued, but, contrary to what happened in June, it can be obtained in the short term through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
The ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is taking place.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Banking Confederation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been completed, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, it is adjustments".
"Most of the work has been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has also been very involved in this operation", the manager stressed.
In the declarations made during a breakfast by the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible pace and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The move from 45 funds with an average volume of 28.5 million assets to 17 with 75.5 million is a trial unprecedented in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a rather unfortunate series of opinions about the slow pace of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that the deadline must be met before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and that those who question it are "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had recovered well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which range from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the removal of the EUR 426 unemployment benefit without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It is worth mentioning that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In Germany, the three possible outcomes of the crisis are being speculated in the face of European resistance.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the Mark, even though it now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines for countries that break them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and the extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German Government devised a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought it should do (tax rigour and fiscal stability) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel barely extended the decision to save Greece.
It has since been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the press were against rescuing Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to enable a country's bailout and at the same time forcing private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and in the months to come we should be witnessing the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that even if we now have to take measures that we may not agree with too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would be over.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, where countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves to be out of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that led Spain's growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be a shame not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely shouldn't do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will bring us greater peace.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity we've been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has heard it in this way too and his twofold statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the path has been paved to the idea that order must be made at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And one of the possibilities we are considering is that we can leave a monetary zone too full of unimportant countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that it warned us.
Sport and fraud
Tricks similar to Alonso and Ramos's against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has caused much ink to be poured on the anti-sport nature of such behaviour and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, minutes before the game was over (their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, as Real Madrid will eventually lead their group, both players will be subject to the regulatory sanction during the next game of the draw against Auxerre and will be able to go without cards to the next stage.
Eventually, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and various financial amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the football world.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that this has been played by a team from the Real Madrid entity (who in their anthem showcases nobility and honour and who on past occasions has fined their players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatisation, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his long history as a histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulations, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether such actions are fraudulent; they are indeed actions which respect the rules of sport but seem to elude their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sports.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that has not been compromised by these actions, that is, there has been no violent gambling.
Another of these goods that is alluded to with proper play is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, as its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They waited and willingly accepted the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain from the deliberate errors examined.
It seems necessary to note that neither the opponent is put at a disadvantage nor the player gains an advantage in the same match, because the result of the action is obviously to leave their own team with fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on those players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next Champions League phase without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and besides that, with this action players perform a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the buildup of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder is not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which still includes the making of strategic decisions that promote maximum profit from what the rules allow.
In our case, the gamblers did not act to avoid the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud by law), but instead they chose the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the line between genius and law fraud is widespread, I think we've had a clear case of genius here.
The controversy, I think, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-deportations and because of how to pass on the director to provoke them.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive bidding to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating on an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the round table and the lottery, when December comes, the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which, because of the crisis, have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to catch the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, as businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of New Year falls on Friday) has concentrated demands on the week of 13 December, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the circumstances, they all demand battle prizes, confirms Gaietà Farràs, president of the Barcelona Restauration Gremi.
The employer's representative now can't dare predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book".
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices", he says.
The deal will work well for "those who provide quality at a good price and with good service", he added, recalling that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so the €25 tranche has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various centres in the centre found that demands had collapsed by the night of the 17th.
Soteras Group says there is a real demand boom for this Friday, claiming to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early bookings even from the beginning of November.
"We have done everything we can to keep prices the same as last year, with menus for all tastes from €19.95 to €30", they explain.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources mention that the 18th will also be a high-activity day for groups of friends who celebrate the holidays ahead of time.
They added one to their six group menus for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made using the Champagne method - Cava.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm employer (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Entertainment Association), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, believes that the end of the tunnel can be seen and says that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers are "negotiating as much as possible".
It is true that the hope for the festivities has not waned, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern for the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
The WikiLeaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that Pakistan's nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, rather than increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is a major cause of concern in Washington.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the Taliban-attacked territory, the dispersal of short-range nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia, to be proliferative and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the declining educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his US counterparts.
The new feature of the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high level of nuclear weapons production.
A message from the Embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks leader
Obama will appoint a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol has issued a red alert to track the movements and locate Assange.
All the aspects of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, this one's not new, otherwise it's dated November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest leak of over a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks's lawyer Mark Stephens says "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On 20 May the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest warrant for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organisation's explanations, consider the red notice call a freeway for arrest - which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be located.
The movement has been outraged by Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, who is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter said.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother is defending her son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are spying on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us", he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to reconsider his statements after saying Assange would have to be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something".
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with a twinkle in the eye to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the second internal revolt within the ERC, without the north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can by no means give him the headaches he had with other current blackouts.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with blinking eyes that will blind him to the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to decide on its continuation in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalty to the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and subjection to himself.
In several interviews he said he would not be considered for ratification with half plus one vote, but added, without mentioning percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand that the president do more than make his position available to the militant, a move that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the upper house of Congress.
But as they do not have a majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which management will submit for a vote by the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in return for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that polyphony affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry in the family.
In this regard, the article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considering Puigcercós' ideology, the holder of the Innovation was of the opinion that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first is to 'recompose' the executive to at least 90% of the activism, i.e. to include new figures from the Carod adept sector.
The second may be the character of big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC be liquidated once and for all as the operating mechanism.
He advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through elected delegates.
The end of the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of Puigcercós's team, which had already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion commissioned the management to revise the assembly model in a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting is still unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years has not recommended this topic.
Now, with no critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the Mexican State MILENIO, there has been a four-fold decline in cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of Mexico State.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in the Valle de México.
In the first month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca municipality.
The subject had at least three gunshots and a graft to the head, except for the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The following day, a body was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán Colony in Naucalpan Municipality.
Early Thursday morning, four owners of jointly-owned land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots in the chest on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message was found near the body, signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was shot and killed with eight rounds of ammunition as he left his home to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a gunshot wound to the head each in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the gunshot wound to the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a bullet struck by a .25 caliber firearm was found.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency services searched the rest of the body but they couldn't find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán have warned of the discovery of a body in Peña Colorada, with hands tied behind and blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been executed in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Uncorrectable.
On 17th, two women were found wrapped in blankets in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca municipality and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, identified in principle as Mario Ríos, in accordance with a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's dead body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
The woman's skin was marked with Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, a man's body was found by a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with wrinkled heads and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with their hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
The officers found a bristol near him with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of this country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, representing China at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its coal footprint and re-convert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country has spent $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognises the targets discussed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the government and local authorities to achieve the energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multiannual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps to cost-effective lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar one by 2020, he said.
Espinos legal expulsion from the city: Cesar Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is lawful.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo took office as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission of Sonora".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal, if necessary, by making a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body,' he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the Acción Nacional would be stronger after the next December 4 and 5 internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been a successful and targeted approach to local elections", he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; rather, we enjoy it and it makes us stronger", he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to choose the best leader needed by the Acción Nacional for the next three years, so he would give the job "to the person determined by the council".
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's revival in the July 4 election would be reflected in the next debate, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012".
"For the moment, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and a reason for observation throughout the country, so there has been "a lot of hope in this regard, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón, let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet", he said.
He said the head of the federal executive can make phrases like the ones he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag in the country, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve the legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize student paperlessness, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve the legislation", Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps a cyber link open with a broader document urging the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope will soon be held, now is the time to listen to your voice", he said.
The message was leaked after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding extension continues.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have plenty of time... "
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year"...
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would seek a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, even if it's most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 youth who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the project's supporters are the protagonists of intense lobbying to secure the passage of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most coveted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his stance.
Even though the House has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature, we put our finger on the wound.
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk where participants presented the narrative
"Sex in language, I understand, but... finger on wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in Language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"...shame us", the Argentine writer gently launched to the public, mostly young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to find out what the "plague" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
She came out of the infectious disease clinic convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the trauma doctor who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explained that wound is not a scientific term; the psychoanalyst revealed the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is the one that is actually open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of language must be closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also told a fascinating story called "Elohe de la invención", where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he talks about a famous sorceress who touched clouds, turned people back who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that then turns to talk about America, the great news that had its own chroniclers from the beginning and quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narrations of the conquering captains.
"The inventor of all of us (the writers) mocked false witnesses who appeared in stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty".
Nevertheless, he stressed, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It is through his legacy that we are what we are".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations brought about by the invitation of the FIL with her round table The debt on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman has raised her voice over the great scourge of social violence her country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - which is causing drug trafficking and drug sales disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated", she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a 'chemical reaction' of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it is due to the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that is also rapidly changing in intellectual habits and conscience control, and that dogmatism is in its favor, "behind every affirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers that prefer a world in black and white", he said, urging to recover the sense of writing.
Romano on his first title hunt
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals he has had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach the deciding series three times.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that compete, marked by their technicians, who find a marked contrast between them by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has managed to reach the deciding series three times, even though so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up getting a consolation with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santer strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with whom he lost 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall score of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered another setback as his team made a 2-2 draw against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he gained a 3-1 lead with two chances to win the title and finally three of his players missed 11 yards and he suffered the jump to a 4-3 result.
Rubén has lost two finals to the Diablos Rojos and one to Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the curse so he can celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important", the captain commented when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers the final very well, from which he says he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not a concern for him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the penalties series, we try to finish within the regular time limit, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared for, unfortunately fate has turned us around, sometimes it's the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands we missed, this served as a lesson for this final and we hope we don't get into that situation again".
Romano now has the opportunity to stop being a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory that titles offer.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service before their interview in the Consular Section; the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassies and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide certain benefits for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay for an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not be required to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who wish to have a second interview in the Consular Section will stay there less than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the extra service fee of $26 USD.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press as saying it will present tomorrow a discovery that will impact the search for living things in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
NASA said in a press release that it would present "who will impact the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put the possibility on the table of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that a microbe was discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, and it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any life form, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that don't have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, the use of arsenic in their metabolism proves that "there is another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), with the view that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
The Commission has also examined the possible possible possible use of the aid in the form of a loan.
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, they say.
The 60th had just begun when an opposition bloc appeared in Congress led by the MPs from PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the opening session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo were "telling" against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are starting the 'bipartisan' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms constitute institutional marginalization on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme based on a political will and if they do not have it, they will be again enslaved by both parties and thus the opposition coalition will end.
"Until now (the opposition coalition) has come, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
He continued that Congress cannot be allowed to become a "duopolist" after being monopolistic.
"It is not in the spirit of law reform that there should be a bipartisan Congress forever".
The convergent group has started with five legislators and is now talking to other colleagues to increase their number.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'booty' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Once there was only one party, now they divide it in two".
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the member's personality and to give him his seat at the negotiating table.
"They will not leave out five, who will probably be nine deputies, now the five that we see, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform".
$200 million more for the supplier
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company in question.
Another cheque of some 200 thousand pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in the second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this latest check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, as a "supplier account liquidation" concept.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Audit Office to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, cheque packages will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We bought nothing, we just paid him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, as provided for by the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25th, Northeast had published a review of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 and July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks worth over 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites must be maintained
Tourist contractors regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions at the Sánchez Taboada Roundpoint in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a ditch in the Sánchez Taboada roundpoint, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants' Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be cleaned up and new activities should replace those that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk around and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don't know how much money you lose, elsewhere they haven't done the work for so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The mayor will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just do the corrective", he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live, and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city clean".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because tourists come, it's not just about promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"They have not received the proper attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is well known to all, that maintenance is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not being used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must come together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to our inventory to promote this destination".
IP is asking for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, CCE president, proposed that the members of the House of Representatives take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatlán's business sector is calling for a dignified and free-of-agreement working legislature between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is in turmoil and facing major problems.
The 60th Parliament was convened yesterday by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and one from the PVEM, a total of 40 people's representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress have is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, CCE president, proposed that the members of the House of Representatives take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the members of the House will really exercise their right, free from party agreements, because it is customary for them to make pacts to protect their own interests and to turn themselves into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
I therefore ask them to certify their commitment to building the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and committed job with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is to push and add forces in the pursuit of economic growth in the state, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job generation".
As regards tourism, he asked the new legislatures to give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I have come to understand that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruent as a major economic activity and generator of currency and investment and that it competes directly with the agribusiness".
Apart from the fact that resources must be allocated to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a magic king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and one goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel are not losing hope that Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on a daily basis because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband has no work, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'people' to sell on the street", says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the children's mother.
Adelaide, four, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, three, wants a Barbie doll.
Jose Alfredo, 10, has long wanted a monster truck, and Cayetana suggests a year's worth of clothes for his 8-month-old brother Jesús.
"He (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like to have this monster,' but I said 'we'll see, my son,' because he was very dear", recalls Cayetana sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, has a height of 12 feet; Isaías, 10, a height of 10, and Miguel, 8, a height of 8.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of athletic shoes, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six-and-a-half-size shoes would be a great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign We're Looking for a Magic King, by donating a toy or money to the Northwest reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Around a dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The search was carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in areas where drugs were allegedly produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Police.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The search was the result of a long investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Quebec Police Service's Regional Investigative Unit, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regiment took part in this police operation.
The illegal migration will continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should address the problem of illegal migrant boats, is likely to be defeated, as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be held for up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong people.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", said Mr Duceppe.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that measures should be taken against smugglers and we are doing so through another bill, C-35", Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for at least a year", Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling members of Parliament that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown".
"They expect Canada to take firm action", Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it were rejected.
A Conservative told the QMI Agency, however, that the government would ask for a vote for every MP who opposes to speak to his constituents.
The new unity does not lead to unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry into the matter.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea is not new: Quebec reportedly consulted the New York Department of Investigation about this as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent corruption unit since 1870.
But Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be noted that at a meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services of Quebec on 29 October this year, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pakistani public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron to describe the announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a slammed-down solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it", he says.
"We're aware of that problem".
The CSQ President, Réjean Parent, said that nothing could replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General", he said.
It also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thereby enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor for Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in such investigations is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague in the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which targeted motorcycle gangs, 131 people were arrested despite the lack of a criminal code.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangster Law.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under heavy surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preemptively.
In the evening another slide was reported in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has fallen.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 millimeters fell in several areas.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and the Ottawa Valley were the hardest hit.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since this precipitation is added to the snow melting that has already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear that several rivers will overflow.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Safety for the Ouareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and the Châne, in Lotbinière, were flooded and kept under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused flooding of some lakes, including St. Julian, St. Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was moved due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Ottawa, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, including in the towns of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on high alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre issued a flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, including the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont was partially dismissed by the Canadian Council for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for controversial comments about social assistance and Haitians as well as his gross language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not appropriate for broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the release of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Social Assistance Joint Front.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The presenters should present sound information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont midi' have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner".
So no blame was held against him.
The last case was on statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been engaged in a face-to-face media conversation that had generated a lot of reaction.
The CHOI host said he had not donated anything to help Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the people in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this".
"My record has been blank for a year and a half", said the host.
In all its decisions, the Committee condemns the spread of gross language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond its obligation'.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, inter alia, have to announce these decisions once during broadcast hours within three days.
A Kung Fu King in Montreal
Montreal native Nacereddine Zemmal has a very special journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing, and Thai boxing climbs the world's tatami and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explains Zemmal, who has lived in the city since 2008 to become a professional".
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America".
Recently, the UPS security guard and commissioner delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the World Cup of San Shou".
"Fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championships in each category were invited".
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto".
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, while in Toronto in 2009, I came third", he added.
"The interesting thing is I've made progress in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San shou or Sanda is a Chinese discipline where punching and kicking, as well as throwing projections on the ground, are allowed.
Duels are originally played on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous wrestler to emerge from this form of combat is Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will certainly be able to attend the King of Sanda Super Tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This is the most prestigious and prestigious competition in China", explained the friendly cheerleader.
"It's a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his 80 kg class, before losing in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semifinal winners will face each other in the final of their category".
"Then the winners of each category face off to crown one champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this flood of more than 100 contracts was a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor which obtained the largest, project management, for a sum of $295 million without tender.
The consortium, called Énergie Gérrance, was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the energy management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's the new way to collusion and to knock down competition".
"That is, people, instead of doing this in secret, are now doing it openly", said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Mr Simard raised the question in the National Assembly earlier this morning because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied this afternoon, strongly denying any collusion in the contract.
"I'm starting to get my trip", she said, claiming that the PQ had been "unfair" and "unreasonable".
She said that "it would be the least of it" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited partnership which allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is highly complex given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is expected to be completed in stages until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition playing a role; there was negotiation.
The consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is under investigation by the government.
A quick review of the Quebec business register has led to the listing of more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau thus works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Geneva, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
As regards the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay area responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded to this in a particular way since the 1970s".
The chief executive of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract was awarded voluntarily.
"If you go to the bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher".
"You have two choices: either you take the people in that market and you say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and a good price.' "
"But the point is that it is not the price that matters, it is the competence of the people", said Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following an audit, Le D devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Geneva 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energie Gerenzi.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 management energy contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has also pointed out that the PQ is linked to the firms that "fund" it, before clarifying that they were its leaders.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and green certifications to guide his choices.
The report also highlights the importance of the European Union's role in the fight against drug trafficking and the need to promote the free movement of people.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of respondents said they did not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they did in the green advertising of companies, according to the measurement tool developed by the responsible Consumer Observatory at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications for so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are proven to be environmentally responsible, says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the political discourse on this topic seriously.
However, information on responsible consumption appears essential to stimulate this sector of consumption currently enjoyed by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
The vacuum and doubtfulness of the information would calm the burning hearts of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake detected by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, one third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being offered to them.
On another note, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
61% also favored purchases from local merchants and preferred the purchase of food grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by being concerned about animal protection.
But his social and environmental conscience seems to be outside his car, says the Barometer. In 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or advocated co-driving to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large behavioural survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A State loan to buy back eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agreed to cooperate, but only on a loan.
The Angus Development Company and the Parallel, which had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy the eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard from Daniel Langlois to restore it to its full filmmaking vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on favourable terms, at least according to sources from the Government offices.
A preliminary action plan and an application for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is the pilot for the eXcentris dossier.
He got her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The parallel and Angus have until December 31 to answer.
However, it seems that the assumption of state donation must really be dismissed.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinéma et de parc du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders in the community were demanding substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the canyons, spent ten years running the author's cinema in his premises at the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify a waiver from the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie theaters was a major problem in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its customer base.
Angus and the Parallels, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are also launching a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to help drive the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, has continued to stream films on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on 27 February next year by showing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled The Devoir and we don't know what he and his group think about the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks cover up what the US sees as the complex inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but they also betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
So American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn't have the Canada-US relationship in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government get its 2009 budget passed!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were posted on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to be ignored.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of a federal election campaign, shows how far the United States is not a part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than to blame this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
The United States is thus, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in the election: ubiquitous but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote".
Another expression of this sense of importance is found in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, the business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government survives the confidence vote in the federal budget in early February, when Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade from a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus plan", Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed resumption plan.
Another communication, signed by Ambassador Wilkins in January 2008, warned Washington of the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series on CBC from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows, which show subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's muscular interrogation abductions.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kushner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent".
"The secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, it is worth noting that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He got the echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to refurbish lighting
The UN proposed a plan in Cancun to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows the major concrete projects the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still hold 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent light bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (DEL or "LED") bulbs, the majority of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70 percent of the emissions from the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will take another 5 Gt to stabilize the climatic rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5 percent is produced by light.
With fluoro-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by a further twofold.
Fluocompetent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - which was also a part of the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent lamps because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place directives.
But the report says that the world's main source of mercury emissions is not the fluorescent bulb but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the waste electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion dollars to build.
Ivory Coast looks forward to announcing election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election to be published "within time" after the deadline expires.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
It called on all Ivorian parties and institutions to take responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has delayed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About 40 minutes before the deadline expired, the chairman of the IEC had said on television that the Commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls were raised on Wednesday for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivorian president, said the FN's campaign intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are withheld by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection to the former rebels, deemed the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from publishing the results.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the top spot in the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% in the overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonal adjustment data (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area is 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan areas and 9.7% with the OCTs.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the MDCs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the ILO.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 points over three months and one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 years and over, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49 year olds enjoyed unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so, and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini questioned and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was tried and hanged at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, embezzlement, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and is eager to explain himself on all the questions the judge will ask him, not fantasies".
"It's easy to prosecute a multitude of wrongful bosses, but it's another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, the brother of the PS strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had to send a memo to the judge before the hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also questioned Wednesday night and beheaded.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to handle.
Mr Simon said he had never been aware of the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds for their operation.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Municipality's services, was tried on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, and released under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation for the facts that are being accused of him".
"The magistrate-in-court took this into account and did not deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were arrested and released on Tuesday night and two were placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness in Marseille Provence Metropolis (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne municipality, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being tried on one charge of "abduction and misappropriation of public property by a public service person", and the other one for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was put on trial for "abusing social property".
Among the people confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from the big band.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several legal information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous emails, for alleged fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
The investigation, from a source close to the investigation, focuses in particular on the conditions for allocating and operating a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and certain towns in the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept public opinion in France on the edge, alerted diplomacy, and intensified the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the US diplomats.
US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underlying causes of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France wanted by the US judiciary for trafficking materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a raw light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée's strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are speaking with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "make noise, keep on hammering" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
We need it to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it, especially since the Iranians ask you not to".
Because, after trying to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not fix anything", Iranians are "masters in delayed maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss's release from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 000 euros in bail).
And he says that the Elysee anticipates further hostage crisis, a phenomenon that will "get worse".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future", he said.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains trapped in Iran.
Information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States is demanding extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris on a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons acquisition networks, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French woman?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
Elisha, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" surveillance by the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composes a phone number, hangs up, and informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysee did not spare its efforts, through press releases and organized "leaks", to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation is fruitful since several newspaper articles are reproducing the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 referred to "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
The embassy in Paris is asking why so much "gratitude" is expressed to Mr Assad.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The paper then examines the reasons why the Elysee was cast into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008 that "was then perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and unwarranted".
By "exaggerating the role of Syria", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria the praise it can gain by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"It should at least create confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrymen".
No online games for Korean youths past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be tabled in Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to online games after midnight for children under 16, said representatives from the Ministries of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and living a normal daytime life".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
He said companies would have one year to prepare for law enforcement.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access to these games for young people whose parents request them, the official added.
It will also make free software available to people who ask for it, which will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various facts about heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of a wave of corruption suspicions, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday designated the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying could take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen's Competition will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the figures who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
The backstage talks may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which was the source of the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, may have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, having hosted the World Cup only once in 1966.
The BBC gave a new layer of coverage on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that puts three influential members of the EC together, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
It would be a disgrace to FIFA and embarrass British officials who have been lobbying heavily in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-publish the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to reinforce England's standing before the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in assets with its already ready-made stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weighted outsider despite the shortcomings in its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled reference to the accusations of the English press against the EC members.
"We're covering them with mud, we're trying to compromise them", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, stronger than the 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favourite.
The world's leading economic powerhouse, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications seem premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA-appointed 2026 World Cup to China, which would effectively make Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which has come out with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new territories, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it seem he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
One mandate in the Elysee calls another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously, the president's job is not a good one.
Then you have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even though they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said with a serious tone that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President was merely reminding us that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you've got seven and a half years left with me", he told them in July 2009.
Rebelot in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step".
His words before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they're making comments, there are two reasons.
The acceleration of the PS race, on the one hand.
But it's not the entry of Ségolène Royal that makes Nicolas Sarkozy come forward.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many in the PS are demanding an earlier battle order than expected.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he thinks defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who is obviously resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to specify the way out of the crisis or at least to announce the end of many unconventional monetary policy operations due to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is making it impossible for the Frankfurt Emissions Institute to be so peremptory as to worsen the current tense situation on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
At a press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, praised the ECB's active role in solving the European debt crisis.
It did not say whether it felt the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners . . ".
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, at his hearing in Brussels the day before yesterday by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, did not express his intentions, but simply stated that the secondary market purchasing programme was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at Thursday's meeting.
The ECB will keep its main key rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it reportedly made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the euro system have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Marketers are unquestionably expecting further purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a marked change in direction.
While the ECB's arsenal of loans of more than three months has already disappeared, it still provides unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule significantly".
"Otherwise, it would be risking further short-term tensions", says Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm not going to say.
As regards its intervention in the public debt market, 'the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to drive a smooth market', adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposures of European banks to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the yields paid by the most fragile states from being stacked up", said a senior bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates rise, the countries will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt if not stabilize it.
The saving of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back on the
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has eased somewhat yesterday, with the decline in bond rates to 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unbreakable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain uptick in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Mr Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "strong concern" about "turbulence in the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and the associated decline in tax revenue, which means that the state is at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still represent 4,3% of GDP next year (compared to the government's 3,9% forecast) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
The Commission has therefore been rumoured to have set up a new budgetary collective after the holidays, worth 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken", said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time", said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate, short or long-term problem, because despite its large debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a time when decisions would be unsuitable in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde also pointed out this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe we have shown again on Sunday night and day, are obviously solidarity, determination, and commitment to defend their currency and their currency zone".
Although relative, the relaxation of EU government bond rates yesterday brought water to the government and ECB mill.
But we can't talk about a start to standardization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly affects banking systems", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
This is especially true since "political time is much slower than market time".
The European countries, aware of this gap and the dangers it entails, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also the case for the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings beginning next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The menu shows the fate of the non-conventional measures in support of the euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform far-eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly sets the stage for them.
The first issues of ESF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds raised through an additional direct IMF commitment.
The leading countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to closer-effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before they have implemented their own budgetary corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European lenders are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
When visiting Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros raised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get its hands on the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of some EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injections.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has so far provided €60 billion.
A Council which has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions were to worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snow events continue to cause traffic problems, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the northern Gironde and Charente Islands and slight snowfall is occurring on Île-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm at a time, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow events are notable enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côte d'Armor, several departments have been banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only when necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned in Picardy for Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the coming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The Paris Metro: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been raging, billions have fallen.
At least in the discussion.
The Commission has also proposed a new proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop from the markets.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which was discussed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the origin of this money.
The two are the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, Article 15 of the draft law states, is 'for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It is calculated: "The income from this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganization of an existing office tax "to modernise it, increase its output and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that yield?
It's a mystery.
It's not in the text.
We're a long way from four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the €4 billion of capital allocation which will be mobilised by the State and contributed to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", the statement of reasons reads.
At the GSP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (the two taxes, etc.), we can cover three years of study and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards", it explains.
"It will be entered in the budget and drawn up as it passes".
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still absent subscribers, could cause a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers Avengers and Diligent Spy
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is a clear scandal, a scandal which is only seen as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those Berlusconi owns), and the sinister caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been a subject of sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new information already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will find that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in earlier books.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (or does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only in what they already know, and it confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
I'll go to the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, I know, a Freedmen's editor) is lazy (or of a limited mind), and he only keeps what he admits to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why were the revelations on these files so loud?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person knows already, that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or fly to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representative exercises, have become spy centres.
Any investigative film viewer knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, publicly repeating it violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a major blow to the State Department's prestige.
The scandal therefore does not put victims in crisis as much as the "borrowers".
But let's get to the bottom of what happened.
Back in Orwell's day, we could imagine all power as a Big Brother controlling every move of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had come true in full since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when we show, as it happens now, that even the crypts of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has said before, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all her power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - it would be like posting it on a street corner poster.
But it is just as obvious that with modern technology, there is no hope of keeping confidential communications on the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew around and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved relations be maintained in the future ?
I know that my prediction is science fiction at the moment and is therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligences on uncontrollable routes, carrying only memorized messages or, at best, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copies in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing crabbily, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored the wireless telegraph.
The analogue videotapes allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and uncovering all the secrets of editing, whereas the digital CDs now only allow for chapter-by-chapter leaps, i.e. by macroportions.
High-speed trains take three hours from Rome to Milan, while air travel takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that the politics and communication techniques are the same as those of horse-drawn carriages.
One last thought.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now it's the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France is distorting its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the implementation of the promises of rapidly unblocked financing (so-called fast start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French puzzles are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (or 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played a big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a big side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated for its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announced that it had committed €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
The Copenhagen agreement requires that this money be 'new and additional' to ensure that additional efforts are made without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditure or to the overall level of State aid for development.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease) and it claims to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that a euro borrowed is equal to a given euro.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is incomparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that rely on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro to be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted against its commitments.
But France has only to reason with this: it is "respecting" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so heavily.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other countries) fulfil their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts in 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts in only 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
That's a nice passing game.
In summary, in its fast start financing, France is conducting a double fraud: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and on the other, on the reality of the financial effort.
With only €36.1 million, it can make it appear that it is spending €420 million on 'new and additional' projects in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has arbitrated) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to lend if they only lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term matter compared with all the climate discussions.
But there could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of 'additionality' or the way loans are accounted for will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning against pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Future Generations (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significance in view of the small number of samples analysed but are illustrative of the problem", purchased between July and September the food normally consumed in four meals and one snack in a day by a ten-year-old child in supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sweets, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as certain carcinogens and 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our survey shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern", notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven carcinogens and nearly 20 residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which the study envisaged as a container, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide that is banned in France.
The same is true for the Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, which the study found traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the cut steak, canned tuna, and even the breadstick and chewing gum were infused with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water was tested for nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even examining the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of these "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The European Ecology-Green Alliance (EE-LV) proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the rise of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
