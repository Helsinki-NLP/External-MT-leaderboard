We wear uniforms at our school.
Sami got a call from Fred's daughter.
His memory amazes me.
I have a message for you.
Did you manage to convince Faisal?
I'm talking about him.
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.
She's the axel I know.
Can I go with him?
He's moving forward.
Lila was giving Sunday school lessons.
Sami gave more medicine to Layla.
She loves Tom.
The town grew into a city.
My mom worked hard to raise us .
I was silent for a long time.
Take your home home.
She committed suicide.

Swimming is forbidden.
It was in Sami's office on a couch.
It sounded crazy.
Sami sat in front of Layla.
Sami returned to Egypt.
It's hard for me as a doctor to say that about another doctor, but that's the truth.
I have a long nose.
Sami is upset.
Sammy hit Layla and she passed out.
All the teachers were here.
That's her shoe.
When the wind blows, the candle goes out.
Sami has made a decision and no one can force him to give up.
It's a fake.
Don't you remember him?
Tom is waiting for a response.
The sun's rays covered the hills.
Sami was subject to eternal judgment.
He speaks English but German.
I can send you my Amazigh dictionary.
Tom doesn't sing anymore.
That's the dumbest thing I ever said.
Faisal joined a public university in Philadelphia.
We have no choice but to follow.
Can you suggest a good place to eat Korean food?

Raise the Edo.
Sit down at the table.
I'm going to save you all.
I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't my teacher.
Tom runs too fast.
I'm from Australia.
We know the sun is bigger than the earth.
I don't feel good today.
Actually, that's why I'm here.
Thanks for coming.
Go help your brother!
She didn't come because her boyfriend didn't come.
I'm just laughing.
How am I gonna pay my debts now?
Light the candle.
Give the book to whoever wants it.
We finally got to the lake.
Sami is the clinic manager.
Sammy knows.
Lila went to college.
He's like me.
I like to eat watermelon.
I had a teacher with a psychotic nervousness.
Tom couldn't help but cry.
Can I help you?
Everyone is confused.
Jim's learning to drive.
What a beautiful child.
Fifty-two percent of British women prefer chocolate to sex.
I can jump.
Are these your dogs?
The hooves are the worst enemy of birds in New Zealand.
The rest is up to you!
Tom was alone in the house.
The first lesson is easy.
I hit him with a pen.
Sami was taking the dog out for a walk.
Brannia surprised me.
He was a righteous street man.
What is Tom's car?
Most of the paper fell.
The hospital opened last month.
Sami had a listening device under his clothes.
My past is on him.
I have your diary.
Fadel turned the door handle quietly and entered the house.
Sami shook that tree.
They're talking about this and that.
I have an Italian neighbor.
Sami went on vacation.
Give your diary a hand.
I'm gonna shoot him.
Where was Tom born?
Israel knows what it's gonna do in the West Bank, but it doesn't seem to know what it's gonna do in Gaza.
She's holding something.
I go to school by bus.
It's not working.
Sami wanted to make Lila love him.
Here 's the book .
Sami comes closer.
"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
The Japanese love to travel as a group.
Wait for me in my office.
I know what you mean.
We 're just talking .
Let's take a look.
You're standing in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue jacket.
The police collected a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter where it came from.
What do you think you're doing?
You got me?
It's my fault.
Tom likes to go out.
Sami's fate is in the hands of the jury.
Nancy looked like she was totally exhausted.
You can waste ten logs.
Just 15 minutes.
This is the window that broke.
Little Tom with a brown puddle on Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What did you study at university?
Don't say anything before you think about it.
No one believed his story.
He was hit by a car.
The moon and the star are symbols of Islam.

Jamie, you don't have time to worry about Important!
Dima nodded and said, "I get it, sorry to bother you, then. Enjoy the Vanta.
Let's split the expenses.
I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sammy's car crashed into a bus stop.
I have a cat and a dog.
Layla will be brought to justice.
As in heaven, so on earth.
Edder is my favorite amygdala singer.
Did the cat eat your tongue?
I yelled at the teacher.
See you in the distance.
What does the word "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.
"But don't you think it's a little big?"
Why are you so rude?
Layla left Sammy.
I only have half of his books.
Sammy was in the next room.
You're dating a student from Keio, aren't you?
It looks very good.
I'm not going to tell you.
Would you go swimming naked?
Sami was circumcised at the age of six.
Mom cut the cake.
Sami asked God to help him.
I have a good job now.
Is anyone watching?
Thank you so much, Doctor.
I have to tell Jamal what I heard.
I have no excuse.
She 's become rich .
I'll do my best not to disturb you while you study.
You have to go back.
Say the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills, let him believe, and whoever wills, let him disbelieve.
Sami has diminished Lila's respect.
Fadl knew the police could be here any minute.
Where's the British Embassy?
Sorry I didn't answer you earlier.
Is this dog biting?
A club of virtue, Dania.
Sami was serving a life sentence.
She put the magazine on the table.
Sammy called Billy, asked her to come and take him.
Sami never feels comfortable.
Sami offered to tell the police everything he knew.
How far is the park from your house?
This is my house.
Thanks for the tip.
Let's get ready to go.
Sami looked down.

A drug trafficker was arrested at the airport.
Did you see that, honey?
I use Twitter.
Give me your ID card, please.

When did the meeting end?
The thick fog makes it hard to see the road.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It wasn't her!
He told me not to touch me.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Lila.
I better ask her.
Mariko speaks English fluently.
I don't care what other people say.
Tom didn't want to dance with Mary.
What about you?
This is not a white candle.
Yesterday was my birthday.
She talks like she knows everything about him.
Sami was an ambulance worker.
Sami killed a whore.
She likes oranges.
You dive in and the predatory fish will eat you.
Why is the sky blue?
I'm late because of the traffic.
She accused me of lying.
Who's supposed to welcome Palestinians to the West Bank and Gaza if they're expelled?
I'm taking you home.
He expressed his grief.
She looked around.
You changed Sammy's life forever.
It's too big.
It's an Arab virtue.
Her eyes are blue.
We're celebrating the birth of Lila.

He asked, "What do you mean?" But he boasted, because if he had remained silent, this sentence would have been too simple.
I tried to get Charles to help me, but he didn't.

We ate a whole shipment of apples.
The grass needs to be reed.
Show me how it works.
Anyway, that's not the important thing.
May I ask, where are you going?
It's Tom's Turtle. Her name is Mary.
I hope summer never ends.
Sami wanted you to give Layla more money.
Do you know English?
Sami has no right to do that.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of her car.
Sami was confined to a hospital bed.
I'm glad to hear your voice.
Layla joined a new Nazi camp.
Open the door.
Sami was a resident at a local hospital.
What a poor flower.

I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Wait Sammy for six weeks.
Sami's videos on YouTube have been deleted.
This game sounds kind of dangerous.
I'm getting cold.
Good always wins.
Nancy smiled happily.
Tom answered the call.

What are you waiting for?
I'll give him the car on the right.
Stress can have a major negative impact on your health.
Why would we want to do that?

I love listening to music with you.
Keep walking for a while.
Sami understood this.
What do you like to eat?
Is that your sister?
Sami borrowed a car from Lila.
I want to buy you a present.
Sami tried to escape justice.
Sami turned himself in to the police.
Where will I live?
Is that your car?
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
I wasn't alone.
That idea doesn't make sense.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
They went to a fancy restaurant for dinner.

A cat came out of under the desk.
I understand your language.
You might have to fire her.
He's got five fingers.
We can't wait for dinner.
I'm not swimming in this lake.
Not every question is worth answering.
Sami was confused.
Who stole the apple?
I'm sure he succeeds.
Did you talk to me?
We are facing a huge crisis.
