Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy with the need to combat electoral falsifications.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of electoral falsifications in the United States are more rare than cases of lightning deaths.
In addition, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States over a decade.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the voter presence.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That’s why most state governments have since 2009 passed laws that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained a new scale after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of the will statement and take away the right to vote from citizens who have a conviction.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present an ID card with a photo.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present ID cards with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the voting age requirement, do not have a photo identity card issued by their state government agency.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that is not all.
Students — voters who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats — in several states are not allowed to use a photo identity card issued by their school.
However, these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the campaign to register voters helped to list about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
During the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of early voters were African Americans, although the latter made up only 13% of the state’s total voters.
The same thing happened with people from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who formed 76% of the voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the U.S. Attorney General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID card.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats have condemned the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing them as clearly aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represented 171 out of the 270 votes needed in the college of electors to win the presidential election.
It is still too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is undoubted: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter presence.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: to take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false results, false negative, and sometimes false positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing dispensation, have something to doubt even more.
Testing or not?
I asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, numerous cases of infection were observed among the subjects, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different rates of mortality in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastases was 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting at 50, or at 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more often we are precisely defining the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
So I would recommend going through the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to undergo this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows you to evaluate all the for and against passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite scientific progress, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of illness.
It is believed that if all people eat well and exercise enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If nobody smoked anymore, this figure would have risen to at least 50 percent,” said Andre Boley, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, fighting smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous harm to human health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman Andre Boley.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association adds.
Eating
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Cabbage products should also be avoided.
Conserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
At the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies have given contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The assessment of the impact of vitamin D on cancer development is also not completely clear.
However, Mr Boljo emphasizes that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
“A test does not lead to cancer.”
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the news that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a real upset — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted in the Standard Model — our best, or at least the “less perfect” description of the nature and behavior of matter — but which was previously unable to be detected by experimental means.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that it is precisely about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet sufficient for complete certainty.
Let’s imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to bypass this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
But although elementary particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli Exception Principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" lies, in general, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens called the Fermions who prudently obey the Paulie Principle.
In another, the bosons, a disgusting gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything—at least for this principle, which means that they can rest in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force", through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which in some way belongs the Higgs boson.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is due to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “light particle,” which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disturbs” the electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" a electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "power carriers" bosons.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one in operation at CERN – the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – is needed to such enormous energies.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold onto the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photons, by the way) do not have it.
So what can all these studies “bring,” Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to perceive the discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, some of them are passionate about the discrepancy, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to “new physics” and shut down some of the Model’s holes.
The latter, it should be said, still has substantial shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or dark matter that makes up about 80% of the universe (oh!).
However, such differences have not yet been found in CERN.
consequences
The benefit of these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s laboratories could not even guess what revolution their work would bring.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Laboratories, where laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered rather a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine it...
In addition, an application can be found for the instrument accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose at all, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that anything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die.
The Commission for the Dignity of Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon, and at this time the bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
The debt tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the palliative care shelter of Victor-Gadboa in Beloi, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at the table where there is an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to take food.
He gets alive, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, take him to the bath.
Courage before the ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this illness.
“Over the course of life, we are taught that a man should urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadboa Shelter.
Regressing to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to accept decline,” he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events happen at the height of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor Gadbuya palliative shelter are all sick with cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides the help called “treatment.”
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying “conscious of suffocation.”
But the illness allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything more in life,” she says before allowing her to put on a breath-enhancing mask.
She is still waiting for her son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadboa Shelter with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and nutritional assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants there is one place in palliative care institutions.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the shelter doctors.
Whether it is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
We will agree to give the dying a mouthwash of brandy or pepsi, depending on what he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. X, who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the feet of the deceased.
“We help our loved ones as well as our patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor Gadboa, no day is like the previous one.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, laying on his pillows during a toast in his honour, a 36-year-old young man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and has tried everything to survive.
“Over the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbuya shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbuya Refuge and the Great Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, are more or less exclusively specialized in caring for cancer patients.
It is this huge gap in Quebec’s health care system that makes many palliative care practitioners fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Starting in October, a manifesto signed by the lighthouses in palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Liapuant has been circulating, testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I’m afraid that patients want to die just because they don’t get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hope of survival for Ellen Richard was already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
No full care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team relieved their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsi Monroe, director of palliative care at the Great Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to be easier.”
This reporting was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about the colossal “system” that rocks the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
“Industry,” which cost Quebec’s taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how this system collapses after all the resources have been used,” jokes Jacques Duchamp, a MP and a former police chief in Montreal.
It was thanks to him that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a side result of an investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the prime minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Sharé, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchamp Report found a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” he said, “if some had restrained their instincts from taking the share.”
The Charbonne Commission “has already removed two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will be able to “unlock the schemes behind individual individuals.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Molot", who after 2009 forced the "stock cartel" of Montreal, to stop overpricing the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the last few weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In the line is Gilles Vaillancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribery when placing government orders.
In addition, official charges have been filed against several engineers of Montreal’s transportation services and Italian-born construction contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of receiving government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal to some type of intermediary linked to the mafia, which in turn transferred money to the United Montreal party of Mayor Gerald Trumpble.
In the 2000s, Zambito swallowed money to the right and to the left.He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various province parties, mostly the liberals who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Canalization contracts in which the cost was exaggerated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and bribery in total for $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the cost of which he overpriced.
Other officials in charge of road construction have admitted that they have been paying off their bills by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one organizer from the mayor’s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to alarm.
Mayor of the Riviera de Prairie county in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and sold over for ... 1.6 million to builders in the midst of the construction boom.
70% of Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she will "pull the thread to understand the functioning of the ants-burning system to stop the gangrene and identify the culprits."
She describes this process as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and an observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchamp notes that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about this scheme” but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to the parties to $100, but he said this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit electoral spending, politics will be dirty money.”
He calls for a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party financing: “We can’t go lower; with a bold insight into the essence of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story throws a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchamp urges those who laugh to look into their own courtyard.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season you have achieved an extraordinary scale in the PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of the PSG.
Great players arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
During the game, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I am not burning.
From the very beginning at the NIF Pre-Training Center in Clerfontein until my arrival in Saint-Etienne, I was always moving forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition set by Carlo Ancelotti.
Complement this summer is not a novelty to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be at the level and get the most out.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is supported by supporters like Claude McKellen, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
of course .
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equals and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I got away from a whole series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified to the eighth finals.
What is the club’s goal in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Everything can be from now on.
We will be able to speak face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, in order to have the opportunity to take a retaliatory match in one of the eight finals.
Can the PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
Today is not so.
Financially, the PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the Premier League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship title.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite having strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fighting for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much we’ve invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win home 4-0 against Troy and we still find something to criticize, of course, it’s a bit upset.
We ask ourselves what people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet the challenges of today.
Look at Manchester United, which hasn’t been able to get into the eighth finals for two seasons, even though they’ve also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we presented you with 15 points ahead already to the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that in spite of all the difficulties, in the end we won.
PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say that there is some “gold dependency.”
That just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves he’s a Premier League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a world-class star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending a little time playing.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out stronger.
I can play good selective matches today.
That’s what I had hoped for since I was baptized with the Blue.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Descham’s first months at the head of the Blue?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the selection group for the world championship.
He’s a strict coach, he’s close to the players and inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc?
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring the Blue to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) dropped on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This game gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there have been no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks – with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current exchange of money, based on central banks, numbered transactions between recipient parties c commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a nickname), is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of sites accept bitcoin for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin, which reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as “credits” used to promote in a video game that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are simultaneously bookholders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction really exist in a public billboard dispatched across the network.
The key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which the solver, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the phase of file hashing, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inseparably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If for the purpose of cheating a user would very quickly (in less than ten minutes) want to pay twice with the same subject money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into one hundred million, leaving a reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase of computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not affect the protocol itself," says Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billboard and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The “giant sales” were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouza, another author of the tutorial on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which thus comes out cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Nouza said, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB proposes, by the way, to review the various risks that are now considered to be increased in the event of the system’s success.
We left Afghanistan.
What next ?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and the US should follow them by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not hoping only on us.
We suffered mostly Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, and Tajik.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be there once the West becomes more sensitive.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nizhrab base, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French loans, went well.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Their taking of control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they have been surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into merchants seizing state-owned land to sell it for construction to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge U.S. subcontracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I’ve heard in the countryside, want a government that isn’t made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have managed American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are full of both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, and that look everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who led the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to re-establish provincial druins that would not submit to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent decentralized, following the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were present there only to conquer them.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper on site, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, a faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support of an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in a quest to “conquer hearts and minds” and fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defense’s “civil-military activity” (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local workers, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which is very harsh in these valleys, often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the Capia province.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, which are desired by farmers, as they told me, it is necessary to provide them with a small amount of non-military support, which would be well controlled and would come directly to them.
Difficult births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play a v-bank.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the work.
It has been almost two years since Egypt relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only intensified the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President will persist in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "violate this word" and "destroy the law".
His followers in the camp are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their intention of explaining the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is bursting across the country.
Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Times.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I reserve extraordinary powers,” which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were unanimously voted.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text on which the vote was held yesterday consists of 234 articles.
Object of general attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical to the article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of Sharia are the primary source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would enable their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the liberals answer, who see this only as a pillar.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
In particular, they point to Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because "people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the birth of the theocracy.”
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment there is no specific religious intervention.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system,” reassures Alexis Bleue, who is preparing a dissertation on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “around Article 220 there may be ambiguity, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the “fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is being criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have decreased significantly compared to those under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the defense budget will not be considered in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
It will also not prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be damaging to freedom.
Liability for blasphemy remains, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and in particular for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles is talking about protecting women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop of the Earth and the sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the originality of nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this "bowl" receives the grace of God.
And Galilee is the place of the wonders of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
The most holy is in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk through the Path of Tribulation or the Cross Way of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - the Pretory, - where there was a court, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Lord's Tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of the anointing and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pop of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected on the place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews - the Wall of Weeping, remaining from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes here, which are then fulfilled.
Travelling in Vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remain from the secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on rocky rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the ocean level.
Only those who are interested in alpinism can get to them.
The rest are transported to this historic summit by a cable lift.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain carries a shuttle bus.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain allegedly lived pagan gods.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can’t visit all of them on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It holds the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition are widely represented paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum-ban Al Bash, which is several halls of ancient Turkish baths with mules of visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caesaria, you should visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it – and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars blink.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
recovered
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanaries.
Interestingly, they swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is located at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below ocean level.
Azure water in it is a saltwater, easily holding on the float even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The landscapes around are incredibly beautiful.
They go here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapeseed, and curative mud, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring in order the shaken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept in the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander along narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist note
Going to Israel, don’t worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the country’s population knows Russian.
Money in the trip is better to take not in euros, but in dollars, which is easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mainly by bus, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa - the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
In fact, it is a subterranean funicular.
A trip in all forms of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can ride with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are closed.
On Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only cosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scaly and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There are a large selection of sheep and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, a variety of sauces, balls from hammered nuts - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
However, there are a lot of fed cats that willingly "walk on their own."
In the evening, they can be seen asleep even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murly loves crowded places and does not give up snacks.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance is $15 per day.
The rental of bicycles will cost 15 shec. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from around the world.
Most to travel and rest came citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than the same figure in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" to Moscow will bring: migrants dig money on the tongue
While deputies and human rights defenders argue what the law on compulsory language testing will give, scammers already appear in the country, trading "lip" certificates.
Every year, 13 million gastarbayers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left at home.
As of December 1, the law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to take the exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the sphere of services, housing and utilities, household and retail.
However, over time, - promise in the FMS, - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, you will have to pass not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed to obtain and to renew the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who were able to obtain certificates and diplomas on education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefit, Destination and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times had time to ask the press the question: what will this actually give?
What will change the mandatory knowledge of the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - respond representatives of the migration service, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representation of the FSF of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems appear in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to encounter dishonest people who, under the guise of help, will cast him a "trail" into a terrible tight barracks, where he and dozens of him like will be mourning for months without food and documents, drowning for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing at home, and when they arrive they are deceived, they are taken away from their passports, they do not pay the promised salary," said Talib Sharifov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Labour of Tajikistan.
Don’t be upset, thief!
Nevertheless, so far, many citizens of Central Asian republics, coming to Russia for income, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they aspire to, but also write on their own with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even a comprehensive primary education.
After all, their families have nothing even to feed their children, let alone to dress, shoe and equip them decently for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such boys at the first opportunity go to earnings.
It is difficult, if bad with knowledge of the language, they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of gastarbayters still reside in Russia illegally.
“Welcome, or Foreign entrance prohibited”
Many of the visitors claim that obtaining official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in the bureaucracy and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Officials of the Russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
“They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,” Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
“Fly, don’t squeeze, buy painting”
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only migration registration documents are fake.
Several “lip” certificates on passing language tests have already been withdrawn by FMS employees.
Fake paper is printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not in vain: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official test procedure: it will cost a labor migrant in three thousand.
In the fact that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "steps" could not just buy, representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
For the time being, the authorities can promise gastarbiters, who have not succeeded in passing the test from the first time, time to study a basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crime with the use of legal weapons is extremely low.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: shooting at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban wearing injury in public places and raise the age from which weapons license can be obtained - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Counter-Corruption Irina Yarova and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to tackle the problem by "turning the hooks."
In the network appeared an open letter, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to give up the "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies were committed, while in the same period 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they are monitoring the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" weapons market is replenished by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site receiving orders for weapons
The first is the “Army or Military Trail”, that is, weapons that were stolen during combat operations in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Barenets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from the representatives of the force structures.
Baranez explains that this includes both taken from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "stones" are being sold from military warehouses.
Explosions occurred frequently in military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were made specifically - to cover up the shortage," says the former military.
According to Baranz, weapons manufacturers contribute their contributions.
"Now there are private weapons factories that cannot withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia was formed, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design in 2011.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminal literature and open data of portals on weapons.
Most of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and security departments.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there "by the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are theft at the stage of weapons production, 5% falls on "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapon found by black miners, no one has been buying for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, for a new batch, sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the buyer, a person purchases a unit, such as a TT gun.
It is written out to him, transmitted through a locker.
"He carries her to the city and sells her here for 900 euros per piece with two stores," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when a plan on the disclosure of crimes burns, it conducts a control purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons," adds the consultant.
Like in a luxurious store.
The seller and buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a comrade responded, who suggested to come to the runway platform, where there will be a man who will take me to the corner, where we will trade.
I only found out the price there.
Military observer Victor Baranez
To get the trunk I need a friend who has a way out, - says the seller-consultant. - I have such a friend, but I am not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to transmit that the daughter's tooth fell."
I now even get a couple of castes through someone who is confident.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows I will not give him up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album with “everything.”
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranz, does not offer a cat in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential customer, don’t just buy – we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, we begin to negotiate," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", - they write in the advertising hat on the site "Buy a combat gun or machine".
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they be sold to minors?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthography saved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of counterfeit sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons scratch with a scratch.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then extract coal in Siberia.
Military observer and former military officer Victor Baranez
I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer makes the payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the public organization Right to Weapons.
Victor Baranez claims that by leaving an application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get jailed.

Machines for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate, you can put in the amount of $ 100 to $ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Weapons", the Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300 dollars.
I will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of identified facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
A quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart corporation wholesale stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken have risen across the United States.
No one is yet to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or it is destined to breathe out in its early stages.
The action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart workers and fast food systems receive, the protest organizers aim to create trade unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year.
Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales that captured millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by riots.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed, along with trade unions and leftist activists, the corporation’s stores, whose goods are allocated to humble and middle-income people.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paying Walmart employees only work at work.
Availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaper in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, such as the lack of car loaders or manual scanners.
Black Friday shareholders demanded a raise in wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker who earns $9.5 an hour doesn’t have the money in his pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart completely puts the wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause the corporation the slightest damage.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash machines made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a spokesman for the corporation, said in an interview with the Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was merely a “further pear trick” by the trade union that organized it.
“Free cash!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target were not Walmart stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you sickness and doesn’t pay you for honest work!
Jumein Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but not much, and their ordinary employees earn on average $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York for such money is inconceivable for me.
Once, almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald’s, who worked behind their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I’m constantly encountering interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, a Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them for.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and fast food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this and punishing trade union activists with spells and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But covering fast food by the trade union is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary flow of personnel.
Disagreed
Noisy protests took place this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was a mid-day rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, in particular a city council member, Jumein Williams, who said: “McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you sickness and doesn’t pay you for an honest job!”
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must be friendly in support of fast food workers so that they get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were fast food workers, in which tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
It is unclear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass movement.
"As long as you cheat the brain is average"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the theme of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technologies at the Cambridge Microsoft Lab Sharam Izadi follows that for the scientists of this company glasses - a stage passed.
They are intrigued by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Tell me in general, what is your research team doing?
“We are engaged in the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity is massively stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes ticking in them with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else is ahead of us?
“Al Kinect has moved interaction to the physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very much yet.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective.
We need to release the computer world into our physical, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but is it not overestimated?
- It can definitely not be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because you don't always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over large-scale, but over such scumpy, short.
At the same time, the gestures were not taken by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It’s still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a watch.
But in general, the future behind a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
Is it how?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this baking soda?
Tell and show at the same time.
I usually just talk.
It will be very difficult to recognize.
That is, do you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
Not necessarily, but it is mutual.
I think in the near future we will mostly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow for more accurate determination of human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, this is very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth or something else?
“In principle, the current generation is what we can push back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 kps.
But it’s not about megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us – this adds work to algorithm designers.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only the resolution on the axes X and Y, but also Z.
It is also very important the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30k/s is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bettyches of our Radmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would be very useful in my work an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require touches, so that the frames per second are larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
"Kinect now has three 'cams', one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually the usual visible range sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem.
Or increase it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curved location of the cameras and see how it will help in the three-dimensional positioning.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
"Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around all the time, holding your smartphone in your raised hands, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and so on everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time the weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of this idea: there is no tactile recall!
My hands feel nothing.
What answers is your team preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of image pad.
It records the pressures very well!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "images in the air" tangibility - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but for the time being it is very weak - as if you were knocked on the pillows.
There are also bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to cheat your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
That’s a good idea, I haven’t tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge, over which we will have to fight for a long time — how to make a person physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on the open, almost infinite — we are also working on the concepts of running tracks (not quite such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain is average, work is still very much for many years.
That’s what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher—a lot of things in an absolutely early state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top-list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the evocative artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who is found at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable showcases and retreats.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright person of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile in the citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently he took the charm in his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this difficult role with all his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
“Kyril, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
“I chose the red color as a fashion designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society, everything that is a little bit grey causes aggression and excitement of a bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- At the exhibition in D.C. Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free type of me was incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonewshina, which led to the "Pushkin-10", and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya 10, and there, until there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: NO, Tequila-Jazz, I remember how Schnur was brought up with the project Van Gogh’s ear.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the canvas, they were in a stretching trick, among them was the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the Halil-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and basic education and education he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Griboedov" is the voice of the Art Clinic.
Our employees have always gone.
I am a hero of yesterday’s century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was named I, my culmination was over.
In the new times, it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them clearly expressed relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a temporary category.
I used to be social, now being so is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now on clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the inner person.
And maybe he can't give his hand and spit in the swallow.
The deceit will be removed by changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you in the role of a city charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
To whom, if not to me.
Can art be beautiful?
Now commercial art should be careful, tactical, sweet.
There is disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people clashed in clusters, the Bohemians loved one thing, the prostitutes the other.
Now everyone is broken down into microcommunities, it is hard to like everyone now.
I’m not a $100 paper to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
A few thousand came to Stas Mikhailov.
- It comes out, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything will shrink.
I have fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the stuff.
In my youth I wrote such paintings that one collector had them hanged on the wall next to Falk and Laryonov.
I started with pictures that usually end.
They often confuse concepts.
They say: culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no consumption culture, it is from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, raised on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting.
I am for such a culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official of culture.
But not everyone can do culture.
With the right kings, things weren’t like that, the kings didn’t really understand culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
We in St. Petersburg have people who could be experts, but they are driven, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
The taste now flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept, there are such artists who have to look for other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, there is soil.
And on our stones it is hard for art to grow.
We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, that’s wrong.
Here in Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have that layer of tone.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of space ships with Earthmen on board go in search of a reserve planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises, how to continue our race in conditions of non-gravity or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg.
But if on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Experiments on plants were conducted half a century ago.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - the removal into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophils.
In 1979, eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in conditions of non-weight.
We get an absolutely normal puppy out.
Then the problem begins.
"The problem with the fact that this poultry must find support, he must get up on his legs and start moving," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding support, the chickens squandered disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The puppies did not react to light and sound.
And the problem was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we peeled the chickens, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "minikop" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will only be same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such studies need to be conducted," - notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had a offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
The most precious thing in humanity is the female body.
Our shark has flown away, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after the flight?
"Nobody answered this question," said the veteran of the missile-space industry, Wachtan Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited the orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We have few, there are units of astronauts, who after long flights have cost everything, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," summarizes the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnologies, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the CPC is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero floating, astronauts develop skills in open space.
Water imitates gravity.
If for adults, water, although comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
The small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months with the mother in the fetal fluid, it is easier for him to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it is only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for a born child, weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - gravity, gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic, the ability to push the fetus falls.
Well, okay, let's lower this, relying on stimulants of birth activity.
You can, of course, in a special chamber go for birth, she will push him out.
“And then what?” – asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
Children also need artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot, as an adult, be dressed in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment, which we will go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely disadapted person," predicts the head of the committee on bioethics of IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, over time, it will become a reality when the Earthans on their ships will travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Control and Audit Office: The verification of the swart system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control and Audit Administration, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack," Kala said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nechass's approach to the so-called shwartsystem is given.
Recently, the prime minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister can not oppose the work of institutions, which are charged with the duty to check and pursue the fulfillment of obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
I mean a parallel inspection that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the European legislation states how public procurement should be carried out, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was gathered and, even with an unfinished inspection, interesting differences were found - to put it simply, the legislation we have may be "exact and flawless", but in the practice of application we are in some parameters inferior to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such a joint control that can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will this by reducing the limit of orders.
Per this system will be overwhelmed with "papers" so that those who wish to find traps in this system will find them much easier than if the limit was not reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Administration) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, organized according to our principle, as our CRU, there is also a college that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - in this their system is slightly different from our own.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal council chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than here?
In general, I would not like to compare without concrete data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said with certainty that it is better in everything.
Is it because they do better with control?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they’t get any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affect your institution, somehow the consequences are manifested?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is relatively short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are conducting control on the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We only take this into account in the process of preparing for future audits – we started using our new “discovery of uneconomic risk” tool, through which we drove out 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will appear because the limits change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or add a burden to the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “stricter” and impossible to comply with.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programs – with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budget discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I think not this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
How to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called swart system.
Is the Schwartz system prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies, which are charged with the duty to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations.
You can say, “We will change this law and let it go,” but you can’t say that you will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally conducted, and this is right.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passed, but some places with more caution.
Karlovy Kraj
This morning in Karlovy Vary the roads were passable, but some places frozen and snowed.
The temperature has fallen from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should warm up a little bit.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the mountains.
From information obtained from regional road workers, it became known that places had lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently passing without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain roads, are passable.
But in some of their areas still lie the remains of frozen and places of snow.
Particular attention should be paid to roads located on the heights.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradsky Territory
The Czech Road and Highway Administration on its internet pages informs that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on the heights, there may be a layer of snow.
Regional road workers are warning drivers about the ice sheet, which can form especially in the heights of the Pardubitsk region.
Hololed can be near Lanzkrun, Usti nad Orlic, Policki, Svitavi or Vysoké Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and the Orly Mountains.
The covered layer of snow is on the roads located on the elevations in the regions of Rakhnov-on-Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern part of the Czech Republic today variable clouds without rainfall.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzeňský kraj
Roads in the Plesensk region this morning are passing, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is cold, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
Locally drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by local road workers.
The D5 road is now practically unlimited, however, road managers recommend to be careful between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Plzn and Tahov can be found frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third class are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-use roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc End
Drivers headed to the altitude of Olomouc region, today must take into account the snow on the road.
It remained after the application of chemicals in the Red Mountain Saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlskiy Krzyszysz.
During the night, snowfall forced road workers to come out on the streets, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas of the border, roads are usually passed without restrictions.
“On the heights of Shumperk are the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should bear in mind the presence of snow in the Red-Gorsk seat,” said today the Chancellor of the Schumperk Road Administration to the Czech News Agency.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clean the roads, they assured that the roads on the heights after the treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads pass without restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity is still preserved.
Ustecký kraj, Liberecki kraj
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several hard-to-pass places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road on the part of Telnica on the Clinic in Usteck Territory has been closed.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Middle Mountain, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Shteti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day rains and snow melted, at night the sky clarified and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are on the main highway and on the I/13 track on the border of Usteck and Liberec.
Because of the curved under the layer of snow branches of trees touching the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica on Bookica.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many alarming news that we humans find so easy to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is announced to end on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than our.
Who came to mind with this idea?
At first it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will one day be passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus also provide us with support.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is cancelled".
Will the YouTube fans already love the anthem at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything goes well and the end of the world does not come.
It is performed by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthem will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip Thomas Ganak, participates in the performance also Xindl X...
How did you start collaborating with them?
We also collaborate with other persons of the Czech cultural life as we host many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively engaged in these projects.
Many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the revenue from the concert against the end of the world go to?
On the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civic association Tap at the Yedlichka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Yedlich Institute and conduct fun and interesting events with them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them that opportunity.
Within the framework of the additional construction project of the Edlichka Institute, a separate building will emerge in the future, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several music groups and performers will perform.
What were the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to abroad, you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and toolboxes.
Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which has surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitude to disabled people, and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that the East is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and there is still a strange self-driving person on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also there is no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of execution of which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those who are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own on the streets, to go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrierlessness is one thing, but when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything really starts to change.
Until now, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is now very popular, but let’s go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Edlichka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and I play, including on a saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has popularity only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, it helped us that we started joining the famous singers and actively working on the band’s propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate does not actually exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of creating the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that imitate each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, it is natural.
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some sort of suffering and all abandoned personalities that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it is a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you succeed because you are a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do work quality, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But that’s what happens in any group that wants to work and something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many were there in 1998?
Only one lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, this is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno at the Fléda club and Ostrava at the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telemost at the time of the performance of the song of the Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million SEK for the procurement of multifunctional, barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 SEK, entrance is free for children up to 12 years old. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency on September 12, 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years took an active part in a number of ESA projects.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Space Science".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 – 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known worldwide prophet of space, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925 a railway was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to propel or to brake the truck.
Information about this dress is known only from the press of that era.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Section of weapons technology in cooperation with the professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mochitsky.
From the remaining materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter missile, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and in the following year the work "Airborne missile-torpedo and aviation missile-bomb" by the author Lelyva-Kzhivobloksky was published.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war, the Temporary Scientific and Consultative Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) co-ordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work ended due to the start of the war.
The following scientific work, devoted to cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems", which publishes four volume articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will engage in cosmonautics.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining turnover, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall the POA became its actual member.
And the following year, the first Chairman of the PAA Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to perform scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 missile was tested at the Bledovsk Pustyr.
This missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to engage in real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type missile was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designed as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of flight for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aviation developed the Meteor-2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to take a useful cargo weighing 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the Cospar (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the Cospar National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germanševsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
The decision has sparked a lively debate in society.
It would be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unrestricted financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of labor (wage) there is a price tension.
This concept should be understood as a state where the manufacturer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to stand up in economic competition by "slashing" the value of the competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance.
Since private capital carries no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditure of the state for social needs is growing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage they cause in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual states situations where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to economically force its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail workers’ rights in the sphere of labor law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and therefore the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years there has been a social distribution of products to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases where employed people get such a salary that the state must pay them to get a subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are either forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on a miserable wage at the back of society in the hope that one day private investment capital will come into the country.
But the question is, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the mass media to nausea claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by managing actions.
Next, we must answer the question, does not the private capital, which now practically governs politics and thus the whole state, act for its own selfish purposes?
The unambiguous answer is yes.
The evidence is that there are practically all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation, where virtually everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to a lack of funds, entrust the development of bills to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
The bill is then approved by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitution of the Western type states, but from the financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberally-oriented democracy is now rapidly in a situation as described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long been disintegrating, and the departments are engaged in violence.
bribes, illegal receipt of mercy with the help of stones and swords.
Strenuousness and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a voting sold in advance""... orderly people did not run for the position of ruler at all, after all, one day the state for eight months remained without a consul".. .. "They seriously began to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is self-government and the need to choose an energetic man ".. Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it became Caesar, who finally changed democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, in modern society prevail their own reckless interests without consideration of public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended for use for public purposes.
The current outcome is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out deeper reforms.
So the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite is completely ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen state participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "The Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "We don't forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, they’t have been,” said Guthel Schnapper, wife of Meyer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a lot of reactions.
Some support Israel, arguing for its position that it has the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who in these periodically repeated waves of murder is the criminal and who is the victim, after all, today’s citizens of Israel, including autonomous territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and were not witnesses to the onset of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look beyond the curtain, to see what the tensions that have lasted for 95 years (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) have served in the first place on a small piece of Middle East.
Some of my arguments are supported by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their steps entirely independently, or someone behind their throne stood who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
It should be assumed that we are living in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be regarded as the head of a spruce (I don't know if anyone stands above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
of course .
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) in the 1990s to put an end to rumors linking their name to criminal activities in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to strengthening their power, multiplying wealth, or both at the same time.
They have large shares in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the central bank behind the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (the Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great Mason of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially of Britain, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds works is to challenge the crisis and subsequently propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to worsening the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, initiating the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unjustified military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, banks and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing enormous military reparations on Germany, creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to give the Germans a strong enough, denouncing the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Leader, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of the fifth column, in the sparking of the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to estimate whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a focal point for World War III.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become the victims of fighting on the frontline, now along with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to be the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where outrage generates outrage in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to vote exclusively on their own candidates.
Israel’s current prime minister, Yastreb Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to grow into a world conflict, and given Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of the world’s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he makes every man, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a seal on his right hand or on his forehead, so that anyone who is not marked with the name of the beast or with the number of his name may neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: Everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of the beast.
For it is a human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When the worst is nowhere, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student protesters seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah out of board, because this could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days of negotiations with the mediation of the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to Jimmy Carter’s defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, Operation Argo describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult journey, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them from Iran, and this was helped by the extravagant coverage legend, according to which they left on Canadian passports as members of the filming group, looking for a place in the country for the shooting of a science fiction epic.
Combination of Genres
The plan, which was invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required collaboration from Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be credible, specialized journals wrote about the project of the film, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "cinema-opus", the story of a successful event, an affair - an example can be a series of films about Oushen's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, eased Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck made a reboot of his career.
From the ridiculous actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck that is not filmed in the director's hometown - Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows this in Argo, where Tehran “playes” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, while reconstructing real events – the entry scenes of the embassy’s fall impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere the story suddenly changes.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters at the Tehran bazar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes thinking something — there it all goes out not so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an imminent crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the pursuit on the runway look quite fictional).
The disadvantage of Argo is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a movie that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro-style, recreating the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it captures hard.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a sense alive history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence are.
Rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for the "most absurd resolution or project from the EU workshop".
“We have been prompted to this by the latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the poll.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on combining the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury heaters only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the chicken cage size directive, which has led to significantly higher prices for eggs this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of a veto defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union should have reached the length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "anomal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by merely harmonising existing divided national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, has softened the standards for fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directives will lead to product waste.
A winning candidate in the poll could also be last year’s EU regulation, according to which airballs sold must be equipped with a warning that children under the age of eight can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to U.S. research that shows that ballooning during play is a potential cause of children’s death by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing in the trade fairs.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but must instead say "BURM" (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "Laissez Faire", has proposed to vote, in addition to several of the above mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the amount of food supplies on the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies that can be held in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for having no sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of so-called intervention procurements, the state had full stocks of stocks that had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies to receive subsidies were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Niemec (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to drafting applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Strange orders are an exception
Although regulations in Member States are easily criticized, the EU’s regulatory efforts, as well as efforts to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, are, according to many experts, rather worthy of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies on projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved during budget discussions.
It is exciting among the Czechs and the fact that, like in other European countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomoucki cheese", but "Totzemský rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from barley distillate, not from sugar beets.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "fetha" and "gorgonzola", marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parm branch, have already been, for example, Karlovar sushi, pogorzelitsky and Tšebonsky karp and Zhatetsky hmel.
Also the EU trade mark can be proud of Pardubitsky spice and Gorzitska tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I am an amateur, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think of running for president?
I’m not thinking about becoming a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked smoothly, I’t be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country robbed over the last 20 years, the thieves are rushing, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am forty years old and I am an independent person who does not belong to any party, I have no other option to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You entered the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back to the people who chose you?
I have always said that I will fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I was elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are roaring at our bar or at the TV, but at the same time are ready to melt anyone who tries to change something.
In addition to this, there are the media that blacken people, and that confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribery to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irja Paroubek.
Let us go to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with the theses about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about the return of property declarations for the sum of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You, as president, have no such powers, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied to make excursions a free business, it succeeded.
The problem lies in politicianship – when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, he is deliberately hindered, and this restrains citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it, without having to lay down the shelves by the party, without looking at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more right-wing or left-wing?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people consider me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for us to move forward.
The point is not that someone is right, but someone is left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any decision that is good for society, whether it is proposed by the CPC or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But do you not prove this with what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
This is what you are trying to approach.
You might call it populism, but all the propositions I’m talking about already work in the world, or prominent experts are talking about them.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have slogans.
In politics, you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our side so that we can our goal.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would address the heads of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to tell why they do not want to.
If there is a strong personality that speaks out abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections – it was the merit of public pressure.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and I will try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I’m trying to move forward on my own; if I don’t, I’ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds in part as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused because of a lot of work.
I also at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan Lorenzov, who revealed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I nominated because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the weights.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the election, and most of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independent senators in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of each potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for it.
No money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how are your own affairs with this?
The personal assets are estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth approximately $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of art worth approximately $10 million, an Aston Martin worth $3.5 million, a Škoda Superb worth $1 million, and a few million more.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boy’s dream – I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was talented with women and at the same time fought against wickedness and lawlessness.
Do you drive Aston Martin, own a $60 million estate and don’t have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
It is not very convincing.
I don’t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The campaign expenses will be covered by the senator’s salary.
But with that money I’t live, for example, I’t be able to pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not have run anywhere.
So, will you continue to do business so that you can live?
Didn’t you say that you’re going to reduce this activity?
It does not depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would want me to be a silverless man who will keep the republic.
I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you accustomed to earning per month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get.
And if I became president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Right".
Architects MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Spikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lysette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says, “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself: Why do we need another library today?
Everyone has internet, iPads and e-books.
Nowadays no one volunteers to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spikenisse, a little notable sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance, several years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesque painted miniatures of iron concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only chance to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and the author of ingenious, sometimes even cynical constructions, treated the task with his usual restlessness and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his head and a smile on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around confusedly and shrugged their shoulders, the bold Maas made a pyramid-size of his original gift and concluded his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here is it, my suggestion: The Book Mountain in Spikenisse, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros has grown.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the competition "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national wood construction competition.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which previously could offer nothing but a post-modern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest the idea of a milk factory, became richer by one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly - in Spikenis appeared the first in the history of this town public building of cultural purpose.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator passing through the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glassed room on all sides is light and easily visible, burned brick floors and elegant street lights create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly reconstructed.
The eye unwittingly looks for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere – books, books, books.
“Typically, book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of space from foot to head and pulled out the reading area from the inside out.
The interior space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Especially delighted black book shelves, which serve as the decoration of the walls, the parapets, the staircases.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in guessing what this unknown material is.
“We aimed to work with secondary materials,” explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spikenisse community, in line with the requirements of the standard.
And once on an agricultural plant in Frisland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fiber material millimetre thickness has been used as a base under the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas – for the first time in such volumes – was pressed into a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called landscape plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little shoe.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who overcomes a path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wooden ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Troubort.
The heat of the earth is used for its heating and cooling.
Although Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Large wooden farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take over most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig has also been here.
As well as lecturer of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg "the Spikenisse soul that was long missing."
A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own assembly.
These books were supposed to occupy empty places on the shelves of the still not fully equipped library – at the time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are placed above.
“There is nothing worse than a semi-empty library,” says architect Vini Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for jewelry.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spikenise wrote his literary history.
They are very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: “Germans should play a more important role”
Germany abstained from voting on recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic path by doing so.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why is ?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO implemented this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely moving from the policy that, so to speak, was ruled by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a concerted common policy.
The Germans are once again between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that for now they are only perceiving their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is the willingness to take a position in their national interests, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ greatly from the interests of other major states, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to insult the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I’t attach too much importance to this, it’s not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relationship with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player on the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the contrary, has clearly vetoed.
Is there a disagreement between the United States and many European countries?
Due to American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the substantial differences in opinions are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not entirely enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would have been a little easier for the Germans if there had been a unified, non-contradictory European policy, but this is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act within the framework of a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
This is how they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take on the main role?
Or is the leading role still hard to give to Germany?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don’t just deal with it.
In fact, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to take into account the very different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
So the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant, or it’s intensified by a lack of love for you – that’s life!

China's "trademark protection": when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren – too.
What is Armani Polo?
It is an officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
However, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in trademark infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new thing appears on my desk.
Simulators need to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is obtained Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-storey supermarkets that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, the case of Pattloch is not so.On behalf of his trusts, he opposes that Chinese enterprises should officially obtain from the trademark registration office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it “ban minpai”, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with “ban дакуань”.
This is what they call women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
"This is damaging to business, it needs to be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
“The brand is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copying products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with sales of €15 billion per year.
However, removing dubious entries in the trademark register is difficult and expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff fails, he will even have to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister shortly before.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with whom the famous crocodile looked in the opposite direction.
The Chinese are not guilty.
The trademark registration office CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of personnel and equipment.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency situation in the working process to normal.”
So, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still awaiting proceedings in the department.
Fighting it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth consecutive time, China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide, the ministry said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, just 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to protest, as the case of the German family-owned enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to that the illegal production of their counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
This was a personal omission, as surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hannah Ventzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trade mark registration office CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the struggle to this day.
Must be watchful
The matter is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs can hardly be accounted for, the company's archives had to look through even centuries-old acts to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "great six-digit sum in euros" for settlement.
"Here it is clear how expensive it is for us," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Especially if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The company has long stopped production in these areas, but has nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
“We need to be vigilant,” says Ventzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch are advising German to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations for the protection of trademarks, rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way, also register in China,” says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we will be driven out of the market in the controversial segment.
World Aids Day: Pulling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that overcame a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, the immersion is given: cowboy boots, basketball boots, women's boats and men's tapes pick up the tactic on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Two or three or four.
Only after this slowly increase the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come on, charm and follow one another.
And Fitte Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, is barely jumping out of his mattress shoes as he guides them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbonga's choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a courtier.
Om Obanis is a difficult thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, in addition to a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essen, Voices for Africa has found bosses in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on the bosship.
It guarantees the child money for school, school clothes and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means a storyteller or praise.
In this room, they don’t speak hard on the band, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has taught songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even brought them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers in the summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
40% are infected
There live about 2000 people, some still in simple clay and straw cottages, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from the HIV virus.
In Essizhen, the miniature reflects the disease of all of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost unacceptable among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth tenth is not uncommon.
The choir discovered this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the Imbogni participants saw a lot of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants – for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to get a hot meal once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Essitzhen.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial HPVs include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral HPVs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The lobular pediculosis and scabies belong to parasitic PTIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mostly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
The human papillomavirus is also common among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be registered.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
With infectious diseases, ulcers can occur in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, in part, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and by close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, you can cure most illnesses and avoid distant consequences.
Chiefhood, donations and not least honoraries for choir performances throughout Germany allow for something to gather.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Essitzhen," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village, money from Germany is handled by Tsoda Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care that the orphans are well-organized, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu old women call it, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care to ensure that the children in shape appear to the classes on time every day.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter to Hanysila, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two chefs who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chickens and jointly with the American health organization PSI organized HIV testing for many inhabitants of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to be deeply silent.
The King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re barely used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir travels southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, martial spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black language – such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Essitzhen, where singers visit under-chief children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Eculveni River it is more than known.
“Go to Essitzhen, there is light,” the people there say.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the tapping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns here too.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is ice on Mercury.
The ice can be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the presence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that the planet’s constantly shaded region is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
It is believed that water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the scientific director of the probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed to Earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, according to the 2006 new definition of the International Astronomical Union, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, more difficult to identify in the star circle pink “newborn” stars.
This region of star formation — scientists unromantically call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This overflowing heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
A punch-like ring consists of the material that the star has thrown out in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope has taken this photo of the galactic maternity room.
The Plejadic star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope the colors get better.
Like a red eye flashes to the observer, the nebulae of the Rush in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the Earth continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color rendering.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of the infrared sensors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they arose is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It may be fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Aquarius galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of the Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-sided, three-sided), because the dark stripes of dust divide the hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Snake Bear, astronomers have photographed the forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are facing each other and will inevitably collide.
This birth of the star was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don’t like technical abbreviations can call it the “Southern Wheel”.
A photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
The nebula, which is 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust particles which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary home dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The galaxy constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosetta nebula, also continuously creates new stars – 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey — even before Galileo Galilei began observing stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown more and more – and the spaces available to their eyes are getting deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Halle Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescope Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of a single mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the “Great South African Telescope” in South Africa has been segmented – in order to reduce costs.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fixed under a vertical angle – this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its characteristic is high light capability.
It reaches – despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror – the parameters of the world’s largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the “Search for extraterrestrial intelligence” (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very Large Telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow lighting in the visual tube even the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO Chilean Observatory is also planning to install the European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is expected to stretch for 42 meters - and will consist of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them also looks into the sky with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope will appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
You can look at the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he has delivered paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo captures the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not earlier than 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data about this, as the Messenger orbits closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger spacecraft, the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure of this.
Drink oil every day and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach a biblically respectable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds still look relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach a biblically respectable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds still look relatively young.
A trip through the Tallys mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with thunderstorms runs along a twisted road past the hills, the turbulent rivers and the simple peasant houses that have grown in thick forests.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think you are in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Here live talishs - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerich.
The small town boasts too heavyweight architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tired.
323 kilometers take eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerique.
“In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest – and next year we will host the festival of the world’s oldest people,” says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented biography of about eight dozen talis from these places, which are more than 100 years old.
My grandfather is 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he gave birth to another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Chaban Shirali Muslymov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
The birth certificate is not.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, the age of Musliumov appears to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaeva explained.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Did the Chaban Muslims add a couple of decades to their age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-lived people in Central Asia.
“The surprising number of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “and there are also extremely many very elderly people in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of hot oil every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerique surprisingly often reach biblical age.
There are 20 people over 100 years old here.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special talis genes.
The director of the Fatulaeva museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about nutrition.
The waist loves meat, bread and mostly dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted oil every day.
Or is it about the primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chengmiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoev lives.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tiredly rides there and there.
Here, under the same roof, eight people live, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long since had their grandchildren.
There are also two children in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, the guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical blended glasses of armud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her scarf she hides long dark brown hair, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always put milk on my hair so that it never fell out and retained its color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzaeva.
The monthly pension is sufficient.
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts.
I have never bought anything in the store in my whole life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it became better when “loved father” Heydar Aliyev stood by the wheel.
Propaganda doesn’t often sound in the old woman’s speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, practically knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani seniors.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount for which you can live well.
And the long-grown son of Mirzaeva is also right: "Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not included in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo show the country’s deep split.
The future sharia-based constitution has met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not fall to Paphos.
We need to make a transition.
"And his success lies on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but primarily to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are frightened.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brotherhood".
Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily narrowed the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competence "to save the revolution."
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be destroyed?
In fact, 234 articles were pulled through in a night-long 15-hour obstacle jump at an Islamist-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partially alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the bill states that judicial proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law.”
What does “principles” mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal loft for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases relating to Sharia, the University of Al-Ashar, the country’s most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in the entire Sunni Islam, should be attracted to council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which de facto would have the consequence of limiting the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is subject to interpretation.
Another problem: the subject of civil persons to the military court must beined.
These courts during Mubarak's reign served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prison.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morality and values".
Juridically, this is formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the jurist?
The question of interpretation, as much in this draft, which Morsi proposes for signature and which, he said, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
The revolution is back.
For several weeks, the opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimousness on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
“The revolution has returned, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabhachi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international atomic energy agency, Mohammed El Baradei, said the draft constitution was “on the trash of history.”
Through the short news service Twitter, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “putch against democracy.”
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him off,” Yasser Said, the opposition leader, said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges have also said they do not want to observe the referendum, which would invalidate it.
“The Quran is our Constitution”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under cover and Salafists who shouted, “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Morsi, “clean the country!” and assured, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, provoked a state of virtually civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the electoral urn which direction the country should go.
Most for the project of Islamists, this is considered a settled matter.
The concept of “human rights” is never mentioned.
Hafiz Abu Saida was furious at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when under Mubarak they were in prison or in court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" is never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Morsi’s influence on all three branches of power in the state disappointed the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto canceled it," said Saeda.
Without civil society, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, who looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a payment for this.
A demonstrator at Tahrir Square warns: “You’re creating a monster you can’t control.”
Norwegian sharkfish: the worst smelled fish in the world?
With a population of five million, Norway has one of the highest standard of living not only in Europe but in the world.
Per the secret of this country’s success is somehow related to the local addiction to one extremely odorious fish dish?
Take a few overcooked pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a stinking smell of shrimp - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around the picturesque views covered with snow.It is very beautiful, but in the air is poured out an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rackfish is a forel, dried with salt and brown in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of mat to.
As the dusk gets thicker and cooler, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, so to speak, exciting dish.
“They eat it raw and drink it with a bowl of aquavit, local thinning vodka,” explains Howard Halwarsen, a local firefighter by profession and by combination a “rackfish general” who manages the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it with considerable portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavite more than rackfish,” says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If you can put a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - it is little different from the portion of sushi that you took with you in the bus for a long time.
Rackfish is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically closed barrels with salt water in the autumn.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, having suppressed the perception of alcohol, consumed as food.
Even in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-standing rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come here to work.
The rackfish is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat odorless, element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here – a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most inhabitants of the country seem to be happy with it.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "July 22".
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Today’s well-being is driven by the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“H, oil isn’t the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, a woman with long, light hair and strikingly blue eyes, embodying Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don’t like to show up, we’re not glamorous.
Norway treats its oil very carefully – most of the revenue of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when everyone was plagued with money they didn’t have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go on hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
“And there’s a rackfish,” she adds with a careless laugh.
I’m standing in the snow in a row for some food – I’ll have enough fish.
Here, a hamburger with salmon meat is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel holds a special dinner dedicated to shrimp, during which visitors vote for the best, or the most fragrancy, fish.
There is a direct TV show, which shows the host in a butterfly tie, surrounded by plates with a rackfish.
It is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
“So, Thor-Jurgen, what was your assessment for the best fish there in the mountains?”
“Yes, Howard, this is our assessment.”
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, possibly by crossing the aquavite.
Or maybe just breathing the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has a difficult start to his career.
As Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he faces and the mixed expectations of the people of his country.
Road traffic in Mexico is currently in a deplorable condition.
This city is overcrowded by transport and at its best, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear the presidential tie and take over the rule of the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the government of Felipe Calderón, which is now taking office, but the country is plunged into a drug war that has taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to this goal.
Prior to such statements, alongside the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto’s political career developed as governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and extensive state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents place it in the merit of revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with pebbles and holes that were previously in this place.
Tables with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We’re linking him with hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Penya Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was suppressed in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of contentlessness raised by the opposition to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
He is a great politician and, above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nassau, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also have the harsh nature of this megacity.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to humiliate the drug trafficking gangs in these areas; and violence against women is acute here.
In the desert near a vast landfill only in the last two years several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico during the governorate of Mr. Peña Nieto—a figure far higher than that in the sadly violent city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name has become nickname when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Penya Nieto, in the best case, it can be said that during his tenure as governor he failed to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
An inhabitant of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this crisp neighborhood, Ireneia Buendia struggles to hold back her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her fellow resident.
“When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed before,” Ms. Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already clogged.
Mariana’s mother tells the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifixion, on which is written only one word: justice.
This is what, according to them, was denied to this family.
“The state officials treated me as an old gossip, an unhappy violator of calm.
They want people to simply believe everything they say and remain silent.
But this is wrong, so it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
Having worn the presidential tie on Saturday, President Penya Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has vowed to make this issue a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president he was a governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Sidney are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning’s claims about poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, more attention was paid to Manning’s presence in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is demanding that the case be closed on the grounds that the conditions of Manning’s detention were brutal.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that ordinary Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified materials in U.S. history, failed to use many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he said he suffered while in a military prison.
During a cross-interrogation at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor major Ashden Feyn said records of Manning's weekly visits by prison administration during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-interrogation as part of the examination of Manning's defence request to terminate the case on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and sufficient punishment were carried out the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the website WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday’s hearing, Attorney Feyn and Manning reviewed reports that followed Manning’s visits by administration officials during his stay in Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he rated the prison administration’s treatment of himself as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reports did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Feyn says.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concern about these issues and that the representatives of the administration who visited him discussed these issues with him and stated that they would deal with them, but did not record this in writing.
"They recorded 'no problems' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise that topic in the conversation," Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about ill-treatment in January 2011 during a committee meeting that examined suicidal intentions, which he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that session he wanted to get rid of the “traumatic warning” regime and soften the conditions of imprisonment.
Military officials explained that a restricted detention regime – lower than the supervision regime to prevent suicide – was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay, that they can cancel the trauma prevention regime... that the level of my life improves, from my point of view,” Manning explained.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that one day he lost consciousness due to the heavy heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to the base of Camp Arishan, to the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I would die in that cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small chamber — at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day — in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, clothes, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was prohibited by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, his eyes were constantly beaten by the light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, he said he was being woke up and forced to turn his back.
Manning’s lawyer filed an official objection to Manning’s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livingstone, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from a guard’s order that he had to throw a blanket that could cover himself, but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning that he told the officer that he could use a coward's rubber or shrapnel to injure himself, but he did not.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, clothes and glasses were removed from the chamber.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to experience during his detention and will significantly shorten the term of detention in case Manning is found guilty by a military court, which should begin his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and the prosecutor is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges, Manning was charged with involvement in the enemy, illegally facilitating the disclosure of data on the Internet, transferring national defense-related information, and theft of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all points of the indictment, he may be threatened with life imprisonment.
My Crisis of National Self-Determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarre believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the arrival corridor, approached the border control zone and stuck in place.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and I was called Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped on the complex design of “American of Mexican origin.”
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complicated structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I got my U.S. passport and got in the line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The topics on the agenda of the two presidents’ meetings were immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans would now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc similar to the European Union.
In addition, President Pena Nieto has promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a tough and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans have never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under a gunshot of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only worth any U.S. official to speak out at least a word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society, complaints are immediately distributed that Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with hostility.
At the same time, the most difficult is Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Want to talk about insults?
They are enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those for whom there are no opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for just one reason: at some point in their family history, someone – father or grandfather – had no chance of realizing themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type - sluggish, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico they see it differently.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we have studied in good schools and got a good job, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as false Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they’t have left.
We would not find ourselves now behind the silk curtain, finding a full life in the United States, but losing our spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans – Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my American acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of the two worlds inevitably loses roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations were not already confused enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-born Americans to work as some kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends how beautiful this country is and how great it is to visit, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Oh of course.
Nothing will come out.
Too many offenses in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rise of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
Sorry, but do it yourself, Amigos.
And that is fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-born Americans are still offended for how they recently treated their relatives in Mexico.
Yes is .
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It sounds like usual, meaningless disputes about who first started; many buildings have become ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of Israel’s capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly trapped in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” rounded up in the uprising storm many established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis failed to stay away from the whirlwind that shook the region.
Per as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope to get out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, this week's clashes have only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, will declare that they have forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million inhabitants locked up in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing its popularity on the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
The emerging regional leader Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Solemn Hamas supporters are announcing the creation of an Islamist moon around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the militant Hezbollah group, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Assad’s power, and further to Jordan, where the king’s authorities threaten Hamas’ allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic settlements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not even be silenced by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was defeated militarily.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas-launched missiles.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States has remained faithful to its unchanged stance; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel’s economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that roughly 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide terrorists, partly through the wall that enters the West Bank – a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state – and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu’s position, whose Likud party – in preparation for the January 22 election – has joined with the even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of giving the Palestinians their own state?
If all the power on the West Bank is handed over to them, will they not start firing rockets from there toward Israel, as their fellow Gazans do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hardly suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Probably the hardline will win; however, their calculations may be disproved by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who are coming to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Launching a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to the same extent, must consider the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democratic changes in Arab countries begin, the deprivation of Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a delayed bomb that will sooner or later explode on Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only aggravates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need external impulse.
The only solution remains that is tirelessly called upon by reasonable representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel’s concessions of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since decided to halt arms supplies to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more advantageous position than ever before to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, with a view to the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama should also play a role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows reluctance to join the solution.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible if a peace agreement is reached between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the unified cigarette packaging law has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of diseases affected parts of the body contrastingly stand out on dull green boxes, the same for all cigarette brands.
The first Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color designs of different brands with the same box of dull-olive colour with horrifying images of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning about the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages, introduced in mandatory order from this Saturday - the names of brands, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the world’s toughest conditions for tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says the goal of the measure is to keep young people from smoking by depriving this harmful habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“It’s obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging,” said Tanya Pliebersek, health minister, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering the possibility of taking similar measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies say this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those conceived by its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family-owned company called Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for port-cigarettes and silicone envelopes that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (practically from scratch) since companies like British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in a high court in Australia two months ago, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, the company Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale enterprises and is expecting a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and supporting them for sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in prominent places, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing online advertising, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you only have that little hole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of brands written on behalf of allegedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the business of the ordinary citizen, who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret the effort and time and made the video, or is there a advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tania Pliebersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to impose a mandatory photo warning about the harm of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia demonstratively do not obey the innovations.
These pictures do not touch me.
I just don’t pay attention.
"You just pick up a cigarette and hide the package in your pocket," explains Victor El Hague, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the package.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me give up is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on the shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload a new batch, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and completely banned cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's all over, we close the store," he says, lifting his hands up.
Missing in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our aircraft had mechanical problems and was replaced with another aircraft, which we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and here neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help much.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and children’s development specialists have spoken in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, missing is not so bad for us and our children.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Per we need to strive for boredom?
Yes is.
And at the same time not.
We will return to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was a relatively recent invention, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii were found Latin inscriptions about boredom dating back to the first century.
At the same time, the question remains open about how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research materials on this topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but can’t do something that would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they’d like to do.
With apathy, I don’t want to do anything.
The main thing about experiencing boredom, he says, is “the disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is running slowly.”
To describe boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we actually just have a hard time focusing on something.
In their study, “Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom from the Point of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previous experiment, the participants of which listened to the recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of an unrelated television program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign soundtrack.
Those participants who heard low-volume television noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking into the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed, he continues, that when people begin to bend on a chair or draw carapace on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not forbidden to swing and turn learn better and remember more information than children who are asked to sit down humbly,” says Professor Fenské.
At some point we all experience boredom: when a flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "tendence scale to boredom".
Questions and statements are used to determine the score on this scale, such as "Many of the things I have to do are monotonous and monotonous" or "I am interested in too much, so there is no time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
Adolescents are often missed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to connect with 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents say they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescence has a peak tendency to get bored,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it, as studies show, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
“So our brains tell us to do something else; it’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this brain does not always know exactly what to do.
If you get bored and you turn that energy on playing the guitar or cooking experiences, you will do better for yourself.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and it will soon pass.
Therefore, if your child is missing and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to cope with boredom on his or her own or to manage his or her time and occupation in any other way.
"And such skills of independent regulation are used in very different situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to do something independently, he also learns self-control in general.
I don’t think boredom needs to be exaggerated.
However, considering it something bad is also not worth it.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
“We see it so that we need to experience boredom more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we’re accustomed to the constant excessive stimulation of our senses,” he says, “and when there’s silence, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is still unclear how the new marijuana law will apply in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football player and public college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr Orosko says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and were driving a car through the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer discovered marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosko was ordered to court for possession of drugs and possession of a drug device – minor offences for each of which a $100 fine was due – and a date for the trial was set.
“They treat us like criminals,” says Mr Orosko.
Is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize small amounts of marijuana for entertainment, the settlement of hundreds of small lawsuits depends not so much on the law as on the place of the trial.
Accusations of minor marijuana-related offences have already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and older for holding small doses, which will be considered legal once the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana and are still being prosecuted for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, are voting to prevent the appearance of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their locations.
“It’s all going so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” says Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the control bodies in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They will have to formulate rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for good or for bad, outperforms most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"Colorado has a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for Regulation of Alcohol Production and Sales in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to make suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and will throw the state into a year-long state of uncertainty when the state’s licensing system is not yet in place and the right to possess marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be difficult to place licensed marijuana within cities, in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group, the Centre for Marijuana Legalization.
On November 21, police chief Outs of Aurora emailed his subordinates that the city’s prosecutor’s office would no longer bring persons aged 21 to justice for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police would stop accusing people of these violations “from now on.”
Police chief Oates said the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of people who grow marijuana for medical purposes and will prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
Prosecutor Ken Buck, of the Uleed County in northern Colorado, presents a stricter approach to the matter.
After voting on the bill, he said the prosecutor’s office would continue to prosecute for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage people who use it to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The obligation of our institution is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,” Mr. Bak said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Jankshn, the largest city in the district, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to remove charges in cases already opened related to marijuana possession.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents voted in favour of the decision, incorporating marijuana use for entertainment into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicts for marijuana holding and a local representative for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They have persecuted people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as much as alcohol, are destined to become a nationwide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are looking forward to instructions from the federal authorities, which are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of marijuana legalization hope that the Office of Justice will give in on this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical purposes, the federal government has mostly favored the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Office agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes on state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug advocate in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which would not be able to open before a year later.
Last week, Montrouge, a city in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
The municipality voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella White: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember, I’ve always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization – free-thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the University of Oxford’s Wooster College’s Faculty of History in the late 1980s, I picked up my suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard that I left college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in a neighboring room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from the bottled cups.
In fact, it wasn’t so funny.
I have escaped.
Yes, I fled because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or because I was in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked like barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow White, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to right-centered views are subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Corpus Christi College student club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal assaults and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College’s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recent BBC 2 documentary about student politics "Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were presented by eccentricists and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, a former president of the Conservative Association of the University of Oxford, who rides a rolls-roye, wears a silver suit and a trunk with a silver trunk.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made “the goats of dismissal because of higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “the university environment is increasing in the direction of left-wing views.
People who don’t even know us think of us as rude and unpunished children of wealthy parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College, where the request for reinforcement was filed, calls the atmosphere “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says the attitude of members of the student club to right-centered viewers has deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members,” she says.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old.
Oxford was feverishly hated by the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to cuts in budgetary appropriations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first-class week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I first felt what was ahead of me.
I didn’t know yet that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the seduction of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues – miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa – have penetrated through the wooden panel walls of audiences.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
“Miss White,” said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text was difficult for me, I was locked up.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow man with a face that looked like a cake.
“The Tatcherists do not teach French in principle, or do they just lack brains?” he asked.
Other students were shaken.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I would advise you to take a few primary lessons of French in your free time, if you’re not very busy rotating in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That evening in college I was sitting at lunch alone; then someone kicked me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English, who presented himself as a member of the University’s Conservative Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendly.
Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of sympathizing with conservatives will be mocked.
It’s not easy for me, but in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s going to be harder for you.
Most first-class conservatives pretend to be Labourists.”
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to hypocrite.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick failed.
A student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied at Iton, said, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious.”
Other students picked up his words.
I was broken, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex? – One of them asked.
“They cheat each other, aren’t they?”
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the abolition of prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with the like-minded only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourist and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of her speakers.
He hardly appeared in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I moved to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends in the capital.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He did not believe me.
During his studies in the forty years there were accepted any political views.
“But this is the best university in the world,” he said complainingly.
There is no such thing, except not in the city of sleeping spires.
Even my communist friends always behaved impeccably.”
His wet eyes blurred.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I am sure it is just a joke.
You’ll break my heart if you quit college.”
I was exhausted by constant trips to London and my emotional defense weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, did not withstand the pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
The next week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me “the enemy of the people” very seriously, I decided to do the same.
Burning in my soul of shame, I confessed that “my parents were brainwashed,” and called them “old fools.”
The rest was not long.
The last nail in the cover of my Oxford career’s grave was destined to be struck by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdoch’s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn’t go out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I picked up my suitcases and got on the first train to London.
I have never returned.
You can call me a puppy and a puppy.
But at eighteen, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in a school.
Even more sad, it was Oxford, which not only released the fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, but still hides behind the unmerited reputation of a university that values equality and free-thinking.
Valentino prefers elegance to fame.
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nattie Abascal, Fiona Tisen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of a Valentino Garvani exhibition.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashioned dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Il Signore" Garvani, but it could not have been written without his renowned clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, is full of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agah Khan to Lord Snowden, including Mary-Shanthal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest plunder from the city of Vogue in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with it.
“They don’t even quench their cigarette smoke on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tyssen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming to his hall in Gstaad,” explains Haini’s ex-wife, Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Angelou or Evgenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Despite that, he is a star.
Valeria Macca representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Macca recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his home, it was after a fashion show at Spain Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in food, in music.
“Each guest Valentino felt important and loved,” recalls the top model, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of Families
The life of Garvani is not a story of obsessions, but love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-meter-long podium that offers a shift of roles: the visitor takes the role of the models and has to defile on the podium contemplating the “spectators” of the grass that shine with Valentino’s masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Whitti used in “Nights,” or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of models shine such names as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nathan Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember him very well.
These were pants, shirts, jerseys and jackets from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nattie Abascal, one of the designer’s musees.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," she added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them and they fit into his face.
Proportions are ideal.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia Della Giovanni d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed up for Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
That time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a shirt with curtains, a "corsage" in fold and a cut without blades.
“It was a dream that became a reality,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dress from a fashion designer with "maximum care...because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that accompany him."
The King of Fashion
The grand final of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls his seams) to make this costume of silk in the color of ivory with pearl incrustation, twelve kinds of different hooks and a four-and-a-half-meter shelf.
According to journalist Suzie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the higher world."
Defeated for many years by the elite's "life style", Valentino himself is now its best representative.
Knight of the Great Cross (the distinction mark of the highest rank in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garvani collected as many honors as any of his clients.
"My attention has always been attracted by his sophistication, his calmness, his careful and impeccable appearance," Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a solemn dinner at the Orsa Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
“He was impeccable, time does not exist for him.”
When the princess says that...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of a volcano along steep rocky paths.
There are people for whom their job is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them is Antó Vidjaja, one of the 400 miners who make a living by mining sulfur in the Kawah-Ijjen volcano on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Antho descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when it comes into contact with air.
Having cut out huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them upward along a crumbling rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, however, exhausted cargoers take more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, hardly keeping balance and carefully tapping the road, so as not to back down and fall from the breach.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as it happened to a tourist from France who crashed a few years ago from the rocks of Kawah-Ijen.
Miners from Kawah-Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once on the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, step three kilometers to the weights that the mining company placed just above, at the height of 1,850 meters.
It’s about Pt Candy Ngrimby, an enterprise that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make fireworks, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each move,” explains Antó, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
While it seems miserable for such an inhumane effort, it’s three times as much as he’d earn in the field.
“The miners’ salary is very high by local standards, where they pay 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day for collecting coffee and the average monthly earnings are two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the carrier, who previously worked as a stone maker on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot wasn’t that heavy, but Antó returned with his family to Banyewangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as gray: “I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, constantly coughing, and he has tearful eyes due to toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Antó spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he constantly coughs, and he has tearful eyes due to the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
That’s the price he has to pay to his dream.
“I’ll work for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and clever young man could be a tour guide, waitress, or hotel portier, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing the dirty wooden cabin with other carriers, he wakes up every day at two o’clock at night, because the sulfur does not stop flowing out at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Antó descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
Around 400 carrier carriers pull baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get a portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for photography, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guard of this reserve charges tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-mules.
“This is a job for cattle, not for people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old rooted carrier who has spent three decades in Kawah-Ijen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate the work "as much as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so enduring that no one complains about their severe illnesses... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain, and shoulder ulcers that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamanzari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow trail among the grains.
“I will not retire, I will die here, because a volcano is my whole life,” says Unnik, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Ijen do.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and the price of housing and education for the lack of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, we will fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of a butterfly ad, but despite this — or because of it — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like “Let’s put a bao in the oven” to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill “their national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was the topic we needed to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
1.2 The child
Whoever does not take this so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
All of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – which is known as a replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Policy Department at the National Population Administration, says the reason for this is “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family-building," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in the number of single couples and the postponement of marriages and childbirth, resulting in lower birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the population decline, is provoking outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a barely hidden xenophobia towards many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized forining low wages and reluctance to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party got its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem by quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a certain impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small houses.
For example, this is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can promote a solitary lifestyle and deprive developers of the incentive to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, chief executive of EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than the more spacious ones.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously barred if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have a particular effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this many people postpone it," says the young governor.
Others may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the price of housing and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbirth, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Personal in Offline - Personal in Online
and confidentiality .
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is a property of private or “a sphere of private life that they have the right to protect from any interference.”
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing online situations that he’t share outside of the internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five young people from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four instances, they associated the term with "something very my", in a personal plane, and "password and user name" when they applied it to social media.
“I’t post my biggest secrets,” says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the importance of being personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games on FB.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who behaves stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post nasty photos of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 of his FB friends and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they respond to me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends in a faster way,” he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I would not count on someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he said.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they press me or demand me, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friend was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and extortioned.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
“Just included confidentiality.”
It then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yes, I would do it if someone doesn’t like me or if I want to.
“Al I know it’s cyberbullying,” he confirms.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy from Yale University and author of the paper Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are children and young people born in the era of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complex “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at an age when maturity is not enough for it.”
“They should also be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do this is useless,” she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or would you like to be posted a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
Do you need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside of the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should it be in social media,” she says.
vigilantly
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, primary education professor and educational consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good grounds to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,” he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without the announcement of the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the VI meeting of heads of state and government of the UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that at a certain point it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
Asked about the text, they pointed out that the content was outlined by Peruvian President Olivia Umala during brief press releases.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited all the time.
During the day only was broadcast, in the press room, video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "closed session, sound prohibited".
Few of the information that circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian.
The only document spread over the course of the day was a list of participating presidents, which sparked the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent a media email with the summit’s “final declaration”, but it was a statement by Umala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the press’s insistence, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not spread.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Olivia Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the statements of both sides, as part of the charges that Lima raised against Santiago.
"We will observe and enforce a decision that will clarify the disagreements we are currently presenting to this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Pineera added, welcoming Umala with a handshake against the background of the two countries' flags.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will obey the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized obedience to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it found wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in the UNASUR was suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Olya Umar, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later in the afternoon at Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and directions of action were approved on 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of planned investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence."
He said that action is being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizens' uncertainty and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, affordable internet access in all corners of South America, and taking into account the risks of natural disasters in a combined and effective way."
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities," Umar added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connectivity of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited by cross-axis on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbors was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombia’s President, Juan Manuel Santos, said before joining the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to conduct respectful negotiations on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogota.
"After tomorrow, I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are expected to attend the inauguration of the new president of the country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
In the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met preliminarily to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
South America should learn from Europe on citizenship integration: Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are virtually one homeland."
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the UNASUR member countries.
“It is necessary to the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the Andes, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has shown himself, in addition, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never take on any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is unexplained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with him he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at one time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be observed."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for requiring it to arrive on its territory for an interrogation regarding the alleged sexual offence, while “only Swedish law considers it possible to perform it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating Assange's physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What really exists is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to tightness in a small space without the ability to do exercise in the air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of inviolability that will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there have been talks in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garson, is conducting a series of trials in various European instances,” he said.
He said that “if Britain gives a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits it, and as it has already done in other cases, question Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or question him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to show himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "medianism, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression."
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "neither the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemon countries dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported Paraguay's decision to retain its veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coup d'etat under the mask of legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "completely justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate now with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which proved in favor of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not observed.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the dispute on maritime borders, which Peru and Chile are in the same court, and said that "it is correct for Latin America to appeal to international instances if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he said that he is considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa has assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement thought it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If we win, this would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, it is the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an exacerbation of President Chavez's health," he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was announced that his AIDS test was positive.
"I felt like I was stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite the whole tacit of the doctor, moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much about it as possible.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "Human Immunodeficiency Virus" (HIV) for 22 years.In the early 1990s, it would be difficult to believe this - too few treatment options existed, too little was known about the disease, too prejudiced to patients.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection clinic did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without deteriorating the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about their illness, so far many people come when the virus has already done damage, "exhausted" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the AIDS outbreak in the world, at least after the first cases, “the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,” said HCG’s head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious scientist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but life expectancy and quality depend on the degree of damage to the immune system present in patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in non-drug users: up to 30 years with 200 CD4s, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4s are.
Simply put, the above means that a person who gets a diagnosis of being HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “will be able to live up to 75 years without problems byining control,” he explained.
To evaluate this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNEDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Haliko alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still fatalities?
I personally think that the problem is not access to treatment.
I think that’s what happens in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they are unaware of their infected state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a large scale, for all people who will ask for it.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Haliko (COESIDA) agree, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for examination only motivated by the fact that it was done by his friend and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die anyway, I’m better off fighting three times a week,” they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medications.
So far, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
“I work, I do a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to promote his statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, experiencing fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them learn that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of fighting AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shelf
There are big gaps between health programs and the common citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who dealt with the HIV-related issue.
The biggest is prevention.
In places devoted to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why are they you?" is a popular question, with echoes and condemnations, from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy employees and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not just behind the shelves and that a hundred of them be in machines in public toilets in places that are frequently visited by young people.
This is not an encouragement of disintegration.
It’s not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzales replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisco
13,435 total cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) were recorded.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections relate to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are 4 to 5 people who are unaware of it.
Given the U.S. Court of Appeal’s ratification of the decision to cancel the Vitro Group’s debt restructuring achieved through Mexican insolvency proceedings, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the endorsement of the judge Harlin Hale’s decision of June 15 at the Northern District Bankruptcy Court in Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizure of their assets on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the case judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings relate to the bankruptcy proceedings being considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without inter-corporate voting, the debts recognized in the critical mass of the competitive production that Vitro branches had before the parent company would not have achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition Proceedings.
It is also true that by deducting the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely, the “scorpion funds” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
This data is ignored by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 as a result of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States by striking the country.
For now, the company of the Gonzales Sad family will appeal the decision to the appeal court itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
In case of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require the process to be reviewed by the highest court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is relieving itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to bind it to Article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambole from two sides: they hit in Vitro and hit in the country.
The overall balance
Given the months-long complaints put on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the company’s former owner, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Aviation Pilots’ Union has already discovered a bottle throat.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic regarding the transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the trust fund F/589 of IXE Bank 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The funds would be used to buy shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascaraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Around the Dragon Mart
Gathered at a weekend forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have leveled with the ground part of the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government's rejected Senate demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been filed.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, home developer Homex places on the market Stock Exchange Certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer of paying interest every 28 days.
Competition comes to light.
Formed by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, IT leaders, the Competival consortium has just emerged, aiming to market software cluster services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hattin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The busy basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball stories in mind as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a cerebral hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for over 60 years, as a small-category player, a Higher Basketball League player, BSN Commissioner and Head of Cowboys Bayamon and President of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played a lot of basketball roles throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was BSN president, National Team CEO and Federation President in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamoon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate in making this claim.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable items collected during his long journey, testify to this.
Bayonne in the Heart
With the greatest emotions he holds those who remember his way through Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were my best years, which I the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, co-agent, or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minnie’s debut at BSN.
From that moment onwards, Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the head of Kuko,” Reyes said.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was going here and was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me, “I have a very strong player for you, 6’7 in height.”
“Do you want?”
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players that have been with Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minnie brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped to win another.
I the Cowboys and Gauss championship, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minnie in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it should have been bronze if it wasn’t for the Canadian referee who made us overtake the final game, Reyes said.
The team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you’ve ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
In that team not only played again Minnie, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortiz), but also young (Havier) 'Tonyito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of staff, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like ‘Canito’ Neves, Pablo Alise and the young Roland Hurruiter in exchange for players temporarily suspended for disorder at the Pan-American Championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level like Piculin did.
And that doesn’t take into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What do you still have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, let the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that’s unnecessary.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his lead role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil-predator magnate J. A. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died Friday evening from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas again, playing the iconic role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at a Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, fun, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted he had been drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Long before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television thanks to his role of a decent type in the lightweight comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles in “The Group”, “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors”.
But it was his masterpiece interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who Shoot J.R.?”, designed to create a noise around an emotional episode in which Hagman’s character is almost killed, has sparked international discussions and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When the response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million TV viewers watched it and turned the Dallas into the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the MASH final in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (performed by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. hindered her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
He played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed on treatment.
“I know what must be on the J.R’s grave plate,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, “Here rests the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
It was the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone “big, both on and off the screen.”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new release of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will be with the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Hyde, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything that I thought could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he started advocating organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go for surgery, and after," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort like, “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you’ll be okay.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores the "end of the world" begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible trick: the end of the "long countdown" of the Maya calendar, December 21, which many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what would be ahead of him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “Long Armageddon,” and the growing conflict that will involve Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was really a good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on “the end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Walker is reading a course on “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time,” he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios provoking certain human actions are suggested.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell students what is possible, probably plausible, and impossible,” Waker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, joined forces to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in case the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students have to study, prepare projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night when the end of the world is supposed to come," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The seats ended in two hours," Restall said of his high-average student course, where 35 students enrolled.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there were still spaces.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Hudsonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Veques, a 25-year-old student at the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he has watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed – not to mention the professor – said they believe in the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affected the Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has been around for centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused this speculation to rise.
“In other places, people don’t think about it,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at a higher instance’s order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment have been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to go to the “end of the world” party.
“Maybe I’ll call some of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
