The members of the Welsh Assembly were worried that they would be seen as 'puppets'
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposed renaming of MWPs (Member of the Welsh Assembly).
This proposal arose because of a change in plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the Assembly are worried that he could become a laughing stock in the political arena.
One of the assembly workers said that his group was worried because the name was being reduced to Twp and Pwp.
For those of you outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means crazy, and pwp means weep.
A member of the Assembly's Plaid Cymru party says the group is "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative says his group is "anonymous" about the name change, but notes that the transformation of Welsh MPs into apes was a short leap of verbal thought.
In this context, the Welsh w (w) is pronounced like the u (u) in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing to introduce legislation on name changes, said: "The final decision on any designation of the members of the Assembly should of course be the business of the members.
The Welsh Government gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name by an Act of 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received strong support for the Assembly, the Welsh Parliament.
The Assembly (AMs) were backed by the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP received the most support from the council.
The House members are apparently proposing alternatives, but the battle to reach an agreement could prove a headache for incumbent Speaker Elaine Jones, who is likely to introduce a bill of amendments in a matter of weeks.
Legislation on legislative amendments will also include other changes to the Assembly's working style, including the rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will get a final vote on what they will be called when the legislation is considered.
Macedonians have launched a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This popular vote was supposed to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a state named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory, and has applied to the EU and NATO for membership.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, the opponent of the referendum on anonymity, said he would cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the renaming is merely a reward for joining the EU and NATO.
As tensions between the churches in Harlem grew, St. Martin's bells fell silent
"The adults I've talked to say that historically, there was a coffee shop and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
None of them are there today.
He said that the disappearance of coffee shops was understandable.
"In our time, people communicate in different ways", he said.
Cafes are no longer the living rooms of the neighbors that people frequent on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he's worried that the revenue from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll be back where they started.
"Churches", he added, "can be replaced by residential buildings of congregations, filled with people who will not help the sanctuaries that remain in their neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who move into these houses will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before the 1870 Metropolitan Community of Harlem became the black capital, and a decade later St. Martin's was built.
In the 1930s, the real white Methodist Conference was out.
The Black Assembly, which the neighborhood worshipped, became the name of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by black conventionists led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the 125th Street Boycott of Harlem's main shopping streets, and who was against hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's old people planned to rebuild it, they were commissioned to procure the bells.
St. David Jones, the son of Father Johnson and the rightful heir of St. Martin's, proudly calls the bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bells in July called them something else: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical tool".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan researcher, also noted that it was the world's first bell, made by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who replaced a bell with a larger one 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's been going on around St. Martin's over the last few months is a confused story between architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, some brought in by the Episcopal Church.
The Leaders' Council, the church's governing body, wrote in July that it was concerned about "trying to avoid cost", despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors.
Some church members complained about the lack of transparency on the topic.
Shark in California injured 13-year-old boy who dived to catch shrimp
On Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who had been diving on the opening day of the California shark season, the official release said.
The attack took place between 7am and 7am, off the coast of Encinitas, Bacon.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help. He and the group headed for the boy to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a shrimp, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I've been bitten".
- I was bit.
"His shirt was torn", said Hamel, "and he only noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water!" "There's a shark in the water!" added Hamel.
He was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked was unknown.
At a press conference, rescue boat captain Larry Gilson said the shark had been in the area for several weeks, but was not considered an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed the entrance to the Ecinia Coast from Casablanca Ponto to Swam for 48 hours for research and security.
Gilles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's plans are being imported into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is a beauty salon for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, along with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial £2.8 billion infusion into the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home goods sales decline, the big beauty salons will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will move to more stores next year.
The focus on beauty came when supermarkets started looking for ways to leverage the space of televisions, microwaves, and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double in size to offer up to 3,000 beauty products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get branded larger spaces, as in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-branding its storefront makeup so that most of the products are plant-based, which is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other last year in Sell Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping, and the shift to buying small quantities of food at convenience stores on a daily basis, means that supermarkets have a lot to do to get people to come to them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coope noted that retail outlets will be seen as "unicamerals" as the supermarket chain tries to fight off retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and no food.
Sainsbury established Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitats brands until it bought both networks two years ago, which, in its own words, boosted the sales of its grocery products and made its acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
In early 2000, Sainsbury attempted to form a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended in a dispute over how to share the revenues from their supermarket drugstores.
The new strategy was created after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Seelesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyd was expected to play a major role in the scheme by adding a luxury skin care line to the four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's chief commercial officer Paul Mills-Hick said, "We've redesigned our beauty salons and given them a different flavor, enhancing the aesthetics for our customers.
We also invested and trained special partners who were able to advise.
Our brand portfolio is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment, as well as the convenient location, means that we are now a magnet for beauty accessories, which in turn challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones was sacked after the £11 million deal with Holly Wilba
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left out of the equation when presenter Holly Willby walked out of her lifestyle business for £11 million to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wilbaugh didn't have time to work on the housewares brand Truly.
The couple's business was like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Wilby left the lucrative lifestyle business with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones at the last minute to focus on her new, large-scale contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "laughing" when the TV golden girl announced her new deal of £1.5 million and more at their business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, meaning she no longer had enough time to give their home clothes and accessories to the Truly brand.
The business was modelled after Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aimed at doubling Wilba's £11 million in the future.
When 37-year-old Willbay announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
"Truly" was the top priority for Holly.
That's going to be his long-term future, which is what we're going to see in the next few decades.
Her decision to come out was definitely a shock.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe's head full of merchandise ready to be sold.
Experts are confident that the This Morning presenter, considered one of Britain's richest stars, will cost the company millions due to massive investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, as well as delays in further launch.
And that could spell the end of a long-standing partnership.
The Wilbains' mother of three and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Knapp, for about ten years.
Wilby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became president in March.
The husband and wife are relaxing together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in the Baldwin TV production company.
Wilby was to become an M&S brand ambassador and was to replace Ant McPartly as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a close friend of Jones said, "We don't comment on his business dealings".
After a difficult conversation, we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for a comment that many would consider "un-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so giving up?
Trump, in his typical mocking news anchor voice, said,
- I didn't give you anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second summit, after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, when Trump called North Korea's denuclearization a big step.
But the denuclearization talks were suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see an appropriate US response to the North's urgent disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in an effort to maintain tensions.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
We have a great relationship with Hu Jia-Chen.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship", he said.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests were completed, the release of overseas hostages was aided, and finally, American servicemen were home.
And she maintained her unusual approach to talking to Kim about relationships.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded space, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, claiming hundreds of lives
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national pandemic was declared, which would be a precursor to international humanitarian aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it's pretty clear that they're not going to ask for international assistance, so it's a little bit complicated", Ms. Sambog said.
While Save the Children is recruiting a team to travel to Palu, they are still not sure that the foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials had assessed the situation in Palau to ascertain whether international agencies would be allowed to carry out charity events.
Given that Indonesia is constantly being hit by shocks, however, the country remains unprepared for the elements.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aché, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami signal or even warning in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make supplying much more difficult.
A relief ship based in Lambock, which was providing aid to the earthquake victims, has been heading to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's fragile infrastructure the most important condition of his election campaign, as well as spending money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is a concern for Mr Yoko's administration, as he is up for re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also has problems with inter-church tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 people were forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups clashed in the streets, using guns, spears, bows and other crude weapons.
Look at that. Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool tied the game against Chelsea.
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League game against Chelsea.
Starig received the ball from Khedran Shakir 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team were losing 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before it hit the goal.
The test shot was a little bit higher than the goal as it went through the top right of the goal.
Finally, the ball went down the side of Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was bouncing, and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get in that position to get the ball, but players like Shaq always get there as soon as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible for myself", Starije told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I touched the ball a little bit, didn't think much about it, and I just hit it.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 when Belgian Eden Hazard opened the scoring in the 25th minute.
In that game, before the Blues striker could reach the centre of the field and capture the Liverpool goal from a short distance, the ball was sent back to Mateo Kovacic.
The quarterback made a fast back and forth pass in the center of the field.
Then he made a great goal against Hazard.
Hazard came off the bench and completed the attack at left-back, passing the ball to Liverpool's Alison Baker.
On Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League.
On Thursday at 15:00 in London, Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
On Sunday morning, the country's disaster relief agency said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
During a press conference, the agency's press secretary, Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, said that many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, with waves reaching 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing and killing a woman
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging anyone who saw or heard anything in the area to contact them.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who witnessed or heard anything suspicious in the Brickenhead area of John Street to get in touch with us.
I'm appealing to everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have picked up something with their VCRs, to contact us if they have information that is critical to the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed the identity of the woman whose body was found at her home in Birkenhead.
At noon today, friends who knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where they found the body this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have said they are in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews was trying to get back to his apartment, but police said that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He fainted when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that it would be hours before they were allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, crying.
He kept saying how horrible it was.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the cordon and another outside.
A few policemen were standing inside the cordon, guarding the apartments.
We ask anyone with information about the incident to contact us by personal email @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call the Crime Prevention Center at 080055111 by calling 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's half-word in Parliament, "re-writing history for controversy", becomes the historical last hit
His deportation would be poetic justice to the destruction of the cultural and spiritual art of England by his moorish Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Union described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate on the removal of statues outside the Palace of Westminster is bound to become a target for Oliver Cromwell's demagogy.
The ideas of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor instigated by Cromwell.
Perhaps, in the last century, the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed as a result of the actions of his predecessor Thomas.
Sir William Humo Tronicroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's sense of history and a figure that many still admire.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell is revered by many, certainly more in the late 19th century than today, as the protector of Parliament from outside pressures, in his own case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate reproduction or not, it is still subject to ongoing historical debate.
Significantly, the conflict of the mid-17th century charted the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as a lord-defender are also worthy of appreciation and mention.
A killer pig brutally kills a Chinese farmer
Local media reports in China say a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern market.
The South China Morning Post reports that a man named Yuan was found dead on Sunday at Liupanshi Market in the suburb of Gichou, his lungs cut off and covered in blood.
A farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in the suburb of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he went with his cousin to the neighboring suburb of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door to the neighboring barn was open.
He said that there was a huge male pig in the pigsty with a mouth full of blood.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig caused the death of the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News quotes a cousin, whose name is Wu, as saying, "My cousin's knees were bloody and bruised".
Security cameras captured Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered an hour later.
The beast that killed John belonged neither to him nor to his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that no one would be attacked until the police had collected evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and the market management are negotiating compensation for his death.
In the past, there were rare cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was driven onto a Welsh farmer's tractor, until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs. A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News, "Pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can make them sick".
They just like to play.
They're like babies, they're curious, they won't hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of attention.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwestern United States
As predicted, moving over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico, Hurricane Rosa is subduing.
Anyway, in the next few days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5:00 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday morning, Rosa was an 85-mile hurricane, or Category 1 storm, located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a hurricane is forming over the Pacific, and it's starting to move from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it's going to bring humidity from the north to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the Jordan, will produce massive torrential rains in the southwest over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches of rain on a local scale can cause flooding, landslides and possible landslides.
The deep tropical humidity will cause 2-3 inches of rain per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible in a dramatic deterioration of weather conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely bad advice to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain coming.
Heavy rain can turn waterways into rivers, and thunderstorms bring high winds and dust.
The approaching hurricane will cause heavy rainfall in coastal areas of Southern California.
Half an inch of rain, possibly causing small rock flows and road slides.
This will be the first heavy rainfall in the region this wet season.
Some tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before rain becomes more common on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on Tuesday in all four corners and continue until Wednesday.
In the United States, you may see some intense temperature changes in October, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay pretty warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of this is the extreme temperature changes in the central United States on Sunday.
There's about a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to spread again.
October in the central and eastern United States is expected to start off mild, with temperatures of around 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
Tuesday in New York City can be as hot as 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Based on our long-term climate forecasts, there's a strong chance that we'll have above-average weather in the eastern half of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearings
On Thursday, more than 20 million people across six television networks watched the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blais Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, as the political standoff continued, when the broadcasters pulled the regular broadcast at the last minute on Friday, Arizona Senator Jeff Blake reached an agreement that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) should conduct a week-long audit of the expenses.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had drunk and attacked him and tried to take off his shirts at a high school graduation.
Kavanaugh enthusiastically testified that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen, it was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of views for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that showed it, the ratings were not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the statistics of people watching from the office.
In this sense, the number of viewers is the same as the number of viewers of a football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose public opinion guests have strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, leads all networks with an average of 5.9 million daily viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN was at 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, interest remained high.
In the tragedy of Friday, Flake was the center of attention.
After the Republican caucus announced it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras were pointed at the protesters on Friday morning as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing room.
And he stood there for a few minutes, looking down at the ground, because he felt so badly.
- I'm standing right in front of you.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"You have power when many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office had sent out a message and before the doors of the elevator closed, he said he would have a lot more to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was to inform the Senate of the nomination vote for Kavanaugh.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would be investigating the charges against the candidate next week, which was what the Democratic minority wanted.
Flake was convinced in part after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Quincy and later to many other senators, Flake made his decision.
The election of Flake had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have a vote to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames Brexit on criticism of the political game
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, blames criticism of her plans to leave the European Union and national interests for playing politics.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham, UK, to attend the Conservative Party conference.
On the front page of the paper, in another interview with him, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson voiced his dissatisfaction with his so-called Brexit checker plan, outlining his proposal that Britain and the EU should join forces to be "fully prosperous".
Police have arrested Dayton Simpson in connection with the death of a LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
According to a news release from the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
The video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson has been officially released, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, police recovered the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to his crime.
According to the lawyer's statement, his share was worth $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge County District Attorney's Office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern Police College, and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alevan thanked the area's law enforcement for their "dedication and commitment to justice".
Sims was twenty years old.
He was very tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "terrified and shocked" by the news of Wade's death.
"That's what's been bothering you", Wade said.
The volcano spread gray smoke across Mexico
Smoke from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
After the volcano's eruption on Saturday, which produced 183 types of gas in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The center was monitoring many tremors and shocks.
Images posted on social media from the neighboring Mexican city of Jojimilco show thin layers of smoke covering the masks of the cars.
Beginning with a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck central Mexico in September 2017, geologists have been detecting activity near the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands of people joined the opposition demonstrators to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of separatists, masked by the police, sprayed them with snow and ink dust, creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets that constantly disturbed tourists.
Later in the day, clashes with the police resumed, using police carpet to fight back.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanting "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" clashed with Democratic conservatives shouting "Long live Spain!"
Fourteen people with minor injuries sustained during the protest have been treated, according to local media.
Tensions in the newly independent region were heightened a year ago when the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters will vote for independence, although there was a low turnout among those who voted against the demolition and a high turnout among those who boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop voting in the area.
On Friday night, pro-independence groups came out to stop the demonstration, with the help of the National Police.
Progress was being made, but the march had to take a different direction.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was with his wife at the separatist protest, said he no longer sees any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck", she said.
Despite a narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties were fighting to hold onto the fortunes this year, with their best leaders locked up or imprisoned as a result of the independence referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in the preliminary trial since last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of popular values and repression that I have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners arrested after car crashes in home
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested when a car crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred on Thursday in Belinagar Crescent at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Division Supervisor Bob Blemings said there was damage to the doors and the building itself.

In the match against Rangers, Menga's shot brought a 1-0 victory to Livington
Dolly Mangan's first goal secured the win for Livington
Livington's promotion shocked Rangers, handing Steven Gerrard to Ibrox's club manager, causing his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mangan's punch seemed to be different for Gary Holt, reaching Hibernia in the second level.
This season, Gerrard's side have been denied a win in the Premier League, and next Sunday they face Hart, who are eight points behind.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, Rapid Vienna hosted Rangers in the Europa League.
Livingston, who had been unbeaten in six games under head coach Holt, was still on the losing side until he was replaced by Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston unleashed his potential to the bewildered visitors.
Before the goal, Holt's team would have been in front, causing a lot of problems for Rangers with their immediacy.
Scott Robinson went ahead, sparing no effort to score, then Alan Lithgohn was able to direct all his efforts to a wide shot, meeting Craig Holcert's head shot.
The receiving side was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they could cause discomfort to visitors in certain areas.
And that's exactly how the winning goal was scored.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston worked towards the opening goal. Declan Gallagher and Robinson attempted to block Menghi, who received the ball and hit the goal from the centre.
At this stage, the Rangers were dominant and their goalkeeping was invincible, while goalkeeper Liam Kelly was invincible.
That style of play was maintained into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos broke Kelly's safety.
Scott Pittman was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Ligo was kicked by another Livingston player.
After two penalties, one for replacing Holketh with Glem Middleton and the other for a hand-off, the cross-attacks at Livingston's goal continued to be pushed backwards.
"It was phenomenal", says an analysis by Livingstone.
Alasdair Lamont for the BBC Scotland broadcast from the Tony McCarron Arena
Amazing game and result for Livingston.
According to one person, they were excellent, continuing to exceed their expectations.
After moving up, their playing style and roster has changed significantly, but the credit goes to Holt, as the team has rebounded since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was doing a great job of building a strong defense, and in the meantime, Menga was keeping a close eye on Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers' inspiration was short-lived.
As good as they played Gerard, they didn't meet the standard.
Their last-ball absence and their one-off loss was a wake-up call for Rangers to get in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue clouds on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at normalizing relations between the NATO allies.
They discussed a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening of a huge mosque.
This city is home to a large ethnic Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police had secured the mosque to block the entrance to the 25,000-strong crowd, but many supporters were able to see their president at close range.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him into the country.
The fiery protests reflected the inadequacy of the hero's reception by some German Turks and the slander of the self-styled visitor.
A motorcyclist has died after being hit by a car on Deptford Road
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred at 10:15 local time on the busy Deptford Road in the south-east of the city, at the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets.
The driver of the car stopped, and in the presence of witnesses, the man died at the scene.
The accident happened on Childers Road, about a mile away from Saturday's crash, a month after another cyclist was killed.
The Metropolitan Police said they are working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus routes have been rerouted and drivers are being advised to avoid the area.
In the meantime, the police are working on the case.
Six officers were injured in a disturbance during the trial of a man held in a male maximum security prison, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out at Long Larthy Prison in Worcestershire at 0930 hours local time on Sunday and have continued to this day.
A special Tornadot squad of assassins was brought in to quell the riots, eight prisoners from the same wing were involved.
Sapan was treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Special trained prison staff have been brought to Long Lart to calm the ongoing unrest.
Six crew members were treated.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be arrested and put behind bars for a long time.
Long Lartree has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was receiving hospital treatment for an attack by an inmate.
And last October, the police were called to the prison to clean up a serious disturbance, during which the staff were attacked with swimming pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (the locations of the monsoon may be of benefit)
For a tropical cyclone, hitting Arizona is rare, but that's what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa will be blasted into the Southwest Desert, potentially causing flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with evening showers.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind status within 200 miles of Phoenix.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was moving 40 miles into the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, up to 6 inches of individual rainfall in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including Rocky and the Great Basin, are likely to get one to two inches of water, possibly four inches separately.
For areas that have been spared from flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is at risk of drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, these rains are likely to be beneficial for Southwest, which is currently under the threat of drought.
According to a report from US weather.com: "Drought monitoring indicates that more than 40 percent of Arizona is at risk of a major category six drought".
Initially, Hurricane Rosa's path leads from the Baja Peninsula in Mexico to the coast.
Rosa, still strong Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is heading south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and north at 12 mph.
The wind is swaying over the cold waters of the Pacific, and therefore its power is increasing.
So, it's expected to land in Mexico by midday or evening on Monday due to an upcoming tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the rains will be heavy, which could cause serious flooding.
As reported by weather.com, 3-6 inches of rain are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches.
Rosa will then cross northern Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and then cross Arizona late Tuesday night and reach southern Utah.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwest Desert in the United States", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and rivers in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Attack on Mithsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
On Saturday, at around 04:00 local time, the boy was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace, which is located in North Mittsommer.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was assessed as "stable".
Avon and Somerset Police say two 17- and 18-year-olds and a man in his 20s were arrested in the Redstone area on the same night.
Police have urged anyone who may have a phone recording of the incident to contact them immediately.
Trump says Kavanaugh is a victim of the Democratic Party's "enrichment, anger"
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party's reckless and dishonorable tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been a victim of Democratic Party "power and anger" throughout his candidacy.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress in a strong and emotional rebuttal to Christine Blessing Ford's baseless accusation that he sexually assaulted her years ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial after hearing about his accusation.
On Saturday, the president said, "The Americans witnessed the intelligence, the character, and the courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to elect Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to elect one of the most brilliant legal thinkers of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant knowledge of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
During the midterm elections, the president hinted at Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of the Republican convention.
We have five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
I'm not nominating, but I'm actually nominating.
That's why I fight so hard for the good candidates", she said.
Trump claimed that Democrats have a mandate to "resist and oppose".
A spokesman for the leadership of the grand old party (the Republican Party) told CNN that Kavanaugh's first major Senate election is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people became victims of the Indonesian shock and tsunami ∀ along with the deterioration of visibility
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed Saturday by a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with many swept away by huge waves that washed ashore.
Hundreds of people gathered on a beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate the festival, when a six-meter (18-foot) wave hit the beach and washed away the bodies of people, destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
During a briefing in Jakarta, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster mitigation company BNPB, said that yesterday, when the tsunami alert was raised, people continued to do their duty on the beach and instead did not flee the scene, which resulted in them becoming victims.
"The tsunami itself didn't come, it swept away cars, buildings, houses, it hit everything on the land", said Nugroho, adding that before it hit the coast, the tsunami had been moving across the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palau.
Aerial photos released by the Aerial Photographers of the Dead show many destroyed houses and shops, destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Tremors continued to hit the coastal areas on Saturday.
The tremors were felt in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Organization for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
It is said that the city's geographical location, lying on the edge of a long, narrow inlet, could have further increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the bodies of the victims were found under the rubble of the buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nughroho said that the casualties and destruction could be greater in the watershed area 300 km north of Palu in an area called Dongola, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication in Dongala was "a total lack of information", said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that staff and volunteers were being directed to the affected areas.
They say it's a tragedy, but it could have been worse.
On Sunday, the organization was heavily criticized for not being aware of the tsunami in Palu, even though officials said the waves had hit before the warning was in place.
In a fan recording that has been leaked online, a man can be heard in an attic screaming warnings of a tsunami to the people in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking buildings and cars in its wake.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a tremendous power surge, making communications impossible in the vicinity of Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to send coordinates to rescue teams.
Authorities say the military has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities in cargo planes, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened to rescue forces only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
-The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
That's too bad.
As the staff of World Vision's office in Dongola safely reached Palu, where the workers are sheltering in the tar hutts installed in the courtyard of their offices, they witnessed scenes of destruction on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
That's too bad.
Even as relief groups began the brutal process of installing disaster relief equipment, some complained that foreign relief workers, who were better informed, had been prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, assistance and staffing can only be started after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered a provincial-level disaster", said Oula Ariyani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can get international help, but we don't have the right to do that yet.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palau on Friday, the families and friends of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that had been so painfully taken away by the natural disasters.
On the Sabbath a man was brought out of the water.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with her mother's body.
Jendron Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paratroop team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers ahead of the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier that month.
The others at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi retired, were his students.
"As a paraplaning professional, I have my own emotional baggage", he said.
Mr. Jendn tells how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread in the surfing community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's rivals who were attending the beach party.
But his messages received only one grey checkmark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it's a sign that the messages haven't been received", he said.
In Newport Levy, the thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM while trying to load it.
According to a news report from Newport Police, the thieves stole $26750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport Levy on Friday morning.
The driver of the machine was emptying an ATM at an amusement park and was about to make more money in Detroit, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was doing that, another man ran after the Brink employee and stole the bag full of money that was to be delivered.
According to eyewitness accounts, he saw several suspects fleeing, but police did not say how many people were involved.
People with any information about their identities can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West, I'm a fan of Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the moniker Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change succeeds on Saturday night's live broadcast, where her new album "Yandine" was to be released.
"He's replacing Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance because of some emotional issues", said the show's host.
As well as being an acronym for his current name, West has stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big B.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It spread from K'nyi, which means just Yi, and became the reflection of our good, bad, regret, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are.
He's on the list of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has declared his preference for the names Sher and Hebrew Ser.
West's former partner, Jay-Z, also spelled his name with capital letters and dashes, or without them.
The Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday, at the Tlatelolco complex, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force to oppress Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration at the campus, killing nearly 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were widespread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly stipends to those who study and by establishing more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education create opportunities for young people to become gang members.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
"While China is becoming more active in AI, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on AI research", says Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI business expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have made statements about AI, while the US itself has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan, their goal to be the leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good start, considering that the U.S. is way ahead of most other countries, and we're looking forward to the next big thing in AI", said Lin.
In an interview this week, Lin told CNBC that doubling funding could double the next big achievement the US will achieve in artificial intelligence.
Li, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, whose book The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Field and the New World Order, was published this month by Hawthorn Mifflin Harcourt, has invested in one of China's largest artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence program that beat out the highest-rated American actor, Othello. He then became the CEO of Microsoft Research and the chairman of Google's China division.
Lin took on past U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Challenge, and asked when would be the next one to help identify the next inventors.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
"The academic leaders are not taken by China, but by the corporations", said Li.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired prominent academics from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lin said that changing the immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should immediately offer a writing card to the PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese National Council presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"China's National Natural Science Foundation funds individuals from academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", said Lin.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which is trying to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would help resolve a years-old dispute with Greece that has become a barrier to its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that naming its northern neighbor Macedonia means seizing its territory and barring it from NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June to agree on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov has announced that he will not participate in the vote, and there are doubts among the boycott campaigners whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for a referendum to be considered valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Do you support membership of NATO and the European Union and acceptance of the post-Greek deal?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price of full membership in NATO or the European Union for Macedonia, one of the countries that managed to survive the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, the future of the Macedonian youth, under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Oliviera Georgievski, 79, in Skopje.
Although it's not legally required, enough members of the House have said they will oppose the vote to make it final.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons.
The State Election Commission said there had been no reports of any irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 election, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gyose Tanesky in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filled in their ballots in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia, thus speeding up the country's path to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov was preparing a small stage and dragging chairs in front of tents set up by those opposed to the referendum.
We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but I want you to join them proudly, not from the service door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration", Kavarkarov said.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring great investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of NATO and the European Union", Zaev said after filling out his ballot.
He said that the answer would be "the guarantee of their prosperous future".
According to a poll released by the Institute for Political Studies in Macedonia on Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters voted in favor, which is below the required number of votes.
According to another poll by Telma TV, 57 percent of Macedonians are still planning to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the rally would be the first serious blow to the decency of the pro-Western government since last May.
Look at that, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has overcome all of Brighton's defence to put the ball in the net.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were released from Brighton's defence in a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Sunday.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute of the game seem easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the very beginning of the game.
He slipped through three of Brighton's defenders to make it to the free-field.
Aguero was then blocked by four green shirts.
He passed one, then passed several more before the Brighton gate.
Then he passed to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, having reached the goal, pushed the ball back to Aguero, who struck the ball with his right foot, giving it a direction towards Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, and the ball slipped towards the right corner of the goal.
"Aguero has some problems with his leg", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he could score at that moment.
However, Sky Blues have been given an early lead in the Premier League by Sterling.
That goal came in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got the ball in that game at Brighton.
He made a nice pass to Leroy Seyne on the left.
Shane made a few touches, then passed the ball to Sterling, who was on the other end of the court.
The Sky Blues put the ball in the goal before crossing the border.
City will take to the field in a Champions League friendly against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm EST, at the Rhein-Negar Arena in the German city of Sinchem.
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a surprise win.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no point in starting over.
The competitive-minded Scherzer hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it is possible to arrange a game with the Rockies, who will play the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least secured a spot in the playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they're still hoping to retain their division-leading title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, we can throw the ball, confident that the atmosphere and the crowd in Denver, as well as the opposing team, will be at the highest level I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?"
The Nationals are yet to announce the start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in a situation like this.
Scherzer, who was scheduled to make his 34th shot, threw the ball on Thursday and will return to his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2⁄3 innings this season.
Trump is a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly addressed the situation surrounding the election of his top council member Brett Kavanaugh during a speech on the importance of midterm elections in the Republican referendum.
Everything we've done will be at risk in November.
We have five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, biggest elections. I'm not running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm fighting so hard for good candidates", she said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see how it's happening now.
And they're willing to take back power at any cost, you see the craziness and the contempt.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they need, and we're not going to give it to them.
"The Democrats", he says, "have a mission to 'resist and resist.'"
And you see it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, rude, unethical and deceitful people".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's naming of Democrat Sean Dianne Feinstein, who received high applause from the audience.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a church.
It's very intolerant of people who express their thoughts.
When the Movement activists in my local party were criticizing me for being a "sweetheart", it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last person in the Labour Party line of MPs who could be told that we are not welcome here... and all because of our opinions.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was so determined to stand up against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I've been criticized by the dancers for contradicting Jeremy Corbyn.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironically, issues like this, Jeremy disagreed with his former leaders.
The notice for Friday's East Nottingham Labour Party meeting says: "We want meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the Friday GC meetings were like that.
Sadly, that is not the tone of many congregations today, and the policy of "good and honest" has long since been forgotten, if it ever was.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that everyone's opinion is viewed in terms of whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who I thought shared my political views began to expect me to change my views and to have views that I would never have agreed with otherwise... be it on national security or the EU single market.
I'm speaking in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, and then there's a barrage of insults on social media, calling for and postponing elections, condemning the politics of the centre and saying I have no right to be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made about me are political.
I'm amazed at the skill and determination of my colleagues who tolerate sexual or racial abuse every day, but never shy away from it.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is how the levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that expanded church, and every "no confidence" movement or change in election rules makes the party even more fragile.
I've been told many times over the last two years to keep my head down, not talk so much, and then I'll be fine".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, frustrated at being ignored by the Thatcher government, which had literally made my comprehensive school classroom decline, I have sought to provide better public services to those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never disguised my politics, and the last election was no exception.
No one in East Nottingham is confused by my political views and my differences with the current leadership.
All I'm going to say to those who are moving to start on Friday is this: when the country is moving towards Brexit, which will hurt the home economy, hurt businesses and hurt our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really my only statement is not to the Nottingham Moment, but to my supporters, whether they are Labour or not, I have proudly served you and I promise that no threat of re-election or political expectation will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38 to 17 Melrose the unstoppable Air is rising.
The last two attempts could have changed the final result in some way, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win on this day of great fun and excitement in the Tennant Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the top ten.
In the end, it was their superb defense and their success that gave the home side the victory, and coach Peter Murch had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tried in these games, but we haven't been beaten yet, so I should be happy", he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said, "Aprey Air, they've made better use of their opportunities than we have".
A 14-minute strike by Grant Anderson, passed by Frazier Hughes, pushed Ayres forward, but Rory Hughes's yellow card in the Scottish Cup against the Warriors gave Melrose a chance to add to the tally, and Jayson Baggott made an irreversible shot.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by a penalty, after half a time, he scored a point, then attempted a solo to make the score 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and a shot from Patrick Anderson, passed by Baggott, reduced the gap by five points.
There was a long break, caused by a serious injury to Ruard Nott, who was dropped and after a resumption, Ayr took the lead with a Stefford McDowell pass to Clymo.
Air's acting captain Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose made an extra strike thanks to Bruce Calvin at the end of the scorching pressure.
The hosts, however, came back, and when Sturgeon Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climie out of the penalty line without a ball, McPherson fell on the ball moving ahead of Ayr.
Climo struck as he started almost from the beginning again, after Kyle Rowe had stopped David Armstrong's stroke and sent flanker Gregor Henry away to stop the hosts' half-hitter.
The Still Game star is ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Keira is set to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he had become the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 59-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hampill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's last, and it has been revealed that Kieran is planning on planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official lists, he is the director of Edriftmoor Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's burgeoning restaurant trade.
"The sea is ours", Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean.
The Marines are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have been decorated with the blue flag of the ocean.
The motto of the naval stations stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: "The sea is ours by law".
It is our duty to restore it".
Bolivia's land still holds the memory of the waterway lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict over resources, as well as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades as Bolivia awaits a final ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a purpose, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a good ending", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Most Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling, which will be shown on the big screens of every country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is obligated to negotiate with Bolivia and give it free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president who is now fighting a controversial re-election battle next year, was also instrumental in Monday's decision.
"We're very close to getting back to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts say the court's decision will not be in favor of Bolivia, and it would make little difference if it were.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no control over Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
As the IMF's ruling comes six months after the final conflict was heard, it shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
And beyond the further progress of the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have put it off.
"The issue of Bolivia's access to the sea has been ignored by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric caused the last vestiges of goodwill on the part of Chile to disappear.
Eventually, Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate one day, but after that, the discussions will become very complicated.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
In The Hague, Bolivian representative and former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velce rejected the idea that the court had reached a decision in unusual speed.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of differences in mutual interests", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political platform.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to free access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization until the U.S. instills confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho says his people will never give up their nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Sunday.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises he made at the Singapore summit of rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of re-launching a nuclear arms embargo with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months after the Singapore summit.
According to Ri, it is "a dream of the century" that continues to impose sanctions, and the US's objection to the end of the Korean War will never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without the crucial step of disarming Pyongyang.
And Kim, and the U.S. President Donald Trump, they want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arms race, which the country probably sees as its only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
A new collection of hats has been unveiled at the Paris Fashion Show, and will soon be on display in your local rue d'Armes.
If you want to expand your collection of hats and get complete protection from the sun's rays, this is what you need.
Stylists Valentino and Tom Brownie showcased their new collection of SS19 large boots during Paris Fashion Week, and it took everyone by surprise.
A lot of ineffective hats have been trending on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the podium.
The highlight of Valentino's collection was the huge coral hat with a wide brimmed feathered edge wrapped around the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include a beaded pear, a witch's hat, and even a pear -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Broni also showed a selection of the most extraordinary masks, right up against Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipsticks that were more like Hannibal Lecter than the high-end cube.
One of the pieces resembled an underwater diving machine with its tube and its glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you follow the high fashion statement, you'll be successful.
Fashion watchers predict that giant caterpillars may soon be appearing on your main streets.
The larger-than-usual hats followed La Bomba, the two-foot-long frilly hat that was seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emile Ratajkowski.
The overly awkward hat-worshiping tag that was all over social media sent another big piece of art to the podium, a plump beach bag that was almost as big as a swimsuit model.
A dark orange raffia bag with raffia edges trimmed and covered with a white leather cuff, the most sought after from Jequ's La Rivière SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Hermitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags in the mainstream next summer, because the designer has made such a big impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are critical for global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools maintain records of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another astonishing string of test scores, only enhanced by individual and group successes in sports, the arts, music and other community work.
In Scotland, with over 30,000 pupils, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a pre-arranged curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a widespread and desired choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head".
If you speak to a person in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
And from the current results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league in terms of the highest passing percentage in independent schools.
68 percent of students who took foreign languages got an A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72% of students received a high A in Mandarin, while 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of Spanish learners also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are looking at foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly be required of children and young people in the future.
Now, in independent schools, languages are treated as electives in the same way as STEM subjects are treated.
In 2014, the UK Employment and Skills Commission identified the reasons employers have difficulty filling vacancies, with 17 per cent of these attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly crucial to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the prospect of more promising jobs requiring language skills, these skills have become important in a global world.
Regardless of their career choice, if they learn a second language, they have a real opportunity in the future to master a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate face-to-face with foreigners will mechanically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of 4,000 British adults, 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage, at 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is important for kids today.
Knowing several languages, especially in developing economies, will give children the opportunity to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be distinguished by the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK in 2020 onwards, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from, and the staff at those schools are experts in the field.
The aim of Scottish Independent Schools is to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
Now, in this global business environment, we cannot deny that languages remain essential to the future of the country, so this should be seen in education.
And so, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one minute, but less than 48", Welton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Tyrewdell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following the wakeup earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to get fit", he said.
Trump: West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign trail tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies Trump has planned for next week, including stops at friendly locations spanning Tennessee and Mississippi.
The confirmation vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing control of Congress, with the votes to be counted in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia today, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the YouTube feed below.
Trump is expected to speak about this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which have become a flashpoint for allegations of sexual misconduct, bringing with it a one-week delay in the Senate's confirmation hearings until the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this rallying is to help the Republicans, who are facing the November elections, to get momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said that the five rallies next week are aimed at bolstering volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season", said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named, according to Reuters.
Today's rally scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrsey, West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, who is on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to try to push him in the election", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup U.S. team was fighting confidently to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's game.
After three one-sided sessions on a Sunday afternoon, the quartet might just be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motor-powered slingshot is a completely invented sporting concept that players really believe in, and never more so than in competitions like this.
So, where do they think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead, which is now four, and I think we're keeping that as a little driving force", Jordan Speight said walking around that day.
Europe is clearly four points ahead and has 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spite says, feel that there is little air in their foreheads, though they have much to be inspired by, no less than the form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who have played against each other all day and each of them has added three points from four.
Spit was dead on the tee to green and he's leading by example.
The festive throat-screams became even more intense as his round continued, and he delivered the decisive blow to earn the right to participate in the four-way play when he and Thomas gave up two-by-two after a two-run home run.
His shot that won them by 15 was accompanied by a similar shriek, the kind that tells you he believes the American team is not out of the woods.
"You have to work harder and worry about your game", Spit said.
This is what each of these players left behind.
18 holes to make the mark.
The only players to score more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetfood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
Europe's weird, but attractive pair is 4 out of 4 and can't be wrong.
The only couple who didn't have a Saturday afternoon fling, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning golf.
That run and the way their energy seemed to flow into that wild crowd and back again, confirms that they are the players that should win on Friday, and there could be no more famous player than Fleetfood or Molinari, who would seal a potential European victory before the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both should be in different holes at the same time.
But the talk of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short piece about Sergio Garcia, the morning golf hero, when he was Alex Noren's partner.
A bogey and two two-handed throwers on the front nine pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of your hole.
It's so fascinating to watch the four balls and the fours up close, because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they've been given, the advice they haven't been given, and how the tactics can change in an instant.
Europe as a team has been playing better this time around and has made significant progress up to the final day, but the quarter-final session has shown that the US team has shown a level of enthusiasm that no one, especially Stateside, expected.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe led 10-6
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe will have a big advantage in Saturday's eight-ball and fours game, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the pair changed the score by two wins against the resistance Tiger Woods to bring their talisman up to the La Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to reclaim the trophy they lost in Hazelton two years ago, took the lead over the American side in the morning game, 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resilience during the game, but they failed to achieve victory.
Jim Furke's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to win the trophy back.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who earned the 'Mollywood' name after the weekend's glittering days, are only the second pair to win by four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history:
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in a four-ball game, they worked diligently to defeat Woods and American player Bryce DeCambeau, by a larger 5-4 score.
Woods, who had given himself a two-game lead on Saturday, had a great game, but he had already lost 19 of his 29 games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, resting from the morning game, returned to his teammate Henry Stenson in the quarterfinals and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world, by 2-1.
But Europe did not have the way it wanted to on that pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Shepard and Justin Thomas started the day ahead of the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They defeated Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter 2-1 in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarter, missing the opening two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history that a team has been held back by four points and gone into a single game, although the Fury side only need to score to keep the trophy.
After two days in a row as the second best, after Sunday's defeat, it seems that the horse is superior to them.
North Korea says it will never disarm completely without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are increasing mistrust of the US and the country will not give up its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Rhee told the annual General Assembly of the World's Nations that North Korea has taken "significant humanitarian measures" in the past year, such as a halt to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site, and a commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot have the security of our nation, and in no circumstances are we going to be the first to disarm.
While Ri echoed North Korea's familiar grievances directed at Washington's phased approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded before it took gradual steps, his statement was important because it did not deny unilateral denuclearization without oversight, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the shocking joint statement made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump at their first joint summit in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always wanted to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang should first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease tough international sanctions on South Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization is a priority and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and even objects to the declaration of an end to the war", Rin said.
The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is simply the dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continual penalties only deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not say anything about Kim's plans for a second summit with Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea had been on the side of this denuclearization issue, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.
Even if that were the case, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year's tone when he told the UN General Assembly that the U.S. mainland was becoming a North Korean missile target after Mr. Trump called Kim a missile man on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy the world with North Korea, praised Kim for his bold steps to disarm, but said there was still work to be done, and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, noting that it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia are insisting that the UN Security Council compensate Pyongyang for its actions.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that the Security Council must continue to apply sanctions actively and without fail until the complete, final, affirmative abandonment of nuclear weapons.
In 2006, the Security Council began imposing sanctions on North Korea to disrupt Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ra on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and announced that he would be traveling again next month to prepare for the second Pyongyang Summit.
Pompeo has already made three visits to Pyongyang this year, but the last one didn't go so well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made and that North Korea had been able to accuse him of making "terrorist demands" in a matter of hours.
At this month's meeting, North Korea promised to dismantle its missile site and nuclear facility if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He told Kim that "the measures in question" are Trump's promised safeguards in Singapore and are aimed at improving relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University are taking a special class on how to get enough rest.
The new course allowed his graduate students to sleep more to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night long on caffeine.
The academic found that students at the world's top universities often lack basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
This course was developed by Charles Keisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who claims it is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was excited to start her course on the effects of insomnia on education.
Finally, a girl came up to him and said, "Why am I only now in senior year finding out about this?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which was a big surprise to her", she told the Telegraph.
The first class this year is explaining to students how good sleep habits can affect academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barrea, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to suspend classes as soon as it became clear that students had indeed not slept that week.
The one-hour course includes a variety of interactive tasks.
One part of it shows a hall where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how poor sleep can affect athletic performance, and the importance of sleep.
In another section, participants are shown how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map encourages participants to think about everyday life.
We know that this can't change student behavior overnight.
"But we believe they have a right to know about it, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of tobacco use", Professor Kaisler added.
She said that the proud culture of "stay-at-night" still exists, adding that modern technology and its ever-increasing pressure on students means that insomnia is a growing problem.
Quality and adequate sleep should be the secret weapon of students to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, even prevent weight gain, because sleeplessness turns on the brain's hunger mode, and they're always hungry.
Raymond, a 19-year-old California student in the department of chemistry and physical biology, is helping Professor Keisler organize the course, having delivered one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to run courses all over the university.
She then expects to ask applicants to participate in this educational program before entering the institution's competition.
Professor Hessler recommends that students create a memory-based schedule of when to go to sleep and when to wake up, and that they learn about the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which interfere with the sleep process.
Livingston Rangers 1-0 Menga defeated the Gerards
The Rangers were struck once again as Dolly Mengani's strike defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
After a 4-1 defeat in Johnstone in February, Imbrocks wanted to record his first win, but Garry Holtz's team disappointed Gerrard for a second time by losing the eighteenth game to a 8 point margin at Ledbrok in the Premier League.
Menga came out seven minutes before halftime, and it looked like the Rangers were never going to be ready to play.
With Rangers sixth, Livingston is in third with a few goals to Hibernia.
The Rangers had another problem later, as linebacker Calum Spence suffered a head injury from an object being thrown at him.
Gerrard's eight-point margin also resulted in a half-hit by replacing Erin with Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, joined Livingston in scoring last week and was impressed with how well he prepared.
The Rangers may have been the dominant force, but Livingston was the one who had the most leverage.
They used two minutes when Megan was sent off for the first time, which allowed Scott Pitman to attack Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder stopped the ball.
Kagan Jacobs' shot reached Craig Halkett, but midfielder Alan Lithgow could only bounce the ball back.
The Rangers took the game into their own hands, but in the third quarter, they had more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morales was due to be sent off for a collision with Steven Loles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombians' demands.
Rangers managed to score two tries in the first half, but former Inbox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unnerved by the strikes of Lasana Kollibey and Ovi Idzharia.
Livingston's opening in the 34th minute was against the rules of the game, but no one could deny that it was a deserved shot.
The Rangers were again unable to resist Jacobs's attack.
Scott Arfield did not react to Declan Callagher giving the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed it to Megan to finish.
Gerrard replaced Calibal with René Kent at halftime, after which the striker attacked Morelos, but Kylie stopped the ball immediately.
Livingston continued to delight the crowd with his play as Lithgow and Halkit kept the ball in their hands.
Holt's teammates could have run the game in their favor in some rounds, but McGregor was able to push Jacobs back before Lithgow struck from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was again given the right to a penalty for a collision with Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored.
The inventor of the Almanac Giger
And now, a passage from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... On this day, the physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Giger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the Giger counter.
The once-great science calculator Giger has also become a pop culture staple, as in The Bells of Coronado, starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What is it?
Roger: This is a Giger counter that helps detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these in, you hear the presence of atoms caused by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: Tell me, this really works now.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot foreign cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells.
The idea is to take immune cells from the patient and change them in a lab-grade cell.
They find proteins that are specific to many types of cancer and then they put them back in.
The vaccine has shown promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who was injected with a rogue cell-recognition vaccine discovered that her ovarian cancer had disappeared after more than 18 months.
The idea is to take immune cells from the patient and modify them in the lab to find proteins that are involved in many types of cancer called HER2, and then inject those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the vaccine is promising".
The HER2 gene causes several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel, explains Professor Berezovsky.
The approach of taking immune cells from a patient and training them to detect cancer cells has also helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing the "Make America Great Again" hat, has opened the debate against Trump on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was embarrassed on SNL when he started praising the United States. President Donald Trump and he announced that he would be inaugurated in 2020.
With the title Make America Great Again, he sang the third song of the night, called "City of the Wolves". He then went on to criticize the Democrats and endorse Trump.
When I talk to white people, they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist".
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began its show with a Matt Deynon imitation, where the Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christina Blaze Ford's sexual assault.
Although it was not aired, West's video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock did it to get to West or not.
In addition, West complained to the audience that the hat was making it difficult for him to perform.
They slandered me.
They said not to go out in that hat.
They did it to my head.
According to the Washington Examiner, I'm in heaven.
He went on, "You want to see heaven?" As if he wanted to wear his superman bra, as if that meant no one could tell him what to do. "You want to take the world forward".
"Try to love".
His comments repeatedly angered the audience. SNL members also seemed concerned. Variety reported that one person even said, "The whole studio went down".
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing "I Love" as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by conservative party leader Candace Thorner, who wrote: "To one of the brave souls. Thank you for your support in front of the crowd".
Host Karen Hunter wrote that West was just what she was, and that's absolutely wonderful.
"But I don't want to praise someone by buying their music, clothes or supporting their art when their ideology is dangerous to my community".
"He is free".
"We are too", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He follows Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Puffy and P Diddy.
And Snoop Dogg was renamed Snoop Dogg Lane, and indeed the music legend Prince changed his name to symbolize the Prince.
There was a stabbing attempt in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of stabbing a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihakamor.
On Monday, the defendant will appear in the Belfast District Court.
The charge will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star of Game of Thrones, Harrington, is portrayed as a poisonous maniac.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow's sword-wielding character in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such roles make boys think that they have to be rude to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and asked how to tackle toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, 31, again, has confirmed that he is very determined to solve the problem.
"I wonder a lot myself about where we went wrong with masculinity", he said.
The way we've taught men, they've grown up, and now we're seeing the problem.
Keith believes that television should be partly responsible for teaching masculinity through its very masculine characters.
He went on: "What is natural and what is acquired".
What they learn from TV and the streets that makes young boys become that type of man.
I think this is one of the most pressing issues of our time: how do we change that?
Because it definitely has a bad effect on young boys.
In an interview, he admitted that when all the Game of Thrones episodes are finished next summer, he will not be playing in any more seasons because he is tired of the battlefield and horses.
In November, Keith will play Sam Shepard in The West Wing, a film about a film director and his brother.
The actor recently confirmed that the first good thing about Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Leslie.
"I met my wife on this film, and that was the beginning of my future family, and then my life", he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy television series, Rose is the love interest of Igrid, played by Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's father's house in Scotland.
China reports a 14 percent increase in HIV/AIDS cases.
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were 40,000 cases.
Unlike in the past, most cases were transmitted sexually.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread rapidly through contaminated blood in parts of China.
At a conference in Yunnan, Chinese health officials reported that HIV transmission via this route had even been eliminated.
But every year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of AIDS has become a major issue in China's LGBT community.
1997 Homosexuality is outlawed in China, but discrimination against the LGBT community is considered unjust.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is said that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with men will marry women.
The primary cause of disease transmission is unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment accessible to address the problem.
Maxim Volter denies that the data of the senators of the Grand Old Party has been leaked, claims that they are dangerous lies and conspiracy.
In the United States, Maxim Voltaire on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of his staff had posted the personal details of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that the protests were from right-wing pundits and web hackers.
"Lies, lies and more insulting lies", the tweet said.
The leaked information included home addresses and cell phone numbers belonging to United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online by an anonymous person on Thursday during the Supreme Court hearings on the sexual abuse of Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill.
The leak happened after the three senators had examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the messages matched Waters' office address, and that the address was the source of the leak of Waters' staff information.
Waters went on to say that these baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false.
A member of my staff whose identity, privacy and security were compromised as a result of these false and false accusations is in no way responsible for the leak.
These baseless accusations are completely wrong and utter lies.
Waters' announcement was immediately criticized across the internet. One of the critics was former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This is a lie of rage", wrote the Flash.
This means that he has no desire to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not object.
He should not question the motives of the one making the accusation.
He needs to stay calm and quiet.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during Tuesday's hearings.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro tried to oust Waters in the midterm elections and shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Good if it's true", he wrote with a smile.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted law enforcement and other authorities to the allegations.
"We will be determined to bring the culprits to justice", he continued, "and to hold them fully accountable for their actions, which have a devastating and destructive impact on any member of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to seek out the Brexit meaning in a new British-language film. This seems acceptable in the case of the Johnny English action-comedy revival, which began as early as 2003 and was revived in 2011 with the Johnny English revival.
It would be ridiculously self-righteous to think what a waste we are for having the opportunity to be a national export.
Anyway, with his unintelligible figure, his small eyes, his unpleasant face, Johnny English has been licensed for a second time, which means he's a comic face for non-English speaking societies.
He's obviously a dumb secret agent who, despite his oddities, has a little bit of a Mr. Bean Clouseau, thanks to his contribution to the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony's flaming chariot song.
He is also originally based on the character of the mythical traveller and international man Atticus, who played a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, creating a chaotic situation behind his back.
There's a nice moment or two in the last Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English approaching the helicopter in a medieval military uniform and a helmet with helicopter wings spinning around it.
Atkinson's physical comedic gift is shown, but the humor has lost its power and is considered redundant, as it is already an integral part of serious films such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
Humor is more appealing to children than to adults, and to me, Johnny English is not as artistic and fixed as Atkinson's character of Bean.
Now Britain is in serious danger.
Cyber hackers have broken into the online data of British spies, revealing the identities of the undercover agents, replacing the agent with a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the confused and persecuted Prime Minister, who suffers from a sense of political ambiguity. Emma Thompson does the impossible as Theresa May, but there is nothing to do in the script either.
The advisers say that since all the spies have been exposed, we should bring one of the retired ones back.
This means going back to Johnny English, who now teaches at a number of institutions, but also teaches how to be a covert agent. A little undercover humor: he proposes to establish a school for espionage.
The Englishman returned to Whitehall for a quick chat and was reunited with his former partner, Buffy, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and a submarine commander, in the role of happy hockey players, where Vicky Pepperdine has weakened a bit.
So Batman and Robin make a big mistake and return to the Secret Service, where they meet the beautiful wife of Olga Kurlenko, Ofelia Bulyatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen for a trick of billionaire technicians who believe they can solve Britain's computer problems, Jack Lacy, who played the villain Jason Volta.
English and Buffy begin their comedy series: as waiters, they burn down the French restaurant, cause a riot on Volta's boat. English organizes an anarchy using virtual reality headsets to see what is going on in Volta's house.
Eventually, all the activities came to light, but because they were fun and interesting, there's a whole children's TV channel about them.
It's a little too much.
And with all the other English films, I always wonder if it's possible for the British film industry to give Roman Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent.
Labour claims to be developing a plan whereby British people will work four days, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is proposing a plan whereby British people will work four days, but get paid for five days.
The party wants companies to give their employees an extra day off thanks to the availability of artificial intelligence.
It would be nice if workers had three days off, but they would be paid for the rest of the day.
Sources say the idea has entered the economic agenda and is meant to transform the country for the benefit of workers.
The idea of a four-day work week was endorsed by the World Trade Congress as a good way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A Labour spokesman told the Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, the proposal will be delivered.
This is not a one-day problem, but the idea of a four-day work week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy, as well as the party's industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to embrace such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea has not yet been fully taken up by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.
John McDonnell had organized a conference for Labour to present his vision of bringing about a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to review the distribution of power in the utilities between the CEO and the trustees.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also envisages that water company shareholders will not receive their full share as the Labour Party can make cuts in light of a number of shortcomings.
He also confirmed that they plan to withhold 10% of the companies and pass it on to employees who refuse to pay up to 500 euros in utility fees.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told 60 Minutes that the FBI would change its mind about Kavanaugh.
The FBI's investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week. The question arises whether the FBI's findings could force Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a reporter for 60 Minutes magazine asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more relaxed than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
I said I would attend the auditions, I said I had spoken to Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were brought and said, "You did it".
He was determined, without hesitation.
Gram is still as quiet as a fish.
"I have my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and that's a baseless accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett is in denial", Graham added, referring to Christina Leslie Ford.
And all the people he's referring to can't confirm that.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Initiative and will it reduce poverty?
This week, New York City will host the Global Citizen Event, an annual music event that features great, great bands with a great mission to reduce poverty.
This is the seventh year that tens of thousands of people have gathered at the Botanical Garden not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Kardie Bee and Shawna Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's core goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen's Initiative is a continuation of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group that aims to increase the number of people actively fighting to end poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event, unless you want VIP tickets, you have to do a few things like volunteering, sending emails to the governing bodies, making phone calls and a number of other activities aimed at eradicating poverty.
Global Citizen has achieved its goal.
Is it a good idea to hire people with free admission, or are they just comfortable with the idea that they can make a difference just by sending an email?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011, 19 million actions have been taken by its supporters for various purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to mobilize world leaders and raise over 37 billion dollars, which could change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group received 390 calls and applications, which have raised about $10 billion.
The group reports that the funds could be directed to some 659 million people worldwide.
The calls were largely from the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment firm whose vision is to develop children's full potential. After receiving 4,700 entries from Global Citizen, it pledged $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition.
"We can make history by fighting against the social injustice of undernutrition with the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, including you", said the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, Tracy Ullman, at her live concert in London in 2018.
The group also reported that as a result of more than 5,000 actions taken to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government decided to fund the Power of Nutrition programme, which will help to ensure that 5 million women and children are fed.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the Web is, "What makes you believe that we can end poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's a long and difficult road, there will be setbacks and failures.
Like the civil rights and anti-war movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Vicente, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are among the stars who came to New York City to attend the event, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Interior: "The United States can use the Navy to disrupt Russian energy exports".
"Washington can use its navy to block Russian energy supplies, including from the Middle East, if it so chooses", U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zeman added that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is a legitimate invitation from the government, is a prerequisite for finding new markets.
"I believe they will sell their energy in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do it.
"The United States, with the help of our navy, has the ability to make sure that the sea ports are open and, if necessary, can block them to make sure that their energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the event, hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organization that bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less to substitute and maximize fuel", he said, portraying Russia as a "one-track pony" with a fossil fuel economy.
According to the statements, the Trump administration was fulfilling its mission to increase LNG exports to Europe by replacing Russia, offering European consumers a cheaper option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, have been trying to convince Germany to abandon the ill-conceived Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a pawn in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, built to double the existing capacity of the pipeline by up to 110 square meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition to Washington's project is merely economically justified and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we are in agreement that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was met with a counterattack by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (GFA), has urged the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply", said Daetter Kamp, president of the German Industrial Federation (GIF), after the last meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will pay close attention to running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be taking a hard look at running for president after the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the head of the woman", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6, I will be very careful about running for president.
In a public meeting, Warren expressed his opinion of President Donald Trump, saying that he is taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavin.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll on Thursday, however, showed that most of Varen's own constituents think he should not run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts prospective voters said the senator should not be nominated.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of the nomination.
The poll showed former governor Deval Patrick had more supporters, with 38 percent in favor of his possible nomination and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names touched on the 2020 list of possible candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaking at a rally for Donald Trump about Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and fined for domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he comes back, I can speak to other families who are feeling the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds that our soldiers come back with", he told an audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a Donald Trump rally.
Palin called his arrest "a room full of elephants", and said of his friend and other war veterans, "They come back a little bit different, they come back tense, they come back wondering if they'll find respect for what their fellow sailors and pilots and other members of the military have given this country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and fined for domestic violence against a woman, according to a report of domestic violence and use of a weapon while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Banetti, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington support the new asylum policy challenge.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia briefly appeared in Washington on Friday as court counsel to support the anti-refugee policy, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace V. Augustin, and the suit against the American Civil Liberties Union's federal policy is not being disclosed.
He said his partner and his powerful gang of thugs had insulted him, but U.S. officials had denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace presented El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have a persistent problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was in direct conflict with a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who suffered domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rasi said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, national and international law".
"State law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claims, and such a prohibition does not uphold that principle", the court counselor said briefly.
The lawyers then briefly discussed the fact that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are potential entrepreneurs and "necessary labour suppliers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop sheltering victims of gang and domestic violence in June.
"A refugee is someone who leaves their home because of persecution or fear of persecution related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
The shelter was never meant to solve all the problems, even the most serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palau as the death toll on the road to finding the fighters has doubled.
For the fighters, the situation was quite horrifying.
"It was very difficult", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was caring for her young son with a high fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, the E.R. is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
They saw residents returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their belongings from wet sites, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who had suffered bruises to his back and shoulders, were lying in Palus Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he described how he felt when a strong earthquake shook the five-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
"I was squeezed under the rubble, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of terrorizing the country with propaganda.
A week after the Chinese official newspaper in the US published a four-page ad, praising the benefits of US-China trade every day, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda through the US media.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referenced a paid app of the Des Moines Register, the largest selling daily newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election showed what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of a worsening trade war, which has seen them level the playing field when it comes to imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
The anti-dumping tariffs imposed by China in the earlier phase of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, say American and Chinese experts.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branshead, who was the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had targeted American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Bransstead wrote in a column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, by placing propaganda ads in its own free press, China is now doubling down on this persecution.
"By placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's tradition of freedom of speech and the press", Brentsted wrote.
"On the contrary, given that the press is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, here in the Beijing street newspaper press, one can find a limited number of opposing views and no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrisome economic path", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers" had avoided his suggestion to publish the article, though he did not specify which paper it was.
Republicans in the Cavan area are pushing women voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn
While many senior Republicans have remained steadfast in their support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face opposition in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment was very strong, and most Republicans have officially said they want to continue voting.
"These things are irreversible", said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Riheuer said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flecks of Arizona's last-minute assertion of the need for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", according to the Washington Post, as Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn progressive group, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, when the Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be enormous", nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rottenberg told the news site.
People say it's already high, and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among the unbiased voters in the suburbs, as well as young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, while disliking the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony about allegations of sexual harassment against the nominee for Supreme Court member, analysts speculated that if Republicans decide to confirm his nomination, there could be a backlash.
"This is a mess for the Republican Party", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be on the court, but it's about how Republicans have approached the issue and how they've treated him", Guy Cecil, who heads the Priorities USA group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, Americans seem to be a little bit split on who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents probably or confidently believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent probably or confidently believe Cavanaugh's.
Furthermore, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, and 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's claim, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh was assaulted when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a nominee for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals while attending a party while a student at Yale University in 1980.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new network to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Hardware, is launching a startup that will aim to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
It uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online data store.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all accessible in the same browser and at the same time.
The beauty of a personal online repository is that the user is the one who decides who can access the information.
The company calls it "enhancing personal rights and opportunities through data".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform offered by IBM, a few of the hardware programmers who were hired to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether to invest in a complete overhaul in places where their business models are completely changed in a second.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide a commercial powerhouse and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the Global SearTech Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Raised a clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was raised in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant General, Father Bernard Van was awarded this medal on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Belangis and Léocourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the memorial would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's deed deserving of the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant General Bernard Van led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in the dense darkness and under the fire of field guns and machine guns".
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest civility pushed the line forward, then single-handedly quickly picked up the field gun and slaughtered the three members of the squad.
The lieutenant general was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I knew I would never deserve, but that deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor to be part of the parade and added that the dignity of a hero of the Iranian people is manifested in the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 but instead saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 in a packed auditorium just to be denied access to the main event.
There were 13 fights scheduled in San Jose, including 6 majors that were to be shown live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Moses and Rory McDonald were about to fight, television viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when they began showing Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed because they had stayed up until the morning for a special duel.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to a children's cartoon as a "dirty joke".
"It's a government regulation that at 6 o'clock, content like this is not appropriate, so they had to switch from kids' shows", said Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications Dave Schwartz, in response to a question about the switch.
"Yes, Piglet to Peppa". "I'm going to the piglet".
Scott Cocker, the president of Bellator, said they're going to work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think we can do it", said Cocker.
But it's six o'clock there on a Sunday morning, and we can't do it until six o'clock on Sunday, which is Monday on their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission changed there, there were many messages, none of them very pleasant.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a state-level issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give the fans more, but we failed.
This is a surprising situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says it wasn't until he was in high school that he realized that not everyone is like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, which was first hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that after becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirstie Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
In Laverne's first broadcast, Dale said that growing up he felt inferior to others because it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls.
She said, "Today, this feeling of being inferior and different actually gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove that he was something, so that people wouldn't be confused by his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he had the fortune to live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire hope in others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with an American film director, Dustin Lance Black, in 2013 was a surprise for her.
Last year, Daly married an Oscar-winning filmmaker who is 20 years older than she is, but she says the age gap has never been an issue.
He said that when you go through so much at such a young age (he was at his first Olympics at 14 and his father died three years later of cancer), it was hard to find a peer who had gone through the same things.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Dale says the whole picture has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said that the whole point is to win the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer.
Dale said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if they won the London 2012 Games, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be there to sit in the front row,'" she said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and only when she stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that she was not invulnerable", he said.
The next year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life, to dive in front of an Olympic audience at home, and it couldn't have been better", he said.
It also influenced her choice of first song, which was Heather Small's "Proud", which she had been singing throughout her Olympic preparation, and which she still sings to this day.

Mickelson, in poor form, is on the sideline for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Saturday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to work on his fitness if he doesn't want it to be an unfortunate incident.
He's playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, but coach Jim Furyk has left him on the bench for Sunday's games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so often happens, the five-time champion spent half his day as a fan and the other half working on his game on the field, trying to fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old, who was not even one of the best first-strikers at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where irregularities usually punish the wrong striker.
And even if the field itself isn't so scary, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with young Tom Fitwood to win all the matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points ahead of the 12th-place team, get off to a good start, Mickelson's play could be decisive.
Fury had a message for his boys, not that he had anything else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, he put his hand on my shoulder, he hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyck.
He has great confidence in his powers.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's given so much to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more in mind, but this is what happened, and this is, I think, the path that we should have taken.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really matched his personal bests.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyck says his presence adds something unbelievable to the team.
"He's funny, he's witty and smart, he likes to play pranks on people, and he's a great teammate", she explained.
I think the young players had fun playing against him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than the game.
Europe's oldest, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great advantage may soon be lost.
European veteran Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant lead before the Ryder Cup finals can easily turn into an uncomfortable process.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where the Black Ballesters led by 5 points over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with a small margin of 141⁄2-13 1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Valderrama, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but by a small margin", Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 overall yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you're going to be at your best.
Go out and do it right.
Nothing is finished as long as you have a scoreboard.
We have a goal to try and win this prize, and that's what we're focused on.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also realize who's on the other side, the best players in the world.
After seeing how his players performed on the hard course, Byrne said: "I could never have done better.
Tomorrow is all history.
Tomorrow is the individual talks, and that's something else.
It's nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, you're going through a full experience as a golfer.
That's the message you need to give the players, to make the most of tomorrow.
Now, let your teammate do his best tomorrow.
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored 3 out of 4.
Furyik himself has been on both sides of these last day twists, from being part of the winning team in Brooklyn to being on the losing side when Europe was left out of the miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 senior, had assembled his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get ahead of the game, like we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When that drive somehow starts to work, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We're choosing our lineup and we're giving the guys that we're going to try to do the magic tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked to try to lead the fight, he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, the other Europeans in the first half are Paul Keys, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter.
"I picked the guys in this order because I think it's the right order from start to finish", Bjorn said of his picks.
The launch of Germany's new battleship has been delayed again
The German Navy's new frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleships, but at least until the end of the year it won't happen due to broken systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman was quoted as saying by the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but concerns over the delivery of the ship have prevented the ambitious project from being completed.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, which were ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with powerful artillery, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some secret technology such as reduced radio, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service lives: it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from local ports for up to two years.
But the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to expand its influence abroad, will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigates made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to a shipping company after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German press noted a number of key design and technical defects that would render the battleship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The programming flaws were especially significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be manned by a crew of 120 sailors, half the number of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was considerably heavy, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to make further improvements.
It is said that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
Apart from the equipment, the entire cost of the project, including the training of the staff, also becomes an issue.
It is said to have gone from an initial €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems with the new frigates become even more important in light of the recent warnings of a weakening German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "cutting down" the ships that could be deployed.
The official said the problem has grown over time as old ships are decommissioned but not replaced with new ones.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could accommodate the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of the bats
A new study conducted in a remote area of the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape to forage for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and contribute to their future conservation.
The research, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and capricious butterflies as well as the brown-bellied long-eared bat and the Dobbenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed around the main campsite to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held sensors.
Experimental analysis of all the recordings will track the frequency of the bats' vocal signals, and determine which species are doing what.
And then we'll map the natural environment and report back to create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Duar, an environmental consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to clarify the benefits of environmental management activities such as the creation of wetlands, and will help to find out how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are endangered because of construction and development work that affects the natural habitats of the bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a threat, as can fly-sticky paper and chemical treatment of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Girls aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated voice recognition techniques to find the insects and stop them in their tracks.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 highly trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect residential areas, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary in Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to 8 of Scotland's 10 bat species.
The castle's manager, David Thompson, says the castle is an ideal location for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a huge space for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, all of which are good places to live.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other habitats is going to help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of checking for bats and of doing new conservation work inside the settlement, as the accidental destruction of a single colony can kill up to 400 eggs and young bats, thus potentially wiping out the entire population.
Girls are protected, and it's illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell of the Butterfly Conservation Foundation in Scotland urged the public to come together to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many species live".
Ronaldinho denies the rape allegations, and lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people want to use his name to promote themselves.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Katherine Majorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It was confirmed that he then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video, calling the claims "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be known for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is very good. " The player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they call "unacceptable personal statements".
Attorney Kristian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "psychological harm to the extent of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious cases of violation of personal rights in recent years".
They say the alleged incident took place in June of 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorgan went back to the casino room where he allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, fell at his feet and told him that he was a "99 percent" "good guy" who had done wrong because of "one percent"
The documents show that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sexual relations, but it was by mutual consent.
Maerga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her wounds taken at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the matter out of court because she was "afraid of reprisal" and did not want to "be embarrassed in public".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she is still bearing the consequences of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged accusations, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juventus for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England will forever regret losing the car manufacturers.
Britain will forever regret losing its reputation as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota (UK) told the BBC that if Anguilla leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Brathnaghn plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that border delays due to a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Brasstain plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, chief executive of the Branson Toyota.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about how their cross-border business would fare in the event of a no-deal Brexit, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, they're going to close their Mini plant in Oxford within a month.
According to car companies, their main concern is supply chain risks in a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing is based on the "just in time" principle, whereby parts for custom cars are sourced from suppliers in England and the European Union every 37 minutes.
If England leaves the European Union on March 29 without a deal, there will be disruption at the border, which manufacturers say could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "will be clearly aimed at avoiding border checks".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not just to have the success that we have now, but to take advantage of that opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
"The facts, not just Toyota, but other automakers, show that we absolutely need to continue to have highly efficient supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cut jobs.
Peter Tsvaleris, who has worked at Branstein for 24 years and is in charge of the Massy Union in the factory, said that its members are extremely worried: "In my experience, if these jobs go, they don't come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a clear and robust plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump-Rosenstein summit may be delayed again, says White House
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed by another week as the battle against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein follows the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible miscarriages of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would remove the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a source of heated debate in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the statement.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, under the guise of announcing his resignation.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would prefer not to expel Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Judicial Council, which was investigating the testimony of Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders has spoken on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "The date has not been set, it could be this week, I think it will be postponed for another week, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court".
But, as we'll see, I always like to keep the press updated.
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
And our host, Chris Vallance, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "demonstrative" behavior of television journalists, however, he said, "I'm not denying the fact that it's demonstrative behavior".
Then he said that direct communication between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is attending more Q&A meetings than any president before him", he said, without citing any evidence.
The hearings will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States direct questions, that's better than talking to me.
We've tried to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've done that over the past few weeks, and it's going to happen again at a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why he has a ready and sometimes strange attitude in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Minister for Health writes to NHS Scotland's EU staff about Brexit concerns.
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to the EU staff at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and its desire to remain in the EU in the wake of Brexit.
MSP Jane Freeman has written to say that she will leave within six months of Britain leaving the European Union.
The Scottish government is already prepared to accept the cost of applying for EU citizenship for those who have taken up employment in the public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the winter, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, leading to decisions expected this autumn.
But the British government has also advanced its preparations for a possible version of the deal.
I know this is going to be a very unfortunate time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you again and again how much I value the contribution of every single member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Partners in the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christian Abercombe is having emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercombe underwent emergency surgery for a head injury after Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly after the semifinals.
"He crossed the line and he hit it right there", said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercombe at the sideline before moving him to a blanket and sending him for further examination.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercombe is being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that details on the type/grade of the injury are still being sought and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercombe, who was a two-year starter at second base, is in his first season with Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five power tricks before he retired on Saturday, which added to his 18 power tricks this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the stamp when they buy property in England.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the stamp when they buy property in England, with the extra money that the new Tory plan says is meant to help the homeless.
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp duty increase will be for those who don't pay taxes in England.
The Treasury is planning to increase the amount of aid to help the homeless by up to £120 million a year.
Foreign buyers buying property in England will pay more for the stamps than the extra money that is earmarked to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counterbalance Corbyn's desire to win over young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will remain for individuals and organisations who do not pay tax in England, providing extra money for the government to tackle the homeless problem.
The premium, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the high-end second home and rental purchases introduced two years ago, could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury estimates that this will bring in £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-British nationals, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many of the richest parts of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the city.
A new policy will be introduced a week after Boris Johnson approved the reduction in stamp duty, allowing more young people to buy their first home.
He blamed big construction companies for seizing land but not using it to keep house prices high and convinced Mrs May to make rents affordable to solve England's shameful housing problem.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including mortgage controls and the end of foreclosure.
He also wants to give local governments greater powers to build new houses.
Miss May said: "Last year I said that I would use my work to help restore the British dream that life would be better for any new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-resident and overseas based organisations in England to buy a home as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For quite a few people, the dream of owning a home is becoming more unattainable, and the stigma of homelessness is becoming more real.
Jack Ross: My main objective is to govern Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's governor at some stage.
Scott, 42, is enjoying a challenge to rebuild at the North-East club, who are now in third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer, following his call-up to the Scottish Premiership side St Mirren last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up seeing Scotland as a child with my father in Hampden, Scotland, and that was something that always held me back.
That opportunity would only come if I was a successful club leader.
As manager of Sunderland, Ross's predecessors have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Alordis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane and Paulo Di Canio, who were also the managers of the club.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has no qualms about following such stable people at such a big club, who have previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success for me at this point is going to be measured by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and capabilities of this club, it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League.
"It's not an easy task to achieve, but I'll probably see my success only if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his managerial career, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-place relegation, and reclaimed St Mirren from relegation to the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says that he now feels better than he ever did in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real dilemma", he said of taking over Alloa.
I honestly believe that management was more for me than acting.
It sounds strange, because I was playing well, and making a good living from it, and also enjoying some important highs.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through during the week.
I'm still going through all of this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management is more soul-based.
I've always wanted to manage and now that I do, I feel much more comfortable than I have in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview with Sportsound on Saturday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland, at 12:00-13:00 BST.
According to research, the best time to drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat is providing a revenue stream for struggling bars in England, but it's also putting more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to the figures, the bar groups have a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but the restaurant revenue has decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from business consultancy CGA, which released the data, said: "Continued hot weather and England's longer than expected World Cup participation have made July also follow the pattern of the previous month of June, when bar revenue rose 2.8 percent, except for restaurants, which were more affected".
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurants in June was worse than in July.
Drinking has made bars and pubs work better than it has made restaurants work less.
Food also reduced the number of pubs in the summer, but not as badly as restaurants.
It looks like people are just coming out to drink.
Pubs and bars' drink sales rose 6.6 percent in a month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman of RSM Entertainment and Hospitality Analytics said, "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to out-of-home sales.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-over-year decline in sales volume will especially impact current peak spending.
The long hot summer couldn't be worse for food producers, and time will tell if the lighter temperatures in August will provide any measure of the expected relief.
The overall increase in pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, affecting the reduction in brand investments.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring of the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in England collected and analysed the performance of 47 operating groups that had a combined £9 income, and is a defining indicator of the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
According to the study, one in five 11-year-olds has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram accounts.
This news has reinforced fears that sexual information is spreading
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account to show their parents.
One in five 11-year-olds create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts, which were linked to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has increased the fear that sexual information is being spread.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "basic" account to show their parents, but they also had personal accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website exposed a young man who was convincing others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Private Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, half of whom admit to having a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many young people are being tempted to create an online platform where parents and teachers cannot find themselves".
Ellie Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eli Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body, the Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Biddie said the move was a good opportunity for sporting administrators to benefit from his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Ella is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, England and around the world, and we are confident that recommending her will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland", Biddini said.
Doyle said, "I'll be very happy to be the voice of the athletes, and hopefully I'll really have a voice and help to govern the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and has four Olympic medals in total, and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "On this day a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a grueling job, but I'm fully recovered, I've learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing aerobic exercise.
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows is circulating online.
A breast pump company has taken to the internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that give milk.
To promote what is being called "the world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a lighthearted music video, a commercial that shows the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dancing in a grass-covered cow barn to a song that has words like, "Yes, I'm crawling, but you don't see any tails", and if you haven't noticed, these are not my boobs, but my boobs.
The chorus goes on: "Push them out, push them out, I feel it, baby, push them out, push them out, I'm going to get my wings!"
However, the ad placed on the company's Facebook page has been the subject of controversy on the online platform.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it mocks the dairy industry's "monsters".
It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
They have to get pregnant and give birth just like us to have milk, except that their babies aren't stolen from them a few days after they give birth", wrote one person.
Elvie's breast pump is seamlessly inserted into the feeding chest (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for the mother and the child".
But, yes, why not use them to promote breast pumps to mothers who buy them to keep their babies?
Another added: "What a non-realistic advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "too funny".
I think that's a great idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was for.
"This is a great product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad targeting moms who are coughing (often at their work or in the bathroom) and feel like a wuss".
This is not an ad that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with pumps hidden in their nipples.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women who lick their breasts feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and is discreetly fitted into the feeding chest, allowing the woman to move freely, hold the baby, and even leave the house during the feedings.
Ana Balarin, ECD and partner of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a lively and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenge of breastfeeding and all its challenges, and to show in a fun and relatable way the indescribable sense of freedom that pumps bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, two moms appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children on the Texas border slowly made their way to a tent camp.
Although monthly border crossings have remained relatively stable, the number of detected immigrant children has increased rapidly, in part because of the Trump administration's tough policies that have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Typically, many of the sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid to jeopardize their chances of staying in the country by demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when government agencies announced that prospective guardians and adult members of the household would have to submit their fingerprints, and that the data would be passed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had turned up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous convictions.
About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are criminal aliens.
So we're still looking for these individuals", Mr. Albans said.
To expedite the investigation of children, officials introduced a new law that could require them to appear in court within a month of being discovered, instead of the 60 days that the court said was the previous standard for workers.
Many will be appearing via video conference calls, instead of going in person, to petition the immigration court to legalize their case.
Those who fail to meet the requirements will be subject to expedited deportation.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer these children are in custody, the more likely they are to become delusional or to experience depression, which can lead to tantrums and escape attempts.
Lawyers say this concern is even greater in large areas like the Tornillo, where the greater the area, the more easily the children's suffering is noticed.
They added that moving children to a shelter city without mentally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye to their friends could leave them with a trauma that many already suffer from.
Syria is telling the US, France and Turkey to withdraw the "occupying forces".
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister of International Relations Walid al-Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for eight years.
Mouallem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and should be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that the "war on terror" is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011.
He said that Damascus would continue this holy struggle until all the territories of Syria were cleaned from both terrorist groups and the presence of "non-Jewish foreigners".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training or advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the country at war.
Speaking about refugees, Mouallem said that the conditions for their return are good and accused certain Western countries of spreading "unreasonable fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement to end the war between Assad and his opposition forces.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to push political negotiations forward.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to 3 million people.
However, Mouallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "destroyed".
UN Ambassador Stéphane de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition representatives soon to draft a constitution for post-war Syria, paving the way for elections.
Mouallem presented the Syrian government's conditions for participating in the committee's work, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution" and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will be reelected in 2020 if, as many liberal TV viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency.
This will undoubtedly be the most tragic end to a presidency ever.
At this point, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewership.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million, and tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox New has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up 1.7 million from four years ago, Nielsen says, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
"This is a fire that people are reaching for, because it's something that we don't understand", said Neil Baer, the producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, a movie about a member of the government who becomes president after the Capitol collapses in an attack.
Neal Skovel, the veteran comedy writer who wrote "Just Funny Episodes: A Few Cruel Truths About Breaking Into the Boys' Club of Hollywood", has a different take.
He recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?" he asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh". Mrs. Skovell said.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything on TV, the plot lines coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wayne, whether immigrant families can join, and regardless of the health of the global economy.
The switch is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of unintended sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket, and Stormy Dennis's impeccable depiction of Trump, hmm, the anomaly.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario like I used to.
Speaking about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the script (fighting the NFL, stealing Kim Jong-un), Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, said, "To make it like a reality show, he specifically gives you something every day".
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll be left behind.
When I called Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and simultaneously taping CNN.
He couldn't pull himself out because Brett Kavanaugh was going to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing these crazy shows back in the day, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Outside money is flowing into the House of Representatives hot midterm elections
Not surprisingly, there's a huge amount of money flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, thanks to the redistricting that has resulted in the two current members of the House of Representatives vying for one seat.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is contested by Democrat Conor Lamb, a current member of the House who was elected from a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the current 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled last January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of Republicans.
In the newly formed 17th district, the race has led to a campaign finance race between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC), the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the March primary for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
For a decade, it was a Republican seat, and President Donald Trump won that seat by 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. even considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then backed out.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, facing little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until his colleagues fired him from the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only intended to target El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings continued, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any talk of sanctioning Salvadore.
Vice President Michael Pence is now expected to speak at the mid-October conference, in a sign of the administration's emphasis on the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh prompts or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which described three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about internal discussions on the condition that their names not be published.
Their assessments were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From the Past
The next step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice, for which there is very substantial evidence in public records.
They say Mr. Mueller is leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in its attacks on our elections.
If there is a change in leadership in Congress, Mr. Trump will be called to account in that body, just as he is about to meet again with voters, as well as possibly his peers in the legislature.
So there are a number of "ifs", and I don't intend to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovak representatives in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the chance to avoid years of slaughter.
These are turning points in history, and the development of the violent events of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Now Americans are living through these turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's intelligence?
Rosenstein has been in the news since this document revealed that last year he offered to secretly bug the president and questioned his eligibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
What would we do if the FBI investigation of Brad Kevinah, recently questioned, is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
But first, we will vote for Congress in a midterm election to which Mr. Trump will be accountable.
If we fail these tests, democracy will continue through the long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once seized my embassy.
He was saved by immigrating to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table by carrying a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?
Norman Eysen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Ethics and Accountability at Citizens in Washington, D.C., and the author of The Last Palace: A century of Europe's turmoil in five lives and one legendary home.
Ranger Graham Dorrance was optimistic before the crash of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria, which followed an impressive result for Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in high positions to qualify as Group G in the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury in the semi-final, Graham Dorrance was unable to participate in his first race of the season until the 2-2 result at Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to do bigger things.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are on the right side", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game believing that we would achieve something and we did.
Maybe we could have caught it in the end, in general, that the result of zero was probably fair.
They were probably playing better in the first round and we were playing better in the second round.
Thursday is another important European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good run in the last game, but, thanks to the crowd behind us, I'm sure we'll be able to push forward and have a positive result.
The last year has been difficult, no doubt, with all the things that have happened as a result of my injuries and the changes in the club, but the position is very pleasant.
The team is great, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is good.
Hopefully, now we can move on, put the previous season behind us and be successful.
Women lose their sleep because of the fear of saving money on dust.
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few of them talked to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
"People want their most vulnerable family members, but they don't take steps to talk like that", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
So that's where you start.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them what you want ahead of time.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss when and where you want to receive care, as these options can be a key factor in determining cost.
Your financial advisor can also help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your sources of funding for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash-and-value life insurance policies to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets as long as you have money.
Bring your legal documents. Avoid legal hassles.
Get your health care proxy so you have a trusted person to take care of your health care and make sure the professional meets your requirements in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, remember the importance of a lawyer to your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your payments are made if you're unable to work.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in need of medical attention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financiers who are working here, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the drugs?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have that plan.
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several shots from an air rifle.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home after a night walk.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as a "random operation".
The victim didn't see the shooter.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Papua on Friday, officials said, and more deaths are expected.
Due to the loss of communications, rescue workers were unable to obtain any information from the area of Dongola, the area in northern Palau that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Papua, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the islands of Sulawesi, Palau and Dongola.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated 2017 population of 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a region of more than 300 km (180 mi) in length on the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, which is an administrative region, has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the cornerstones of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially for the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also very important to the region, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, both Palu and Dongola have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and damaged hundreds of villages in Dongola.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: A major earthquake in the Aceh region of the west coast of Indonesia occurred in northern Sumatra on 26 December, affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes shook the West Coast region of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the northern part of Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami in the southern region, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Region.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A strong earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly and devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died because of collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The tremor destroyed hundreds of buildings and put thousands of tourists on temporary alert.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Treacy Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pelin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of interfering with a report of domestic violence and domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of the women tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she grabbed the phone.
Palin is in pre-trial detention at Man-Su and is being held on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he stood before the tribunal, where, when asked to accept the bribe, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Paley is facing a class A misdemeanor, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of using violence against his father, Todd Paley.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of domestic violence, and carrying a weapon in an uncontrollable state.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin came under heavy criticism from veterans groups after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of serving in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims there
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks have been disrupted, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The quake was recorded near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Video on social media shows the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered in the city of Palu to attend a beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attacks, which is rare.
In New York, federal judges are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saifov, a suspect in a terrorist attack that killed eight people. This is a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was allegedly attacked by a truck rented from Home Depot on the Side Highway bike path in Inner Manhattan, with pedestrians and cyclists hitting the road.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both articles allow for the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, the jury beat up Saipov, charging him with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for money laundering, which prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack required "exhaustive planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the shooting as "disgusting, cruel and immoral".
"Saifullo Habibuliyevich Saipov has caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicolas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damyan Pagnucho", the notice of intent said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time a death penalty case was brought before the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution by a federal court in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ether Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek citizen Saipov has not shown any signs of remorse for days and days.
The police say he told investigators he feels good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
He also asked for an Islamic State flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
One of the federal public defenders representing Saipovi, David Patton, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the death penalty, rather than the life sentence without the right to be free, will only prolong the suffering of all those involved in the events that led to these events", said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says the responsibility for Brexit negotiations should be placed on the Tory party.
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel the warmth of the Eurosceptics" as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would have left if Mr Farage had been a Brexit minister.
But Theresa May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been made more acute by her joining the anti-Brexit Tory Remain rally.
Amidst pro- and anti-Brexit backlash and attacks from the EU, the Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his "Shashke" compromise plan.
The supporters insisted that she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition, thus forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between the package she proposed and the Brexit.
Mr. Ben in Solihull, "Leaving means leaving", said during a protest that he wanted to "leave chess".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and put the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels on him.
"If he was in charge, we would be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must give up sugar".
In presenting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn denied the assumptions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Andrea Jenkins, a Brexit-conservative who was also at the rally, told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chess is not very popular, the opposition is not bothered to vote for it, it is not in sympathy with our party and the activists who first took to the streets and voted for us.
Please stop playing chess and start listening.
In a blunt statement to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that the politicians participating in the march should be made to "feel the heat" if they are on the verge of reversing the decision they made in 2016.
"Today it is a question of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you cheat it.
In a message to an excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class feel the warmth of the Brexit betrayal.
We are mobilizing an army of the people of this country who gave us our victory in Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
Several activists were waving Tory flags against Brexit flags after the group formed last week.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives at the opening of the conference over security concerns over their party's mobile app.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT technology for Canada plus plus plus to have a free trade border with Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
A longtime critic of President Donald Trump, Warren has announced his candidacy for re-election in November, running against Republican Jeff Dill, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign co-chairman.
There are rumors that he may challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was Trump's 36th town hall meeting with voters since he became president.
One of the people in the audience asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and rebuild the failed government, including the highest office.
An arrest has been made in the shooting death of LSU's Sims.
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET press release.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the Southern University student center Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and got himself shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene and armed and confessed to shooting Wade Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-one-inch-inch (1.98 m) third-year senior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian grandmaster Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Cup champion when a team strategy gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment that Walter Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team tactics would play a big part in the race.
On the first lap, Bottas started well and nearly crushed Hamilton, holding his position for the first two turns and urging Vettel to attack his teammate.
The throw was the first to go bad and allow Hamilton to hit the tail of the block, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes later entered the lap and started behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead with a sharp step, which reluctantly took the Ferrari driver off the inside track, in danger of being blocked after making a double step to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the starting grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race and was aiming to get close to the finish line and pass Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finally got a point in the 44th lap, but was unable to pick up speed in the remaining eight laps, while Ryckonen was fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valter worked so hard all weekend and he was a gentleman and let me pass.
"The team did an extraordinary job, one or two goals", Hamilton said.
Body language was a very unsuccessful manifestation
President Donald Trump mocked the race after Senator Dianne Feinstein insisted she had not circulated a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were evil and crafty and lying.
"The only thing that could have happened, and the only wonderful thing that's happened in the Senate over the last two days, is that you've seen anger, you've seen angry people and bad people and crooks and liars", he said.
When you read the press reports and the news, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you share the information?
Remember his answer -- did you distribute the document?
Oh, no, not you.
I'm not spreading it.
Okay, wait a minute.
Have we spread -- "No, we haven't spread", he added, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter from Ford alleging Kavanaugh, and earlier in September, it was circulated, but Feinstein denied that his office had circulated it.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't spread his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did.
But his denial was not well received by the president, who commented on the race on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a very unsuccessful display of body language.
It may not have spread, but I've never seen body language fail like this.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually harassing three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
They are prepared to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the cunningness: they don't care who they hurt, who they overwhelm in order to gain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants defeated by the Red Devils in the final
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars took a draw from the Elite League side on Friday, winning 5-3 in a rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead, thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kaunini tied the score, after which Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee, then Lucas Lanvald Niels' goals ensured them a win.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's Elite League side, who had been promoted to the top flight by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The first goal for the Dwyers came at 3:35 from Kendall McFall, with David Rutherford passing and Boiler doubling the lead four minutes later.
In the first round, Sullivan changed the course of the game for the home side at 13:10 minutes, then equalized the score at 15:16 minutes with the help of Matt Markward.
Due to Dwyer, the Giants' luck was on the mend when he scored his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first inning.
The owners of the field reorganized and Buscar again equalized their score with a goal scored in the 27:37 minute with a majority advantage.
Curran and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure the first ever Dundee lead at the end of the second period, and he did everything he could to help his team win the fifth game of the final round.
The Giants, now down four of their five, are back home in Milton Keynes, preparing for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies, saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after taking all the necessary measures to safely fly a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to hit the area, and in the city of Palu, many people are trapped under the rubble.
Twenty-one-year-old Antonius Ganawan Agung refused to leave his post in the violently shaken control tower at Muttiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing.
He remained in his position and did everything possible to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could be safely lifted into the air.
He then jumped off the traffic tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia's Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Siret said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
"We were heartbroken when we heard about it", he added.
At the same time, authorities believe the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's Disaster Management Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Siji and Butong is restricted.
"The death toll may be higher because there are still many bodies under the rubble and some cannot be removed", said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated Palau, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are delivering aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Riza Kusuma, told Sky News: "Emergency services are bringing in bodies every minute.
Fresh water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The International Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will encounter.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau and told the country's military, "I'm asking all of you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation task".
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit Lombok, Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashes in the Gulf.
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean island of Micronesia now says one person is missing. Earlier it reported that all 47 passengers and crew on board were successfully evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, there was one male passenger missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger (age or nationality).
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Trucq Island airport.
On Friday, the authorities said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday, six passengers were still in the hospital, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in a bay near the runway.
Some of the mines think the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had descended too low.
"This is a very good thing", said Janez.
Jains said he and the others managed to reach the crash exit of the sinking plane in water up to their waists.
He said the dispatchers were screaming in panic, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The US Navy said that boats repairing the nearby dock also assisted the rescue efforts, bringing people ashore in a paddleboat before the vessel sank approximately 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timeline of the night of the murder of his wife
On Saturday, the court resumed its investigation of a man who burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, has been a witness to hours of testimony in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to match the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellesi, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said she received a location information from several cell phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting her earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was next to Chambers's phone at the time he says he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified from the witness box that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Telles was telling the truth about spending the night in the Sanford truck, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Telles said he knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellese deleted his messages, phone calls and contact details from his phone.
"She's erased him from her life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jurors that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative attitudes towards this style of music by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, argues that hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social problem solving.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip-hop conscious popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blackbird?
New York City nanny sues couple for firing her after racist post
A New York City nurse sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message sent to the wrong address that said she was "just another black person".
The husbands deny being racist and compare the lawsuit to "money laundering".
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern about learning that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she took the job on her first day in 2016.
"I love you", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a note to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After realizing his mistake, an embarrassed Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying their current midwife, who is African-American, had done a bad job and that he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for severance pay and expects $350 for every day of the six months he was hired to live at the workplace, even though they didn't sign a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism against them, saying that it was wise to fire Morris because they feared that after hurting him, they would no longer be able to trust him.
My wife sent him something he wasn't going to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby.
Stop that!
Comparing the lawsuit to a "money laundering", Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
And you're going after someone like him?
"That's not a good thing", the investment bank added.
Although the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to criticize the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would connect with the talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter, "It's hard to imagine you as someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know today what we know about Paddington's tremendous success.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book about the little bear, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had stirred up conflicting feelings after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she considers a "privileged member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of her potential success.
"He was a very calm man, and not a boastful person", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a kid who's accomplished something, you're proud of it, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in some ways.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he had a habit of giving credit to Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the operation, her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought to save her life.
"Ned called regularly to say that things were really bad, that he wouldn't be able to cope with it", said Mrs. Edna Laperuse.
"Then I got a call from Ned, who said he was going to die in a few minutes, and I had to say goodbye to him".
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were slowly losing their power and leaving his body.
He had died some time before that, and that was the end of it.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that this wasn't going to work out.
I couldn't yell or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep my composure.
Finally, Miss Edna Laperuz, still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, forgetting the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knows", he said.
I was hanging my head and tears were flowing all the way.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I had a deep, deep affection for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The women were crying out to the bridges to avoid suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to stop other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were writing open letters on the Welsh Bridge with encouraging appeals and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Miss Davis' son Taylor was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his laugh.
They always said her smile lit up the room.
However, he had left his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Miss Davis said, "I'm always afraid that it will have devastating consequences".
Miss Davis made the cards to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent, you need to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who had been a longtime friend of Miss Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything like that", he said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in a terrible mood at Christmas, when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye, and so on.
She said that his death was a huge shock to them, but they had to get over it.
It's just ruining us.
But we all have to stand up and fight.

Brad Cavina's fate hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, the investigation has a limited time, a limited scope, we could achieve unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would split under military-like restrictions.
Why Mr. Kevnah and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation.
Their complaints are only about time.
With just five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6th, if Republicans like this one lose, their attempts to elect anyone to the nation's highest court will be significantly diminished.
George W. Bush would pick up the phone and call the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kevinah, who worked for Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report comes in?
There's a Senate election coming up, and 51 percent of the Senate is Republican, 49 percent is Democrat.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kavinah will be able to get 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence a chance to achieve parity and establish himself on the Supreme Court.
North Korean lawlessness has decreased since Kim's time.
North Korea's crime rate has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the North Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from the Northern Joint Ministry, said there were 1,127 breaches last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the high tariffs imposed on smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually acquire South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats those who seek asylum as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the possibility of ending the use of nuclear weapons.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-hee blamed the U.S. sanctions for the decline in success since they were imposed.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust in our national security, and in these circumstances, we cannot unilaterally declare a ceasefire", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brad Kevinya a "hysteric", says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brad Kavina "hysterical" and said he was "not qualified" to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acts like that, she's called a "hysteric", Pelosi said Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to the Keweenaw demonstration.
Kevinah has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blaise Ford when they were both young.
During his opening speech, Kevinah was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and yelling when talking about his family and his school years.
He also blamed the Republicans on the committee, calling the accusations against him "ridiculous nonsense" by organized liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she thought Kevina's testimony proved that she couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that she was anti-Republican.
"I think he's disqualified himself by his statements and his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was stunned when asked if she would try to impeach Keveniah if he were confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but the court where he's sitting right now", Pelosi said.
Kevin is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kevinnah against the Matchel Health Act or the Row Wade controversy, as he is considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kevinah avoided questions about whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's clear rulings.
"Now is not the time for a fanatic and a partisan to go to court and say, 'How wonderful!' " said Pell.
And the woman has to master it.
It's a fair criticism, it's the rage of months and years pouring out, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinman told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, is it?
And she went on: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was running a place, who said she also cries when she's angry, but she's developed a trick that suggests that when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm mad at you.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, that's great.
Tears are allowed, especially to release resentment, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest working memories in an office that was dominated by men was when I was caught one day crying in a fit of rage, and a woman a year older than me, a chill manager who I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the back and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", he said to me.
They don't know you're crazy.
They think you're sad, and they'll be glad they hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with presidential candidate Gary Hart in the primaries.
In 1987, when she was caught with a woman on the Monkey Business-running boat and accused of having an extramarital affair, she came home from the race. Deeply disappointed, Ms. Schroeder felt there was no reason why she should not consider running for office herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they wanted.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, he was lagging behind in fundraising, and he vowed not to fight unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that her supporters, who would give the man $1000, would only give her $250.
"What, they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech announcing that he would not be officially campaigning, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported him, anger at the system that made it so hard to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, anger at the sexism) that he was stumbling.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown", said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling the way the press reacted to her.
You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember him wondering what would be written on my tombstone.
"She cried".
Like the US-China trade war, it could be good for China.
The first round of trade tensions between the United States and China have been disruptive, and the fight between the two countries could benefit China in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week when new tariffs were imposed, affecting $200 million (£150 million) worth of goods, in fact, half of all Chinese imports to the US.
Beijing has responded with a vengeance, most recently imposing a 5-10% tax on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate with the United States, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be extremely embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing can use its cards right, trade pressure from the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that hasty policy decisions in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for economic deadlock in both countries is actually more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers", said Abigail Regress, a senior fellow at the newly established Center for Asian Studies in American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation is more stable and secure", he said.
To restore normalcy, the government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists.
Today, all the conditions are in place to ensure the return of refugees to the countries they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he noted that it would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
Europe celebrates victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive European matches and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title after Denmark's captain Thomas Bjørn's team won 14.5 points, which was needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Nicholson, who had been fighting for most of the tournament, sent the ball into the water after the third stroke, losing the game to Francesco Molinari in the 16th inning.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in every round, becoming one of only four players since 1979 to have won 5-0-0 in the tournament.
Jordan Speight of the United States was eliminated by 5-4 by Thorbjørn Olsen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player in the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Paul Poulter, who may have been the last player to compete in the Ryder Cup.
Eight-Rider veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain, with 25.5 points, became the tournament's all-time leading scorer in Europe.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I was able to be useful", said Garcia, who was excited after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles match on Sunday.
"I have an incredible sense of pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3.
It's an odd statistic for one of the most famous players to have won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament, the entire US team struggled to find their way through the weekend.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, speaking after a disappointing game for the team, said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, at some point, we put pressure on the Europeans.
We broke up.
I take my hat off in front of Thomas.
He is a genius.
His 12 players did very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to work with the Professional Golfers Association of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their eldest.
You have to be able to serve.
We were outnumbered.
Red wave update: Concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are down
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reports that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
The district contract reports active blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red-flowered plantation extends approximately 130 miles (208 km) from Pinellas in the north to the southern districts of Lee.
Areas can be found within 10 miles (16 km) of the coast in Hillsborough County, but less frequently than last week.
The Red Wave was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were observed in or near Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in the border areas of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Mantee County and Sarasota and coastal counties, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in the coastal areas of Lee County, and low concentrations in the Colorado area.
In Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, and Lee counties, respiratory tract infections are still being reported.
No cases of pneumonia have been reported in the past week.
