What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "knocked" members of the new council out of the ČSSD, how they control the notorious slang, which has been naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era by Lord Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the best known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were doing something in the dark in relation to the new terms.
At least they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am a beginner in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "godfather of vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "gold hole".
"This is the only expression of those that you are presenting to me here, whom I use every now and then."
"Otherwise I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz this June before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Socialists and Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Golfloch", "go to the confectionery shop", "Stiernacken", "Verrat der Hauptstadt" and "verblechen".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation, but did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge."
"For me, it is important how we understand our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have recognized in the headline mentioned above that there is talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly suggested when testing was "the biggest gol-hole in Prague".
"This is the tunnel Blanka", says Kaucký, but added to security: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even anticipates where this figure can be found and what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that is to go to some Prague gastronomy establishment", Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party associates.
"I was called Bříza (birch) in school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party companions friendly the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by machinations at the party sponsor, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego's figure).
Nicknames are the only ones that the Social Democrats allow in their internal language.
Hulínský allegedly does not like it when called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons" is allegedly due to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"This is also spared young and healthy women because they help with their work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation that in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso takes care of more than one hundred women who were expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason issued a brochure to prevent the "witch persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written clarification.
It is also common practice to be accused of witchcraft in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27 year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and simply ignited them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil was inflamed, which was used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "expel" an evil spirit from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42 year old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Female eaters of human souls are a danger as they do today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse witch-hunt, last year the President of the Gambia has mixed the President himself.
"After the death of his aunt, President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share of their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, illegally kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an abundance of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the locked people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure were the nearly thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: he heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An older man leaves the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "charcoal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for his own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is just serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased the rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, next year the son is to cover up 4100 crowns for a two bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And since in the apartment there is not even flowing warm water and heating it is necessary in a simple coal-fired oven", it annoys with a finger on the new lease of the son for whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-dissatisfied and half-resigned.
The Civil Association of BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man only waves away.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is before most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-appropriate rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Rent 2011", so a special keypad lights up on the touchscreen.
Shortly typed and already the device spits out a number list.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already it peeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - requests for repair, insurance and the like.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new rental contracts will flutter into the mailboxes for most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes in the letter a tenant increase of approx. 15 to 38 per cent.
The special counter for new rentals in the Client Centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning", the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment of hesitation, when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala ’ s former miners ’ homes are a controversial issue.
Prior to the elections, Lubomír Zaorálek, President of Parliament from the ČSSD, who came from Ostrava, took up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne besch. WC's glasses could change them", the man mentioned at the beginning makes air.
Up to now, employees say that pensioners in particular are at the desk to see if they really receive the promised rental discount, which RPG promises when they sign the special offer on time.
The other tenants who sign the new rental agreement by 15 December will also benefit from half a reduced February rent.
Until now, however, "deregulation switches" in Havířov are anything but overloaded with demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre at least partially justifies her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees become uncertain.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011, and according to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty residential portfolio and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the hired tenants is the main reason for the rent increase according to the owner.
Whereas RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from rents taken between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov a few bright red information appear in between.
"Rental increases in 2011 by 15% and fewer affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"These cases are about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rent remains the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not increase rents in leaps and bounds, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further obligation: All income from the rental increase (see chart) wants to put the company back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But, as a matter of priority, these should benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase in tenants.
The architects saw one - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole series of well-known Brno buildings originate, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its companies.
In wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees are aged in the baby boom and the company is keen that the project managers return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
Construction engineers have made it easier for them to reconcile their demanding profession and childcare.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design ’ s employees and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and operations are provided.
After the utilization of the subsidies (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue the Minikindergarten 3 further years at own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the implementation of the application.
The children are taken care of by full-time qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a Mini Kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it concerns individual education and care, the content of the program in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable with the accompanying program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic insights to preschool lessons, besides they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, thus eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore make more productive use of their working hours.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employers are developing relationships here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies, which offer clear benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn up fishmongers.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau by Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only when you look more closely that you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
During the night, the entire façade appears even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination reinforces the shine of the colours.
The same swinging lines and twisted forms dominate the interior of the house.
Wave shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Grácia street no. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese executed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally consisted of the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí ’ s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on its drawing board the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of reality were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
For example, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí ’ s Casa Milá in the Güell Park, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gähnende house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces, which was unique at that time.
A bit bizarre, her 45 degrees inclination already seems.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and was by no means dismayed by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so appalled by the result that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors also encountered, among other things, the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the invitation to do so by the district Josep Batlló submitted an application for the letting of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building crosses a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the reconstruction all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by the opening of the salon doors and thus a larger society could comfortably chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more confidential discussions.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí ’ s renovation gave the house a rather unusual roof and two further floors.
Gaudí ’ s play with light, as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the light houses, is also impressive.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is open to everyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and splendid apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was discovered that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the monument is however no cardboard handle, it is 16.50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed base? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, they must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and last but not least the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust are subordinated is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "get warm".
Furthermore, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: So it is not excluded that under their mold forms.
Of course, what you are used to plays a role in your choice.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“Probably all hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can ’ t sleep properly here. ”
"For their secluded shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory for polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can poorly receive the" information "from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That ’ s why I bought many ice hockey players years ago, as well as other customers, these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don ’ t have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night one does not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, one should still add the length of the soles to the body size, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are 180 cm tall need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of lying width, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior fitters, who has been dedicating herself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also to technical schools to this topic.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise there is nothing else left but to mount the grates at different heights and that is far from possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be omitted on the form layer and the finest padding.
"You must not feel the feathers by hand or by putting them down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Full padded beds with mattress and underlay like grown together Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already in progress today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve after five to seven years.
For this reason, experts reject advertising slogans that promise a service life of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its When and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which one can easily remove and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with a circular zip closure, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often looks like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do you have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also so they should use the plate rather with ventilation holes (if there are no ones in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a backing.
For non-adjustable slatted slats with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut), always grates with a larger number of slats, i.e. of 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar slats support and the possibility to regulate the slats hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeleton belong to adjustable lamella grates, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Namely for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, dotted elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grates with dotted elastic contact are designed for pads with so-called multitorsion suspension.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and too full) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears ideal, as the Scandinavians like it for example.
In the side position the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used for mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils such as castor and soy oil are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of mattresses made of natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm while sleeping.
And today ’ s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with a destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and much more flexible).
Due to the combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco and foams, more zones are created, which know exactly where the head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to overlap.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to gain this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a Visco foam memory cover for 11,990 CZK.
The second one you get for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the take-off.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, solidified in cool surroundings.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which should facilitate the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use for example the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people to have surveillance equipment to control the kids
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system, originally invented to search for cars, can indeed locate people as well, which would also help in such cases as the recent untraceable disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS positioning devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example if you put it into someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we had no such case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At first, the mobile phones awakened great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the event of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices may be helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers locating services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do smart mobile phones with navigation, only a special software needs to be installed.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that this is either about matchboxes of matchbox size, similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a danger that they will be lost.
Mr. Pilin von der Macro Because, therefore, in the present day, devices that look like normal digital watches are tested.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or positioning device.
"Or he only realizes after some time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in vehicle positioning.
So the combination of the positioning function with the GPS system (just like with the navigation system in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic you keep but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, are ignited with explosive devices.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, at most but four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the public limited company STV Group, a. s. for lousy 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this enormous quantity of ignition cord the general staff MF DNES answered that the soldiers would consume annually to the 60 kilometers ignition cord.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to it, this statement shows that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be reasonably justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of ignition cord are completely sufficient for training each new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, also from the point of view of the increased demand of the pioneering and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for small arms, so shooting exercises are severely restricted because of the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"Nor do I understand why they buy such tons of ignition cords from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we want to meet as much as possible as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition by saying that the army would have covered up this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"In perfect storage, the four aforementioned years are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not jeopardising the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume rebate for the 445 kilometres of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," Spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, for a few years hardly exceeds 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of these ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the service life.
Already because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition one keeps the possibility to flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords open.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty when the two-hundred thousand Czechoslovak People ’ s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I am interested in the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytloun helped the winning placement in the "Small Business of the Year" competition to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year".
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that in Liberec there are no good overnight accommodation options at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price of quality at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit in the house, which he then converted step by step to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotel have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Great part of this licensing sale for the operation of hotels had just won the competition" Entrepreneur of the Year ", Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances, which otherwise would not have happened at all.
"To this day, I have regular business relations with some people I have met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also beats a little on each of his employees.
And there he hath to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really do not see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name has only slightly moved to the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Karel Žďárský, owner of Farmet, accepted the award for the first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts made by him to stamp a company out of the ground from the small tool shop in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition", says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet ’ s history there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then run and founded his father's own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades.
Shortly afterwards they started to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization did it also enter the consciousness of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to attach greater value," says Karel Žďárský.
The past year, however, was not only marked by victory at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less citizens, but above all businesses, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in investments in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training centre, reinforced our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner much joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that clears up with senseless rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" was the obligation to create documents available online to authorities.
More than a third of not quite four thousand entrepreneurs voting.
Thus the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register in the event of checks by social security payers," said ČSSZ Spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations, to fulfil the business in the Czech Republic and to remove the nonsense.
This is already for the fourth time part of an entrepreneur competition, which is organized by the German business newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
Last year, when the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"As far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, for example, we rank first in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity in recent years is the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of terms and conditions, and 8th in terms of the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
For registration the web address www.firmaroku.cz. After that the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote over the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been notified on this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay tolls for motorways and expressways, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to pay tolls every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition in Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening, in which regularly also personalities of political and public life participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Commercial Operators of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the event at the height of the competition.
Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade, said: "Where the state puts entrepreneurs in a stick, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today."
The efforts to create senseless orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, people most affected the entrepreneurs imposed duty to notify the commercial office at the site of their permanent premises three days in advance of the intention to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was abolished by means of an amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposing physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speaking room was chosen.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair undertakings.
"We want to support such companies, which are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition of the company of the year, companies registered, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and provides enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about people who are handicapped, for example, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit and Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
Also a paper mill from Poděbrady takes exemplary care of its health-handicapped employees, which make up 70 per cent of its workforce, for which it was honoured with the title "Responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone company of the year it took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without any proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company buys predominantly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens ’ initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is located in the health of its employees and therefore has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, furthermore it promotes home work for its employees and in company actions it uses cartering for services offered by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the" People in Need "Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes their employees to their pension insurance in the form of Extra Bonussen.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, qualification and holiday", says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian region of Silesia.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year all district finalists of the competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the registration and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition" Responsible Company of the Year ", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, since it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year", explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrested in the last few days.
The local media company and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to settle claims for restitution in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific prospective customer.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent activities in public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", who cannot provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46 year old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way it could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it, given the scarce official information.
Spokesperson of the Soil Fund Lubomír Černá mentioned Právo's question in this regard that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsen subsidiary of Soil Fund during public competition.
"It was about a client and not one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "Invitation to tender claims for land transfer under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons offer in the context of the invitation a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer, than the proclaimed property value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, then the Soil Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson for the fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal, who had registered for the request and because he was himself a legitimate person, because he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a land interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Soil Fund, which was prosecuted because he published land in substitute restitutions, on which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. acquired land intended for the construction of public roads at the site where the construction of the access magistral to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time the town hall had to give heavy heart small enclosures, in order not to endanger the building project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and rents for district heating and some places.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns per month more from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some places also increase the price of district heating supplies.
The price of electricity costs several hundred crowns per year.
The heavy electricity prices were reduced by all main suppliers, thus the reason is the clear support of the electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Gas will only be moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, several hundred crowns are to be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Primarily larger places plan price increases.
For example, from January, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for district heating, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is, however, still one of the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are to be expected for example in 140,000 rented apartments, in which starting from January the so-called renting regulation is omitted.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, is planning to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
Those who disagree with this increase in tenants want to be prosecuted by the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar to the father.
These are the drinks that require the most emergency treatment for drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital again and again.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children ’ s departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the children's department in the Central Bohemian Clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to deprive the father of a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then it does not smell so strong", the chief physician explains.
The spokesperson for the Motol Eva Jurinová Faculty Hospital is right.
"The most common thing is fernet or rum."
"This is the current trend in alcohol, especially at primary schools."
"Occasionally it was also about Slibowitz, which one takes from home", Mrs. Jurinová led.
According to Chief Physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers have long been no exception in hospitalization.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first delivered with 3.5% alcohol in her blood and in combination with" Extase "," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange at all, that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
Particularly the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when starting with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in the true sense of the word on children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all the related phenomena, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family background is characteristic, "explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson for the Motol Hospital, Mrs. Jurinová, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of child and youth medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home by parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only once a bottle of brandy in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief because of bad testimony or because of pleasure on holiday."
"During the Walpurgis Night I also experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has to fight the next day only with an unpleasant hangover.
The headaches in the morning, which come from dehydration and glucose control, can be expelled in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are definitely better off, because after the" splendid "experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting somewhere."
"They are only a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Every now and then I used this as a means of education when I calculated directly to the children at the Visite what cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work over the whole holiday in order to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to recourse procedures in order to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircrafts for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light L ‑ 159 aircraft out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C -295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen in maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is about the airworthy two-seater version L and 159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L and 159.
These are currently still conserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when it physically expedes the aircraft from Vodochody.
The single-seater combat aircraft L and 159, in turn, were separated from long-term aircraft without further deposits and investments from the Ministry ’ s department.
"The double-seat L 159T1 was exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater fighter aircraft, as in May 2009 the Defense Ministry signed with Aero Vodochody a 200-seater contract for the conversion of four superfluous L159 to the two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to enforce the fighter aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the customer of the aircraft L159 and that they should serve as training for pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the consumer how he realizes the thing," Pejšek said.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L ’ 159.
The five-litre barter 159 against a cargo aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not advertised a tendering procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which they only used 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission, in fact, sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason is that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a European call for tender and not by appealing to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one is scheduled to land at Kbely airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This should be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health strains, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period from 1994 to 2009 she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk however fell by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research revealed that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was fleeting acquainted with this study, but he did not consider the relationship between finger-length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and paths there is mostly frozen snow, the winter servicers were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague "stands".
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Car of Motoclub (ÚAMK).
At km 91 a truck had an accident, at km 93 two trucks came together, in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the trench.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The riders should depart immediately behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
This is where kilometres of traffic jams are formed.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen form for example in the part of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams are delayed, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast trains due to snow drifts.
There are problems for example on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be absolutely informed about the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyně is closed from Wednesday 11 am to 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno snow drifts form in places and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow mills on some higher-altitude roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snowblowers will have to be used to clean the snow.
Until now, it is not possible to estimate when they can be driven again.
Caution is needed in the region of Hodonín in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be sprinkled with inert scattering agents for nature conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick, ČTK stated.
In the Czech Republic snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
In Moravian Silesian region fell up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow.
But in the Czech Republic it stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon for the first time in Afghanistan, which is so far known only under their code name XM25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the relationship of forces to their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the finish by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special projectiles of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this gun and contain highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
This means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splintering rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to press off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the weapon loads and shoots the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workstations from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs in the group that have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, in addition, the large office in the Astro Park would better accommodate the working methods of the employees.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt's Niederrad".
Excellent connections to the airport are particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt business department Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was another "global player".
This is a "great profession of location".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management about the intention.
"We offered the company our help, of course," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the Town Hall Square and the adjacent "Small Vertical", which Fujitsu used so far, were among the most controversial building projects in the spa town with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entree emerged between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partially used parking areas and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, purchased the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu counts far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt and the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the Zentralverband Elektrotechnik- und Elektronikindustrie has its seat among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats against ∑
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks' founding party is said to be in England.
The Wikileaks unveiling platform is getting under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileak ’ s founding founder Julian ∑, who is on Interpol ’ s search lists, is supposed to be in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks suppressed by Amazon's server."
"Free speech in the country of the free", reported the revelation activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks ’ documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had relied on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle the high number of access documents when publishing the secret diplomatic dispatches.
On Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman ’ s staff did research, CNN reported citing Lieberman ’ s office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman meanwhile called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless approach is jeopardising our national security and jeopardising life around the globe," it says in a message from the non-partisan senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks' founding member ∑, who is being sought by the authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39 year-old Australian is in Great Britain, the exact place is known Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after the assassination of Julian ∑."
Hrafnsson therefore rightly feared for his safety.
The Wikileaks founder will keep hiding.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the Wikileaks officials be accused of betrayal and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to Head of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television, ∑ should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a swap between the White House and ∑ broke out.
US President Barack Obama ’ s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd, ” that Netanyahu had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for recent spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its own website."
The American government is now extensively testing the protection of its databases.
The White House announced that Russell Travers, Vice President of the Anti Terror Center, had been appointed as Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary following Wikileaks' disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to check how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the Wikileaks release.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, spokesman for the Office.
"We stand ready to protect them if that becomes necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna ice cream editors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest admission and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little antiquity the Ice Conditor, produces the cream according to all rules of Italian icemaking art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the counter with a spatula, paints it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, do not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you won't pass the "Gelato" University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice cream university has established the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest admission and visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses for chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to do something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro and Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget, however, the icing on the icing of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice.
Immediately, the lecturer is confronted with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to one's own desire for experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course you can produce ice without stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks in itself, and the customer bites on all ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seduction.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano produces four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice-cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
Fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit and puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut Ice-cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi Ice Cream manufactures the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will really enhance the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a computational task: If peach is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano produces a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamy beaten and cooled to minimum temperatures.
Despite small breakdowns, all automation does not stop.
The Brazilian Gustavo tastes himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, when the oversized stick blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like this happens."
Controllers in twilight
The European Food Authority (Efsa) is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, now formulates this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech's head Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in working on the Efsa Genetic Plant Test Regulations and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations are identical with the position papers of the Ilsi and thus lie with the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech criticised a collision of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa CEO has recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or transitional period - and has thus changed sides.
Also the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had recently revealed personnel connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbies, which the Federal Environmental Agency as well as EU parliamentarians have made clear.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, should be taken back as long as they are of high technical quality, is stated in an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any feeding experiments and that the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genomic plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, then how can you find them?" Then asks with accusation.
Angelika Hilbeck sees that as well.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe, as in the US.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, altogether about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was standing on his back at Stuttgart station, the Tuba.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September the excavators had moved and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing lay in rubble.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone Reich.
The 44 year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who came to Stuttgart during the demolition.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground into gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden tub that once was a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened when he was in the newspapers in September when he bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S's 21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything about the demolition.
And if it happens, then it is the most reasonable thing if the stones are used further.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilograms heavy quader with them, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of returning it to reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house watchers.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of impulse have long since changed into "mäuerle" or into limits of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Would not be the political component."
He climbs into his off-road vehicle, making a tour through his 20 hectares empire.
Jura he studied and aborted, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
He maps his treasures from all over Germany.
He says that he is the republic ’ s largest Altsteinhändler.
He is slowing down.
In the snow lie artistically hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he raves.
"My favourite stone."
The path goes up through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the quaders belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckar stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox-cart, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if we were to shred something like this."
He has not become rich, not at all.
But 14 people are employed today by the stonemasons, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the leftist.
He will soon have to go to Cologne.
Also there are stones to save.
Talent struggle for high power potentials
There is a lively rush at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition they are to get to know Volkswagen together with VW developers about the car of the future.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now in close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Her mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities don ’ t publish presentations about the achievements of their students, they try to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the car concerts advertise the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW's logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that it is so offensive to the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the freshly graduated will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they have to pay prices and especially balting for highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering sites remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI, the so-called engineering gap will become even larger.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent.
He organizes elaborate recruiting event like the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which the participants have to find their way by means of GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the US next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG ’ s branches and get to know the company.
Who is allowed with, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials are cut and cut at universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta the bill seems to go up.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to finish and want to apply soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bushing on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular are also playing the game at trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"At Intersolar, for example," reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Human Resources at Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 posts on the company ’ s website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university of the professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialists.
The company tries to promote this with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer this," says Personnel Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute produces an annual list of best German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also benefit job seekers.
"I think that applicants look especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the jargon of the industry, internal employer branding is called, i.e. employer brand training within the own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would promote their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
"This is like a game with ties," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US federal state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has adopted a prohibition on this, thereby definitively revoking its earlier plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is forbidden for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which will apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters want to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finalised.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
An investigative commission commissioned by Obama is expected to present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the drill stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tougher controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude another disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before by stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", is the result of a current industry survey by BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of exploited crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it is good.
"Do not plague yourself," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to unravel a boy wading to the chest in the water with the stripes surrounding him: In the rainbow colored water sparkle the scene seems almost pretty.
That under the surface brown crude oils float is not to be seen.
She used to collect prawns here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the sluggish waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil were poured into the huge wetland from a bored pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-rich waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerdelta, is considered one of the worst-leased regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise out of the ground like black licorice poles, sad to let the palm trees hanging their weddings.
Bird-swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, one seeks in vain: As soon as the outboarder is silent, spooky rest spreads in the former paradise, smelling like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni area is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded it, in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro and Wiwa, the first resistance was organized here, where the Shell group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still unable to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped from the entire delta region of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines per day, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the situation for the group.
Every few hundred meters steel frames rise like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the marrow.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil enters the water.
More than two billion litres have flowed into the delta ’ s ecosystem in 50 years according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil as it penetrated into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the event of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez ” – one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the persistent eco-catastrophe will argue about it.
While Shell Corporation sabotage and organized oil theft accounts for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and licking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the corporation in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone was "many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air from a distance, the mangrove figures emerge: they are fragmented naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the terrain, a fire flickles: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the chief of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later dripping out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel at 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooker can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euros per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It originates from "bunkers", which tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way the country according to experts in the entire Nigerdelta daily at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate commodity is illegally refined: the lion ’ s share is filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankers and fling it into the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the displacement of the population or the lax mode of production is considered by the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell was so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group could be called into question: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese would turn out to be better."
There Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil finishers are caught by the special force of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, soldiers from the northern part of the country also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of an emergency machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of Qantas Airbus, who were in need, apparently had much more luck than they have known so far: The Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 and now warns against a possible construction defect.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose compound, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The engines manufactured by Rolls and Royce were affected in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney to allow him to take further legal action against the company.
Qanta's CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
At the fire of the engine parts had dissolved and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls and Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls and Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land wide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany completely in white: Over night almost all over the country snow has fallen.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights fall off.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowing on Thursday at night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are some 15 centimeters thick snow ceilings.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office of Maritime Affairs and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore purple - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
In Saxony, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to the German Railways, considerable disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokesperson for the flight information centre.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, they still had almost 400 beds available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was detected at a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30 year old woman died after she had overrun herself with her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth street.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore whirl up in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt ’ s banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a speaker.
The speaker did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany ’ s largest credit institution is relinquishing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the double towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euro from the investors of an in-house fund and afterwards elaborately renovated.
According to the figures, the energetic conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" according to the newspaper to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands mourn for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered, because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried under days.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no emergency personnel could descend due to safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddy could be seen.
Pictures and personal objects, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags blew on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit into the Kunstkino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores new boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and uses almost superhuman forces to redirect his opponents - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and even the other figures can at most be torn to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, the scenery of the viking world of about a thousand years ago will remain silent in the creepy hills of Scotland.
Ideal for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and styled drug dealer, director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humour or a little less brutality.
Most art cinemas are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and the bowels.
The fans of the action will die of boredom at the latest, when an eye, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and fixes an eternity in loud and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a shame especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides, which deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a strict plot, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And from that there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and, with his icy pictures and the dark trance like soundtrack, slowly tightens his throat, especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, standing faithfully at the side of the eye, preserves something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, agitate and wonder.
An experience.
Enigmatic earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - it still allows controls.
Around midnight on September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F 15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as of Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the block with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the stream.
According to a letter from the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, which was also known as the nearby village of El Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded where what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor stood shortly before the commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly any more is known than at that time, yes, the puzzles became larger over time.
Former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, there was little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
When asked how certain he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidically that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians hurriedly set aside the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, a team of IAEA leaders under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans.
Furthermore, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from a Member State directly after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always asserted that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But after analyzing the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it forbids inspectors a second inspection in El Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel too is silent about iron.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
Since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area over which the IAEA is guarding.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "in functional contact" with the presumed reactor as the key to progress in the reconnaissance process - and that still exist differently from that.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are, nor what function they have or what they appear suspicious.
According to information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as and Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and identified a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or directly adjacent to a military base - on this very grounds, Syria is refusing access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military operations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid at Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from it, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the rubble has remained.
The IAEA is considered unlikely to be the only salt mine on the other side of the Euphrates, located just a few kilometres away from El Kibar, Al Tibni, which Syria examined for its suitability as a radioactive waste camp in 1998.
Former IAEA ’ s inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane ’ s Intelligence Review magazine.
Recordings from the orbit show, however, that Syria did earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
Moreover, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors are.
But Damascus also ironed off this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna appealed a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, therefore the matter did not have a high urgency, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA head Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this direction: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directing debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
One does not know much more about it - but already that is enough for unrest.
The rumour that the woman, a Muslim woman, remains persistent in her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, whereupon some filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatically - she offered a meeting to the women weeks ago in Hungary, which she rejected.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, its organisation has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read its screenplay, issued a filming permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself claims that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslavia ’ s conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis on the film is circulating on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and met again when, a Bosnian Muslim woman, she was abducted to a Serbian camp where he worked as a guard.
What sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victims clawed up in torture servant".
That Jolies film actually begins before the war - so much is certain.
According to Jolie, the pressure on them is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: By putting the script, as so many before, into the net illegally.
Nothing like gone here
On this evening it finally runs again really round for the Irish.
No trace of fraud.
For this the home team dominates too much its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans jolted with joy at cracking loud music, they stomped with their feet.
The Bailey ’ s pub in southern Cork trembles because players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer mugs – and hit them.
"Bierpong" is the bizarre spectacle to win there are 500 Euros winning bonus plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that does not really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a multi-faceted feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerked, jerked her wishful job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home two of Tanners three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are expected to leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
If the forecasts are truthful, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in abundance.
Now there are three out of ten women and men out of thirty without work.
In the Irish Times, there are several letters to readers of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the brook in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, go away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one then makes the light."
The Yuri ’ s student, Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future as the government only wipes its eyes and no longer offers prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20 year-old.
She observes how her fellow students haggle from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known how it feels to build something somewhere else for six months.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29 year old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely, because he makes extra strata in order to be able to pay the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he walks over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cool rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for EUR 380,000 four years ago - 100 percent financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children I have to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he currently hears.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps this makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look how it is going with life somewhere else.
He already has a few years of work in London and why shouldn ’ t he and his girlfriend run well in New Zealand?
But there is still one thing that worries him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He fears that it could turn into a living party.
"Not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's rather call it a sidewalk party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil ’ s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, indicating the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of advocates for democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since last year ’ s sharp collapse, such a trend can be seen.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region ’ s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country ’ s democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America ’ s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only marginally in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil ’ s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more palpable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the levels have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents above the region stated that the private sector is essential for development, and in 2007 it was 56% (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the USA as the most influential country, with Venezuela assuming this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Ein Wahlschlappe
Nobody had expected the elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who hurried to help the troubled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, roamed around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be lifted due to alleged fraud.
There were partly violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN's mission to Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "as serious as they may be, these irregularities do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, supposedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap player Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no agreement with the voters, declares that he is the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organisation.
Shortly before the election began, approx. 250,000 ID cards needed for election were not yet distributed.
Much is at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina ’ s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed up her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. That ’ s the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to re-elect next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife ’ s election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner ’ s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (at which one parliamentarian hit another in the face and others accuse the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," the President said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at its own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
Official inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and labor demands - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main objectives, not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Population Census INDEC, which subsequently beautified official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It called for talks between the private sector and trade union leaders.
According to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina ’ s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps, for this reason, Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with holders of securities who had rejected the country ’ s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in drawing up a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of symptoms that they received will be flattened.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly and quietly cancel her husband ’ s many political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan ’ s voters are slowly approaching closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those entitled to vote, rose to elect mayors and councillors in the five municipal districts, which is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Yingjeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China ’ s mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only a few.
Although his Kuomintang Left Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan ’ s greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party ’ s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flags of swinging mass relocations and only sparsely clothed dancers occurred.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempt to murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man shot him from the crowd in his face. Lien was wounded and a surrounding spectator was killed.
Bizarreerweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing ‑ wen, the leader of the DPP, has impaired the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been addressed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China ’ s military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided fomenting the anti-Palestinian Chinese feelings too much.
It reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan ’ s economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, Ma wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui Netanyahu sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he strongly advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai ’ s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed, and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
As the DPP ’ s presidential candidate, Tsai received great approval, such as Su Tseng and Chen.
Her party is doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes discussions without prejudice.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a “trustworthy alternative ” to Mas ’ s early approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan ’ s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidature.
Even without Chen ’ s interference, the DPP is struggling to elect its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of re-approach only in a limited way.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
When you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Surprisingly, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year ’ s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have published at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good sense for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spalding.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favourite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Among the Iyers competitors are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboard player John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-legged favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which otherwise albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big group category. He thus takes up the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life's Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead into the classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daughert's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A. based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughert's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category Bergs "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses" Marc Antonio e Cleopatra "von Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's" L'Amour de Loin "vom Deutschen Symphonie -Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins" The Enchanted Wanderer "vom Orchester und Chor des Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans" Ivanhoe "vom BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt ’ s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded in the Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa and Pekka Salonen.
This 30 minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky ’ s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classical Crossover the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously promised by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, this makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are only very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 6: 00 p.m. and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes distributed fairly evenly on both sides according to Press.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," was a comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand."
"America is in the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Artificial resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species, which can live among other things by arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' form of life," said Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and Co-author of the report, which will be published in the online journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium in Mono Lake in California continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, since scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements', which are in our opinion absolutely vital, are not necessarily specified", said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe and Simon from NASA ’ s Astrobiological Institute, who conducted the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, they assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has not been a working example yet.
Arsen was more common in the early earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently from the early age of the Earth," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe Netanyahu's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
According to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs, the remaining two of the four exhibitions, which were stolen in front of a Bellflower Motel, were found on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express and Van Stahlen, where the animals were accommodated in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, explains.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more," explains Whitmore.
"We follow some traces."
The dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 year old male, and Didi, a 10 months old female - were unhurt according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba.
South California is a stop on the nearly one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00 a.m.
Peek promised a finder wage to anyone who could give an indication of the corgis. Microchips were implanted to the animals for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder ’ s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the “Preparing ” faithful plan to cancel the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat slimmed studio as general manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM Productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself contributes $75 million, is leading the company. Financing is expected to be by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management that fought with interest payments of $300 million / year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper ’ s efforts to resolve MGM ’ s financial concerns and pay out more than 140 of the studio ’ s faithful lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which have already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for managing the company, will receive a "Success Bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and produced an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released at the beginning of 2012.
In addition, they are planning two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which will be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift balance
This year ’ s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gadgets can tear a sizable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX round wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect round game corresponds to about 10 classic skipping ropes or about 48 cans of Play and Doh.
But you can save your gift ebudget.
Recently I visited three national toy dealers in search of three electronic toys under $80 - a whale of Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
It immediately became clear to me that Moore ’ s law had entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most well-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells are coming into the market and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing -a -ma -jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several Sing's are singing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the dance star Mickey (Fisher's Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
The animatronic doll offers alternating games based on the Elmo Live Technology developed last year, as' Simon says', and thanks to the new hinges with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon's Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better wizard with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not like to entrust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty and keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog ’ s first major revision of the Leapster range.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher's iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD's card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8), the five blocks are not larger than a match box and have their own LED display.
The game is about merging the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised character competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to toy shops alone according to the offer, weaving and club penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be roller skates or a puffle.
The latest head cells are powered micro robots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It is fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he holds out some things.
We fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become softer
Like an apprenticeship officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checking his nervous subordinates, and issuing orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination to violence - to impress viewers.
"Just standing!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely grown out of the teenager's age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood firm.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair with blue and white striped bows.
"For me they look average", Mr. Tang remarks disparagingly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China ’ s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the greyish green.
Wuhan in Central China substituted violence by staring down: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly set up snack car and stared at the operator until he grabbed and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a municipality in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police strips. They have been chosen for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
The critics are right.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws through fines or other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media routinely show another image.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his mobile phone as they threw down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traders.
“Chengguan frightens the government, ” the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job advertisements, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figures and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above-average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too strenuous.
"The most important is their image," said an unnamed district official at the quasi-governmental Rednet.com website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district administration, does not agree with this description,
admitted, however, that in China size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or humpbacks here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple baking and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that such great importance is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, the 21 year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the brief attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply scaring traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please disappear here."
"We have already told you so often!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily let down his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the civil servants, the activity is rather monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20 who is studying distribution in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is designed to protect them from public hostilities that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after the rumour that Chengguan Officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan Officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered in a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired contrary to the rules on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation the officials paved the way with a grim face to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we proceed verbally."
"Sometimes also physically," explains Mr. Li sober.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
Prosecutor will not sue Senator Ensign
Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the Senator ’ s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican. Until the scandal that caused headlines across the country and dampened his career, he was considered a Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign ’ s office announced, he was "delighted" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
The Senate Ethics Committee could, however, impose a discursive penalty.
According to Ensign ’ s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been closed and that there were no further charges on this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first revealed in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election helpers, helped to make lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affaire with Hampton ’ s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during an election campaign called Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton ’ s lobbying for them after setting up.
Since Hampton was in Ensign ’ s election team recently, he was not allowed to lobby his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called prohibition of the revolving door.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an agreement and an infringement of the revolving door of the statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients who are in the government's sights.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said the ministry seemed very cautious in accepting political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including last year ’ s decision to drop the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organization whose objective is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day when he was told that the ministry would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign ’ s defenders had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had acted "in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had put to the prosecutors.
"I am not sure to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only that much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign ’ s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Elections Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported Senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
A December 2008 e-mail confirms that, after Mr. Hampton ’ s lobbyist, Mr. Ensing ’ s chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Interior Ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also arranged lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had hired for lobbying.
When, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in Republican rankings.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire ’ s appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the riots in the courtroom.
They sent their reports of gruesome testimonies via Twitter every minute.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter announcements about the trial of rape and children chained to beds in a house that arose in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye ’ s attorneys have already submitted applications to court to explain the reasons for an appeal and will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of stirring details, so that the jury has been inappropriately influenced by public indignation.
This objection could lead the Court of Appeal to consider whether new technologies would require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced it during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender.
Last week, the president of the Supreme Court, Jon C. Blue, briefly rejected the applications by decision when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no proof that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about a trial ’ s fairness.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court annulled the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the television series and the feature film "Auf der Flucht" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals, which consider Mr. Haye ’ s conviction half a century later, may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard ’ s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some application courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes ’ lawyers explain to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scenes during the selection of judges.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke's Petit, 48 years old, and her bag, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror that had been a critic of the prosecutor ’ s office, and that he had inadmissible way of putting pressure on the verdict when he had taken the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of extensive reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a contest of judgments that they submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily rush of media beeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more inflammatory than reports that were more slowly refunded was a hostile technical view that impoverished reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts were often confronted with the argument that societal and technical changes required adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the 1966 Supreme Court in which Dr. Sheppard ’ s conviction was lifted on the basis of reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the dividing?
After a campaign of insults and negativity this week, little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the heads of Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were made.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party score collection.
The public meeting of the President's EDP on Wednesday was likewise civilised, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months gives rise to mutual respect, obscuring the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other calls for a spirit of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after another party warfare.
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, Washington ’ s November election voted mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die again.
And that's good. "
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush ’ s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see many things happening from today to 2012, as a prematch, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the emergence of the new Republican majority in the White House, and with the tea parties that served voters whose education.
No matter how worried Republican leaders may be that they poker too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Excessive Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even closer to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise in financial matters, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes, and health care, later followed by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Particularity and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990 ’ s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress of Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a much more far-reaching 2012 election.
From this point of view, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate them from each other.
Embroidered US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service blackmail high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority" - takes its part from the money that the leaders move upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow ’ s mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that had been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it" disturbed "and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," said the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Last, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report also says that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay, find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another bias.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in an interview recently.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, India estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks number 154 in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow ’ s late end, will certainly provoke displeasure within the Russian government, though, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow ’ s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks ’ documents could be a forgery, and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to be done with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built him, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge domination known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book, which for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia joint tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, aggravating their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia ’ s society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the pole pot Ied government collapsed, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread restlessness here until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country ’ s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overrun government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice builder.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodian documentation centre officials that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers probably died.
On a hot evening Im Chaem came back from working on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court invite her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, even though experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer period means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that everything can understand."
The center created the first government approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city ’ s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path covered with bushes and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tyre pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone saleswoman at the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she will drop a bush of mature bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect any more weapons capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama ’ s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons capable uranium from a Belarusian research institution.
That prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama ’ s April Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama ’ s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"That's our raw material... We won't make any dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago, when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly radiated, say Official.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say Official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officers.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Continuing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons capable uranium this year, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Under the common agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko ’ s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday ’ s statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA ’ s flights to Guantánamo with Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees via Spanish territory, according to a telegram issued by the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents that Wikileaks covered and forwarded to the newspaper "El País" (via cable), adding that the former deputy head of government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing aid to practices of contempt for human rights in a Duzend country, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the report of the Council "had hit Zapatero in the offside" and said that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", so as not to be "unprepared surprised", Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González, in turn, told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish intelligence centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence via the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discrete governance," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are extremely concerned about their independence and would do what they consider appropriate," he gave his staff instructions to avoid "inflated rhetorical comments to let the tension run away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the way in which the PP proceeded in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, capital will strike, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he points out.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "hardship" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this epithet, which she leads from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
In order to understand them, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of its family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman established a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She held a year.
Shortly after dissolving her relationship, she became aware that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and leave what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she speaks of her return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to imagine a job if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him again with someone except with my mother", a dubious intention, if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.

Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking to the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while that figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend – the result of redirecting the PSC ’ s share of votes and binding the PP ’ s electorate – should persist, the PP ’ s analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and lose at least 9 deputies (25) in the PSC.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its Member or gain one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next appointment with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Again, the People ’ s Party (PP) can be the tongue of the scales to put an end to socialist supremacy in four provincial capitals and with their majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People ’ s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not achieve a majority or fall back on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona ’ s upswing, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People ’ s Party has also seen a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell cared for Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona police force formed the Thailand controlled jihadist cell, which provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e Trudeau Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaida has been "weakened" worldwide and "thus their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups comprising the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could unpunished cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police forces have also participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that in the area of the EU in the next few days there will be similar attacks as the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - stole especially tourists passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative circles underlined that until now no links could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e Trudeau Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the Catalan assassination attempt, several thousand dollars had been dispatched by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which brought an end to the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez and Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with their terms of support for his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already placed during the election campaign and can be summed up by the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People ’ s Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she won last Sunday – a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois regional party CiU depends on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the next parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the Party Chair of the PPC is concerned, it calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia", as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - to be postponed and even subject to a referendum by the leader of CiU.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to streamline the built up political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations to take office at Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the retirement home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The people responsible for the care of the elderly La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they pointed out what damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the carer who had killed at least eleven elderly people during his work, for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, went to court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse those responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our liability obligation force us to accept the trial and the civil liability".
The institution must accept not only a loss of social reputation, because it did not establish the criminal acts of the custodian in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he assumed that no physician had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities because of their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point completely and explained that "missing measures could have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the case of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The already baptized as "angel of death", the day before yesterday, committed eleven murders and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of the staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila was lying and indeed chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from within by giving them bleaching lye, as he had done in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October, according to confession.
In La Caritat one does not believe the statements of the custodian, not even as regards the number of committed murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say that they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (ECB) threats
Investors yesterday responded sharply to the ECB ’ s threat to President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond. ”
The Euro peripheral countries ’ risk premiums have risen dramatically and European banks ’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has hardly increased in points which cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which is recovering to the extent that it collapses, however due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not yet lose his fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which require the ECB to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of indefinite access should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be "extended at least until March" and quarterly tenders to be maintained with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to purchase bonds and to give a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday ’ s markets will be thrown back, and if we persist in withdrawing our liquidity measures, God alone can help us!
As at the ECB ’ s May session, when the Bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt, and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year national titles in Portugal was rather weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared with 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perception, Trichet said.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt deletion of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The total is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possible another 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the rescue plan figures are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary support for its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland will continue to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven ’ s ninth symphony.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficits, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi ’ s Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect. Therefore, we are counting on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need; the treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March; interest rates are very expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only being counts, but also appearances."
Only courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Owls challenges Vega Sicilia ’ s meeting of shareholders
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the societies Owls and El Enebro, does not end.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurff, will challenge the shareholders ’ meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on 16 at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group.
The founder of El Enebro ’ s largest holding of corporate services does not seem willing to surrender in his dispute over the control of El Enebro ’ s institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The General Assembly of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has launched a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The appeal of the judge to appoint the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the General Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicant - his five children - to recognize the annulled assembly of 18 January by means of legal excellence, fraud and abuse of rights", as official spokesmen declare.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, wrapped in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on a judicial path.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background to the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the action for appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
In the beginning nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons, in the final sprint last November everyone sat on the victory of Fernando Alonso ’ s Ferrari.
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer science program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial department, explains that using this software in the Red Bull Formula 1 factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bulls Team. They carry out analyses and all sorts of changes to the race car with powerful IT systems.
The Siemens Manager said that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which only Renault is responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - particularly by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two drivers, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull ’ s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Other protagonists hide behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the race tracks, whose support is invaluable and whose recognition is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, emphasizes that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in R & D contributed to the victory for racing cars with 50 percent and that the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by IT because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty stores with local distributors in two years
Yesterday in Barcelona, Hewlett's Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a shop is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and then, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP's devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large enterprises already have their service contracts for technical customer service", explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants its rival to 'steal' a million customers in three years
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Trudeau, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a slump in interest rates that banks are trying to compensate for with increases in charges and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject still to be established.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose - which is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011 Business Plan 2013 is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the Bank will be presented together with the Annual Report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all banks ’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will conclude its Optima Guidance Plan four years ago this year, which was initially designed for three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfasts organized by the APIE, Netanyahu stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
It would also be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years' time - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will ablute, the risk surcharges, which banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity, are already passed on to the price of loans as compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We did not turn off the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted ∑.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that banks are currently pursuing the category of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell ’ s guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change next year," he says.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "rising enormously" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capital increases.
After asserting that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of markets, he defuses the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be circulated, but, unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions, thereby intercepting the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The CEO of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that the savings banks could merge and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first phase. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of the things have been completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA) Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17, each with 75 500 million, is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have met the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of undisputed opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed unseriousness and ignorance", because "Banco de España urges us to conclude before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process, which will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has put forward new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
Let us anticipate that Merkel ’ s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reorganisation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possible suspension of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits, and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent it from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully ousted the decision to save Greece.
That was strongly criticised at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out anew with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union ’ s agreements to enable a country to be saved while, at the same time, obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it boosted the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to pay part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as Spain has cited in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not just a question of cutting the government deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will turn into more calm.
And that we will make use of the opportunities offered by us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in one ’ s own house has paved the way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like this would change.
Among the possibilities envisaged, we should not exclude the fact that we have to leave the euro area, which is full of little reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and control bypass
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The elimination in the match of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League, allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), led to a lot of ink being spilled over whether it was an unsporting action or not and whether both players might be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the mandatory penalty on the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, UEFA ’ s disciplinary committee punished the coach of the club, José Moreover, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport obeyed rules.
Part of the debate about the case depicted is based on the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem pretends nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and on the dramatization of the club, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to bypass its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the spirit of the sport should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the infringing players draw an unjustified benefit from the opposite.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by mismatch or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a sanction, but should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and joyfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringer drew from the intentional fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival was neither brought into an unfavourable position nor were advantages for the played game required, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it ’ s a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree of ignorance, as the team could eventually leave. Furthermore, players get a sanction with this approach and pass into the second cycle of cards, in which they excrete less than in the first cycle due to a card accumulation.
So it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision to evade or flee without punishment.
Although the border between invention and regulatory environment has been blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked transmission of rules.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer reception for groups Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar makes this year an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December fall.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which provide Barcelona ’ s restaurant and leisure industry with oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to also capture the customer segment, which represents the big mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year ’ s Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top warehouses (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are required, confirms Gaietà Farràs, Chairman of the Barcelona Catering Board.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they book."
"They like to go out, but they pay great attention to prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those "offering quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers will save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in several centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 bars, optimism is not lost, as revenues have been blooming again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business, although focused on a few days.
Sources of the group of companies underline that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
Among the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price shit. It gives the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green rungs sprout, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are again in upswing.
From the Fecasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), Enric Gomà, vice-president, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively", although the customers "strike out a maximum".
But the fun of celebrating did not decrease, no matter who pays.
Pakistan ’ s nuclear programme raises major concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileak revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
In the margins of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not intensified, but on the contrary "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that weapons are not composed, but are stored in their individual parts to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - Washington is preparing sleepless nights.
The Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists the following risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US alone, but also by Russia as excessive, and as grounds for caution.
"Pakistan must employ tightly believing staff to guard nuclear installations; because of the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to disclose people participating in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian State Department at a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assang ’ s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is slowing in nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the South Asia State Intelligence Service, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify" to the person in charge that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support for terrorist groups during a visit by the Supreme Leader, General Ashfaq Kayani."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a senior leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red warning to persecute and locate ∑.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian ∑, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "find and persecution" from ∑.
However, this is not a traditional order of arrest.
It is also not new, it dates back to 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "assured the police that they knew where and how to get in touch with Mr ∑."
Already on the 20th the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the authority.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find ∑, "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, which is likely to be there.
The action outraged Assanges lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that ∑ applied for departure from Sweden and was given the permit by the prosecutor, who is compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin ’ s chief of security.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is indicted in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother claims her son's innocence from Australia - ∑ is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an indefinite location. During the conversation, he applied for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should place emphasis on the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior person in charge of the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama ’ s spokesman to pay less attention is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further and he had to revoke his statement that ∑ had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that let information leak through the government, he is guilty of treason, and everything that is not an execution is too mild a punishment," he told the channel Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the nearest Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of ERC after the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the close ties of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod and Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is weakened today as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could speak secretly about remaining in office.
With ballots, not with raised hands.
If the carodists wanted to miss a fine to the presidents, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he reaffirmed that he would not feel confirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The nearest Carod demands more from the President than just to make his office available to the Party. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the Congress.
But, because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree a plan of action with the Board of Directors from now until May.
For this they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee for Puigcercós. In return, the latter is to promise to transfer the Congress to autumn 2011, which the party leaders already consider to be a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is a pity of stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the proprietor of Innovació considered it a fact that the leader of the party was "supported in exchange for various objectives".
He counted five, two of them in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of assembly as functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who already fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
Indeed, at the 2008 bustling assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the Plenary Assembly Principle at a Congress to deal with the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle the internal restlessness of the last years the approach of this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time could have come to take up this matter again and complete it forever.

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China ’ s representative said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45% of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, insures Su Wei, the country ’ s representative at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He said that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the targets for energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also said that some multi-annual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and which has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
A provincial project on climate change is also under way, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a government advisor on climate change in that country, confirmed that China ’ s efforts were far greater than was commonly assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to pollution.
Likewise, it is making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years, and another step by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former president of the panist party had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right to do him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right would do him.
In an interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo, Governor of the State, he said that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not frightened by internal competition; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly elect the or the best Chair in need of Acción Nacional for the next three years, which is why he would "hand over the Stafette to the one that the Council would decide."
"I am quite unconcerned and open. I would be proud to entrust the office of party leader to each of the five."
He predicted that the party ’ s recovery in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although “it is not time to think about 2012. ”
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would wear the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of requirements."
When asked about the PRI ’ s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them if they finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the proprietor of the Federal Government has expressions such as those that he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no ban on the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama stands up in Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the president of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law for the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of adopting the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama yelled.
Its short communication contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document, which calls on the public to enter into contact with its senators without delay, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the Bush era and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START - Agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the race," he said.
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students can be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, who have lived in that country for the last five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of advocates of this project organize an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Place your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The lust for the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but hints for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the walk, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and closes, that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'praise of the invention', in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a U-turn and reported about America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack his own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the false witness who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lie are approaching each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in the series, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the film to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertorian woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting her country - as throughout Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained, having stressed that literature is communication and binding, which build up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "raised this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noticed that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness run out of dogma, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no, and behind each denial there is a small yes."
"In order to possess our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger in the wound and harming those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing those who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinean has played with the medal to the second champion, he has left a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive final games with the same team.
The antique strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4 and 2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3 and 1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out undecided after 210 minutes of play, but with the penalty he came forward with 3 -1 and got two possibilities to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4 -3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued again from misfortune and free himself from the evil spell, in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when asked about the lost final games.
The last final has remained strong in his memory, he assures that he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we on the line are prepared, the players also, because the last time we were prepared with two elf meters already to leave, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootings does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title already in our hands, that left us something for this final, and we hope that this time will not come."
It is in Romanso's power to be not only second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Before they talk to the consulate, people must present themselves to the visa application services; costs will be shortened.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC takes up the biometric data of the applicant, which are checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new method has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk to the consulate, they only have to imagine the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation will have less time there than before.
Those who apply for a visa to the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference held at NASA headquarters in Washington, Washington, by astrobiologists, a science investigating the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured them that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for alien life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there can be human-like creatures in hostile environments, which until now have been thought to be uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that they could be transformed into intelligent beings, such as humans, if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite's National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that is considered too toxic for all imaginable forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, chances increase that there might be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from that known to us."
The space agency announces tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual range of its findings.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest moon) under the question of whether his chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organic Law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The sixtieth parliamentary term had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent one, was already installing itself.
Before the introductory session of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organic Law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number of parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Presidium, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo said that with these reforms the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political peripheral position.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming that political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point I (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that there should be an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five deputies and they talk to other colleagues to make them become more," said the Convergencia.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT stated in reference to PAN and PRI that the congress has now turned into a 'prey' for two.
"Before, it was only one party, now they divide it into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested that MEPs be respected and given their place in the negotiating tables.
The five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform.
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another cheque for more than 200 000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration this cheque was issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already foretold that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of cheques still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by ASE to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the inspection of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers on July 25, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam where they collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places must be improved penetrating
Tourism companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the fall of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in a bad condition and that have a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Association of Traders of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions it was requested to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and walkways had a negative effect, because the tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians do not know what it means to close a company one day and they do not think about how much money you lose, otherwise they would not carry out the construction work slowly and without plan."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had brought attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance by the city.
"The community has to take on its responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How should it do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we inhabitants also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that look uncultivated and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in motion," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these arrangements, and these kinds of incidents merely represent what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought together with the city on front man. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive for tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, facing many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, facing many challenges.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival discussions between the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and above all work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the hotel association Tres Islas, says that one of the great challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to allocate the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources. It is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Money must be allocated to tourist projects, public safety must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous parliamentary periods, must be updated.
Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela desire.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfil these wishes the next day, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes hard times are announced, because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the brushes to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time already and for his eight months old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in the size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive, 'Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14 year old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will be subjected to various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where places that were supposed to have served predominantly the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis and Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke justice building hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, its possession for sales purposes, the plotting and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation which took place for over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Hidden immigration could be traced without problems
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, is intended to solve the problem of vessels loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be tamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has tied you to your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus's meeting in front of the assembled deputies.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person arriving from a ship identified as being for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates, as proposed, the Canadian constitution of law and freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow ’ s immigration issue, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party does not stand firm enough against the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against the blind passengers, and that is precisely what we are trying to achieve by passing on another bill, the C ’ 35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks guilt among refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year, "said Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly tell the MEPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada and treating the country as a detainee."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Kennedy's response.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would call a vote to ensure that every MEP who is in the right time declares himself to his constituents.
The new unity finds no unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible creation of a new standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "hat made rabbit" as well as a "handmade solution" at a table end.
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he contented himself to reaffirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this Committee of Inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means of forming a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University of Applied Sciences).
To get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate to investigate corruption and secret arrangements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec could grant the same power to the audit control as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government of Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law of this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has poured out in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide took place in Saint-Lin and Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall poured into several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
As the snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is added to these precipitation, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has resulted in the transgression of some lakes in Sainte and Julienne, Sainte and Marcelline and Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint Calixte a bridge was torn away due to the heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the transgression of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, says security officer Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highland Water Centre issued warnings of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially assigned
The Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his fortuitous speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team had the right to express their own opinions, but certain statements had "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unruly speech, which is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation complained that the amounts mentioned in the programme were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid, misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the programme" Dupont le midi "would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore he was not accused of any reproach towards his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this respect that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had declared that he did not donate aid to Haiti, because he did not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unbridled form of expression.
In all cases, CHOI has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which among other things had to notify its decisions once during the main time period within a period of three days, are small.
A King of Kung and Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact Kung and Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now on the lookout for new challenges for the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting in Algeria 12 years ago with martial arts such as Kung and kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been resident in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare. "
Recently, the one who worked as a security officer, and who worked at UPS, gave his rivals bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the win in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from each category had been invited who had placed among the first four at the last World Cup."
"I brought babe in 2009 in Toronto bronze."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which fist strokes and footsteps are permitted as well as ground discards.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the super penalty tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the likeable Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before he lost in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung."
450 million in contracts without tender
In mutual agreement, Hydro and Québec has granted project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision of Hydro and Québec to give the private sector its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project totalling $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of displacement of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and defuses the competition."
"This means that instead of playing games mapped out in a secret way, they are now performing in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ Member, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this treaty was a mapped game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weaved by encouraging the PQ to be "dishonest" and "lacking hardness."
She said it was "at least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity with regard to its working size.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be in place by 2012.
Nevertheless, the Treaty was awarded without any competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the Quebec consortium model is no longer an exception, even in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec company register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau, for example, works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC and Lavalin, as well as Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Concerning the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that Hydro and Québec have been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has bothered the nose about the fact that the contract on project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will speed up."
"So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this mart and say to yourself: they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reaffirmed.
This agreement, approved to the consortium "Énergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro and Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain and a Sarcelle project Rupert.
According to review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, which companies or their branches, including resource laboratories in particular, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total 449 783 344 $, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec are well known".
Minister Normandeau had indicated that the PQ was equally connected with the companies that "financed" it, before specifying that it was rather their executives.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Green, but wholeheartedly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key actors of sustainable growth, but also has little confidence in the labelled brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
It is a pity, though it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it is teeming with information for the sake of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacy that identifies itself as a brake of its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they advanced the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the quebeans still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that they do not believe the environmental commitment of the companies, nor do they believe the green corporate advertising, as revealed by Sherbrooke University ’ s responsible consumer centre.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the politicians ’ discourse on this issue is taken seriously by just 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being stimulated by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, one third of the Quebecers are suspicious of the performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they had also favoured 61% purchases from merchants in their neighbourhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as a king of recycling who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, requested by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint Laurent, which belongs to Daniel Langlois, in order to return it to its actual cineastic function, apparently do not receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted to engage in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially hoped for, which could create an existential solution to favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources detachable from the state kitchen of rumors.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request for petitions has been revised downwards again.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by François Macerola, President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), to Minister St Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
However, the cabinet's counterproposal was forwarded to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinema owners had opposed direct state investment in support of the take-over of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not provided to other cinemas.
However, several other market players in the segment filed substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the Autorenkino in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinema halls that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele in the bar.
Société Angus and Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are in turn managing a privately financed Campagne, with a total of $700,000 expected to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only a single screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not dismiss the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward corrected proposals that were made to them.
Mystery of Complex Shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic leadership, spread by WikiLeaks, uncover the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time reveal the superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that Canadian voters do not have Canada ’ s relations in mind when they vote, and they believe that President Obama ’ s visit would have helped the conservative government push through its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content that is to be nibbled at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanatory options for this situation.
"A minority-complex inherent to Canadians may cause Canadian, political leaders to talk about everyday internal disputes rather than to push black Peter to the United States in this election (as in 1988 in the Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
“Logically, ” he assesses,“ it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that voters have as a key factor in their turn. ”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government continues to vote for confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade created by a $30-40 billion recovery program," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties' continued existence would affect the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast over CBC are spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "Ninth Fly List", or even abductions for the purposes of CIA muscle protections can be observed.
Another communication reports extensively on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case by case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he said, "he gave the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15 year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The State Secretary has promised to review the file again".
Finally, let us note that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had spoken here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations of the developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs released on earth due to lighting, if the white-annealed bulbs, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission emitters such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFCs emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-annealed bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those brought on the market by Philips this week - this company, incidentally, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-annealed bulb, indicating the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely novel light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also function with a control resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers providing a collection point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not compact fluorescent bulbs, but rather coal-fired power stations that emit much more mercury to generate electricity wasted by the bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars per year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits excited announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Kimoon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election right after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN's Chief Election Officer.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had missed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "proceed with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have been made, and the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo retaliatory camp anticipates the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were obtained by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup which failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo counterparts, however, are now more of the view that the country ’ s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N ’ Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection with the former rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results, be illegal.
The second round of Sunday ’ s presidential elections were held to mark the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for any possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to provisional seasonally adjusted figures published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office.
The unemployed potential in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
According to the IAA, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the third quarter.
For their part, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of people over 50 years of age, 6.6% including the departments overseas.
Only the 25 to 49 year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues with this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments), compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches region of the Rhône region (PS), and he was sent to Luynes prison in Luynes near Aix and Provence as part of an investigation into public and fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini was indicted for embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of general goods, healing, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him instead of disseminating the ghosts of the brain."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of AFP (Agence France Presse) before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, the brother of Mr Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the Department, had placed great emphasis on sending a memoradum of justification to the judge before his hearing with his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than to keep his landfill, which he had to run.
He would never have known the business area or the destination of the funds involved, said Simon.
In this affair Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne agglomeration, was also charged on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then set free under the obligation to keep away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client could provide explanations of the facts that he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has considered not depriving him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "confiscation and embezzlement of public goods by a public service officer", the other because of "complicity in embezzlement of public money".
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people faced by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo and Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affaire of fraudulent machinations from the public sector that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company to have helped to wash money coming from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, here in particular in the disposal branch, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
From nearby sources of investigation it is clear that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "espionage", breathed the French public, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "taking hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary for trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making the idea credible that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss into a bright light.
In reality, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diploma programme, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of Handling Hostages".
François Richier, Elysée's advisor on strategy issues, talked with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to do everything possible to repatriate their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulated loud and clear and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so".
Because "silence does not solve anything", by the attempts at discussion on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a 'common Iranian tactic': 'taking hostages for political blackmail'.
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to come about on August 16, on the day she flees to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it known that Elysée anticipates further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "worsen".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago but is still detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody after a judge ’ s decision in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michele Alliot and Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision", he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, re-establishes it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranians "are currently in the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss ’ s awareness in Iran, the Elysée did not spare its efforts to believe through statements and media organized “attempts to escape ” that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played an“ important ” and “influential mediator role. ”
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities".
The Paris Embassy is asking what so much 'thanksgiving' is based on to Mr Assad.
"Despite their declarations full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to expire with this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria".
A policy launched in 2008 that was "perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserving".
"Building up the Syrian role, Paris is trying to bring to mind" Syria, which can be rewarded by playing a constructive role in the region ".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything".
"But despite everything we thanked them."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot".
No online matches for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
A draft law, which is intended to call on online gaming operators to deny young people under 16 years of age access to these games after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, described by representatives of ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency Agence France Presse, with this draft law.
The games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturers would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also envisaged asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, added the controller.
He will also make free programs available to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018 – 2022: FIFA appoints host country
On Thursday FIFA ’ s Executive Committee appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which fishing for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA ’ s supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win over new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which could only once carry out the World Cup, namely 1966.
The BBC had given it another breeding ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that shames three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who have lobbied intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is looking forward to a new edition of his predecessor Tony Blair ’ s successful move to London in 2005 to organise the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to revalue England's image before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain and Portugal do not lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, raise Russia ’ s chances, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the indiscriminate reference to the accusations of the English press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the Commission.
"They throw them with dirt, they try to compromise them," Putin wept.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, home to FIFA ’ s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of benefits over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA ’ s eagerly awaited approval of the World Cup in 2026 for China, which will make Asian chances lapse to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops by waiting for futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weaknesses of television rights (due to the time shift) acknowledged by European countries, FIFA ’ s sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: disclosure
De Gaulle had really stumbled.
Mitterand had believed that he was using.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show any hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery that adheres to the presidential function is not well to face.
So you have to pretend that there is doubt from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in earnest tone that he would take his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
That he would make the perspective of "two mandates" sound on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP MPs had thus spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have at worst another seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Do not believe that I do not think about the phase afterwards."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him a candidate any more than the day before; but also no less.
If they evoke comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS exhort more at an early stage than was assumed to be fighting.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters would prefer François Fillon ’ s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s (46% against 44%, according to the BVA ’ s L ’ Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," reacted immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were to be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win", corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the ECB Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be finalised at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to bring about the current, more than tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB ’ s active role in resolving Europe ’ s sovereign debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the Central Bank can do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament on the previous day, had not shown himself to be very eloquent about his plans, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of state documents on the secondary market would be 'continued' and that at the meeting on Thursday we would 'see what the decisions are'.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, Treasury bonds were doubled last week by the ECB to around EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to some traders ’ indiscretions, they were said to have bought new Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem ’ s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of pursuing the purchase price is in no way doubted (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB ’ s arsenal, the latter will still make use of the unrestricted reserves of funds in a generous manner, for a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already thinking that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme substantially".
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of obligations to revive the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter at any price the stellers of the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way, in order to prevent the expeditious enthusiasm over the yields paid to the weakest states", testified yesterday an important obligation owner.
For, if interest rates start high, states will be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
Berlusconi's government goes into Italy
After a weekend beginning of concern for Italy, the situation yesterday relaxed a little with the decline of the interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the Regional Chairmen Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the scissors with German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil" and a possible threat of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, disparaging tax revenue that puts the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU ’ s Commission calculates that next year ’ s budget deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil surrounding a new budgetary collective, which could be used for a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says Olli Rehn.
Today, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d. R.), is demanding lower progress in stabilisation than other countries", observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD's Economist.
The question of political inconsistency remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be confronted with a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly detrimental to banking systems," said the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
European countries, which are aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
This is also true of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to bolster eurozone countries ’ backbone in markets ’ crosshairs (see below).
As far as the EU's Stability Funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia-Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first expenditure on the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted to the Reuters agency, the United States supported a possible increase in the Fund mobilized by the IMF ’ s additional direct engagement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front line, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to austerity measures but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other have to avoid having to ask for international assistance at any price, before they have set up their own budget corrective and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, talk about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, first came up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European public debt at the forefront, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be closely examined in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are rising.
Snow and ice: 24 Departements in Alarmstufe Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm level Orange due to the threat of snow and freezing ice.
The regions of yours, yours and Loir, Deux and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers attack the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow ceilings are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente and Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse and Normandy, Ile and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp and Saint-Brieuc axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult according to the traffic police who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency case, and the use of some TER coaches was cancelled the whole day.
In the Picardy the school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris Airport Roissy and 10% from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfalls on Thursday.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
It has been raining billions since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry at Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion are remembered for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has proclaimed a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend to the markets a portion of the financial sum to its double.
After all, the first calculations have taken place today.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning seen through by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, includes the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and taxation of offices in Ile de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is calculated: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
Another is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to transmit this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
One is far from the 4 billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital dotation, which will be raised by the state and will gradually be provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," according to the explanatory statement.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"Since the moment you earn revenue (the two taxes, usually), you can cover the project planning for more than three years and then you can only get out of the 4 billion," is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised will be sought for a long time to come, runs the risk of generating a rather stirring parliamentary debate.
The first public session will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in Sinner ’ s hypocrisy that governs the relationship between states, citizens, and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let us proceed in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits do nothing more than what one could read for months in any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi) anyway, and the frightening caricatured profile of Gaddafi's cabaret artists have long provided stuff for their sketches.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will see that each work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes and Chateau, the Temples or the Rosary Cross) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same is true of secret offices.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy sent to the State Department in Rome, was the same as the one Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of these dossiers made?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the world ’ s most powerful country carries a significant blow to the state department ’ s prestige.
Furthermore, the scandal brings less victims than the "executioners" in distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell ’ s times, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway chosen and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control course ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power remain that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals the public sphere; but revealing in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means depriving them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer provide any reserved information online - this would be equivalent to an outline stuck to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain to hope to be able to keep secret confidential reports on the phone with current technologies.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of state has moved on an aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could private relations be maintained, and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like Science Fiction and Romanesque, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way diligently on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory with them, and furthermore concealing the few written information they have received in the shoe sentence.
The information would be stored in only one copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape for band by rewinding from the back to the front and uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays do not allow anything but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifies its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly dissolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or premature financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has pulled out all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to the fast start financing: detailed procedural report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, leading to the right path towards respecting its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be 'new and additional' to ensure that an additional deployment has been made without compromising public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained and will add 150 million over three years to the funding "Fast Start".
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at official development aid level.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of ODA.
Specifically, the total French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his or her calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 borrowed as equivalent with €1 donated.
Obviously this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission containment based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be considered as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by accepting 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and donating 8.5%) EUR 36.1 million - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are making 100% donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates with a double dizziness in its fast start financing: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once the EU is internally (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely deceiving...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of equitable justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial and currently discussed issue): one does not escape the question of "creditability" or the type of accounting of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is on other issues.
So hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko and Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "creditability" and the use of loans would by nature raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, so this Wednesday of the association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations) published study.
The association, which explains that its results "do not reflect a statistically significant value in view of the small number of analysed samples, but rather represent an illustration of the treated problem", had usually bought the food consumed by a child aged about ten in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been investigated, as have laboratories' sweets in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The disc balance is dwindling: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, this survey shows very well that the reality, in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disruptive factor, is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safely proven as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide severely banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, tuna from the box, even the baguette and chewing gum from pesticides and other chemical substances were sprinkled.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was "richest" with 34 determined chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably underestimated", the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology of Les Verts, in turn, has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation" in view of the urgency of the situation.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
