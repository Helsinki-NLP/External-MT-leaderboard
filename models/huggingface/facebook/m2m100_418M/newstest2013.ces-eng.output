Republican Party Strategy Against Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
Brennan’s center, however, calls such a fraud a myth with the fact that electoral fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after the blast intervention.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. over the past ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, the majority of U.S. governments since 2009 have announced new laws that make the process of election or enrollment in the electoral list difficult.
This phenomenon saw an increase after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, only in 2011, 180 legislative proposals restricting voting rights were submitted in 41 states.
The new electoral law requires voters to submit an identity card with a photo and a document of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for prior elections, denounce the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the elections and remove the right to vote to citizens registered in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required the voters to submit their identity card with a photo.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of India was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend this procedure to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have supported such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit identity cards with photos.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people in the age allowing to vote, do not own any identity card with a photo issued by the government office of their state.
Moreover, about five million new voters did not have such identity cards in 2012.
In addition, getting the required identity card costs often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected mainly by young people, minorities and low-income persons.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required identity card with a photo.
And that’s not all.
Students who are known as voters for their inclination to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their identity card with a photo displayed by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose rather Republican candidates to use the cards exhibited by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship certificate for elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, approximately twelve states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their citizenship.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note that two out of three Hispanians prefer to the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the day of the election.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 resulted in a 17% decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in the other five states have then adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, the African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although the African-American voters in this state were only 13%.
The same was the case with the Spanish.
They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, the white people, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been very strongly opposed to the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several proposals of laws.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Prosecutor General even intervened.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, the laws requiring the submission of a photo identity card have been adopted by only 16 of the 34 countries.
However, the newly introduced rules will make the exercise of the voting right in 2012 completely difficult.
Democratic critics are mainly talking about the predictions of the law and consider it a manifest effort to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the countries where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral body necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is already certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation in the election.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to take an examination or not?
The PSA test brought erroneous results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this further increased the hesitation of men who had already so much refrained to go to the examination at all.
To be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the U.S. showed a high rate of contamination between the individual group tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients who submitted the examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who do not go to the examination have a 30-40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend the examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
The most vulnerable group are men of African-American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are intact.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which has no long-term impact on life, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will rather propose them to perform active surveillance and, in case of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often and more accurately, we set criteria that help in deciding which type to treat and which not.
I recommend that the examination be carried out.
It is important to consult the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise at least to 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer diseases are caused by heredity.
A percentage remains unclear as well.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
“There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
Fertility and obesity, according to SCC, are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, digestive, pancreatic and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends to reduce the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also recommended to avoid cracks for which the same is applied.
Conserving meat by drilling, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet made clear conclusions.
The study of vitamin E is contradictory according to SCC.
Although according to one of them there is a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on how important it is to talk about his fears and precedents from the family with his doctor.
“Getting a test doesn’t mean you’ll have cancer.”
Higgs' boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused legitimate awakening last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And further, it is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by a standard model - our best or "the least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no hundred percent certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle available, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but we still lack all the data to be absolutely sure.
However, let’s assume that it’s the Higgs boson, as the risk of error seems small, and let’s see what’s actually going on.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law that states that two things cannot happen at the same time at the same place.
This rule cannot be overlooked - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also applies a similar law: Paul's excretion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" approximately creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or fermions, who obey Paul's principle.
And at the other end the bosons are moving, underlying anarchists, who don’t value anything at all – definitely not this principle, which means they can calmly be in the same place at the same time.
Furthermore, these bosons are divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the "power particles", which spread great natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow associated.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as it could be thought.
If you read this article, it’s thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or “light particles”, which is the “bearer” of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when the particles with electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they “interrupt” the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the slurry thrown into the waterfall.
From this "interruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) is created and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "powerholders".
More stable field
It’s also with the Higgs boson, just with the difference that it’s necessary to “interrupt” another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much more, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to very high energy values, just like the frozen level of the aquarium, that only a lot of large balvan will eat.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such an enormous part accelerator as a accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with friendly bonds is a circle with a circle of 27 km! - to be possible to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are again suitable for us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on its own on the refrigerator.
And the same way, with the Higgs field, not all particles react: those that do so have a certain matter, while others (such as a photon, let’s look at it) don’t have it.
And Mrs. Novakova asks what all these researches are, what will they bring to us?
From the point of view of science, it is confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to undergo the investigation of any disconformity between observation and predictions of the SM.
In addition, a few physicists literally wish to find them, because the smallest difference could open the space of "new physics" and fix some gap in the model.
It is to be noted that the model has so far enormous shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of space matter ( again ouha!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Reactions
The responses of these research in Mr. and Mrs. Novakovsky’s daily life can only be predicted very hard, but it would be a mistake to believe that it will not be any.
Look: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the Bell laboratory had no idea of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser rays (the previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I have already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine it...
In addition, the application can also come from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although it was not so planned by Boyle at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that one really never knows...
Paliative Care – The Best Way to Get Rid of Life – Le Devoir
Through its Commission for Decent Death, Quebek has recently engaged in a sensitive question about the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue soon, and the draft law is ongoing.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this important area.
The Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question more in detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotions on his bed in the palliative care house of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
“It’s still a shock, you can’t be prepared for this,” he added.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
Resigned, he looks at a delicious breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, speaks with strangers who stop with him, brings him medications, offer a bath.
The courage to normal death.
“My greatest desire is to get rid of that diarrhea, that humiliates me,” he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a remedy for his problem.
“Thro your life, you’re learning that men’s urine stands,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Return to the child’s stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the ability of the person,” whether the return will be accepted, says the psychologist.
According to a number of people engaged in palliative care, the crucial moments take place in the core of such a return.
Patients who go home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their forecast is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear is to die "on an uprising with full consciousness".
But the illness allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good children,” he added.
"I don't have any desire in life anymore," she says, and then she allows us to put her on a respiratory device.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is how palliative care appears, which occurs when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one bed palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we realize that we all die once.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can give him, for example, a brandy douch or pepsi, according to the taste.
Diabetics no longer need to keep their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
They brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later in the night.
This morning, his son will drink beer in honor of the deceased father.
“We’re helping patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of the Care Service.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days go one after the other, but they don’t resemble each other.
In addition to a thirty-nine-year-old man, who is delighted by the last meeting with his family thoroughly grounded on his wings while drinking for his honor, a tragically thirty-six-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two little children, dies after he has tried all the possibilities to survive.
“For six months there are always three to five beds that are intended for people with cancer under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to relieve suffering as soon as the sick reaches the final phase of his life, whether it is at home, in the hospital or in the care house.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal Region, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care provided to oncological patients.
And this substantial lack of medical care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are worried about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto is in circulation signed by top leaders in palliative therapy, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all people have access to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia can be accepted.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on emergency in enormous pain, without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is concerned that patients will not ask for death because they are not given adequate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last few minutes regardless of the negative forecast.
Hélène Richard's hopes for survival were already minimal when she left the challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I’m ending treatment, she replied that she’s regret that I’m ceasing to fight, she tells us.
She told me that it was over!
There is no all-power care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick who wish to die thank their healing doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative pipe team relieved their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care in the Company for Home Palliative Care in the Grand Montréal Region, patients prevent pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which succeed the patient up to the moment of swelling, whether it’s striking or whether the sedatives are given permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, whom we don’t get rid of the pain, will have increasingly the possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t always necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” rather it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
The realization of this reporting was granted to journalists from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public work entrepreneurs, political parties lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unions and the mafia are mixed.
This "sector" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between the years 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has broken down since we’ve taken crucial measures,” ironically says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former police chief in Montreal.
Thanks to this, the 2011 scandal broke out on the basis of a consistent investigation aimed at money fraud in connection with the road construction contracts in Quebec, which then Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct connection between the industry, the untransparent party financing and the corruption of government officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has saved a billion dollars in contracts," when some people have kept their instincts on the ground to gain a share of them!
Charbonneau's committee "has already led to the resignation of two mayor," adds with the hope that it will succeed in "disclosing the misery of some people."
Standing Anti-Corruption Unit Founded in 2011
The Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, founded in 2011, is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the "Marteau's Group" police officers, who since 2009 have secure that the Montreal "cards cartel" significantly relieves the supply of contracts.
In recent weeks, a number of municipal representatives have conducted a series of investigations and accused of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one municipality from the suburb.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving fraud in exchange for public procurement.
Official accusations have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the “system” of public procurement.
During these years, he himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he gained in Montreal to a mafia-related mediator, who then transferred the money to the Union Montreal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was nominated.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were at the time in power.
He also admitted that he had organized illegal funding search for former Liberal Vice-Premier Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with currencies whose prices exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very chile.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him very detailedly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to excursions, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey matches and pocket fees worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with currencies for which he exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector acknowledged that they were allowed to pay remunerations for 30 to 40 percent overestimating invoices through false multiplies.
The mayor’s party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of having without disappointment turned his eyes over the simultaneous budget, which brought the dirty money to his cash.
Based on these disclosures, Tremblay resigned in early November, putting Montreal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal members to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, he has since 2010 been opposed to the sale of the municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to promoters directly in the middle of the flourishing real estate trade.
70% of money in electoral campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says he "treats behind the niches in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promoted by the myrtle to stop the gangrene and catch the guilty."
The process is “doorsome, but positive.”
We are in the cleaning phase of the wound, but it is necessary to establish a own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these doubtful practices cannot be returned.
As if it was cleaned.
Regularly .
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he’s concerned about the roles of “members informed of this lie” unless they’ve gotten into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony adds: "I heard that it's just a weak dirt of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but this does not solve the situation: "Unless the electoral spending are strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer fall down; if we boldly focus on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a more solid basis and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story scattered the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs him to look at his own court.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
In this season, you have set a completely new pace with PSG.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or a completely new dimension of the PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day I go next to them.
The technical team has helped me a lot too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
In the matches it is easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
I am not losing my head.
From my start in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I’ve always moved on individual degrees.
It is a competitive environment created by Carlo Ancelotti.
Strengths from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And that’s why a player like me has a greater desire to play and wants to give the maximum performance.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played on the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
He has no one in the 1st league and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has great experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I had a number of injuries.
The confidence he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took the front position.
We remain in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we went very easily to the eighth final.
What is your goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
We want to be a hard competitor for high-quality teams.
We want to first win our qualification group before Port, so that we can play in revenge for the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget has to...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and enter history.
Today it is not so.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to realize this intention.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league as last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We earned 79 points.
It is usually true that with 79 points you are a clear master.
But another club, Montpellier, had the season even more amazing.
I think it will succeed this year.
Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect from us a lot due to what has been invested here and what players we have.
We fully accept it.
It’s a fact that if we defeat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something we’re dismissing in the newspapers, it’s not just pleasant.
You wonder what people can want more from you.
We can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up the game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have shown that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who didn’t fight to the eight-finals in the second season, and also invested large amounts!
Given the invested amounts, you can expect to have 15 points ahead of the rest!
This is the way you offend the other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not succeed in last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
PSG seems to rely on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It’s good that it’s said that there’s a “dependence on Zlatan.”
That means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he gives a lot of goals.
For this reason he came here and proves that he is the star of the 1st League.
Everywhere he went, he demonstrated that he was a great player, a world star.
We respect both people and players in our team.
He respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is really extraordinary.
This also led others to the fact that they raised their own level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn’t play as I imagined.
But I experienced it and came out of it stronger.
Today, I can play good matches in the team.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since I entered the team.
We learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance an example.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good position in the qualification.
The coach selects rigorously, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don’t want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the remission (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank.
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
In addition, as it is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable but to dollars, euros...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between couples of partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites are already receiving bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it moves at the boundary of about $10 (the price overview is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
In comparison with the world exchange for real money or financial products it is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its virtual finance report released in October.
Bitcoin is referred to as "the most successful virtual money", "concurring the dollar and the euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual money by being a “credit” used for the progress in a video game that a person gets through the game or can buy (and leckdy and back to exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are the depositors of the book of regular accounts, the controller, the issuer of money and the buyer and the seller.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymousness.
The information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in recording this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a file cutting phase; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers will "receive" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they will "scroll" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific footprint (equally zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructiblely connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would result in a change of footprint.
If a user wants to pay twice the same money in order to fraud very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoin.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoin in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided up to a hundred million, so the space for margins here is...
The difficulty of the assigned task also increases with an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the stored bitcoin was stolen.
“The sculpture used does not affect the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of regular accounts and showed that 80% of bitcoin does not run.
In November, a “gigant discount” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaging in converting bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book about this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or uncontact mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It’s just to indicate the address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to the horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin is implemented, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
Furthermore, the ECB in its report predicts a re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghan people to choose their own future and not to expect everything from us.
The greatest damages were people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we also, for we lost 88 killed soldiers, and what all those wounded and crushed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but they are often rural people who deny the presence of foreign armies as in the Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik have joined them.
Now they are experiencing tolerance and frequent support from the local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decrease.
The departure of the French units from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the heights of the mountains planted by the mandles thanks to the French loans, was arranged.
Truck convoy and tank vehicles arrived in Kabul without a helicopter air accompaniment.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty at the time and the land was in blood and fire as a result of the struggles between the various rebel groups.
Their overtaking of control over the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, which were fully controlled by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the present Taliban agree to keep women in subordinate position.
The head officers of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became shoppers, captured state land they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and exploited huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them, in addition, have never been in battle.
According to what I have heard in the campaigns, people desire a government that will not be formed by thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the leakage of capital is significant.
The young people are already tired of war and associated ideology.
During the expulsion in Iran or Pakistan they knew the modern world and its advantages attracted them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul currently lives 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
Schools are full and girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is present.
Will the authorities that stand in its leadership be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militia, which will be outside the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralization according to the pattern of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so there was an abolition of the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s and earlier years, the country has been significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has managed to restore, no ceiling does not work, no essential irrigation system has been repaid.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
The rumors have spread that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And that only lived the feeling that the Western states were here only to empower it.
Without energy for the processing of iron mines or copper on the site and without means for the transport of raw materials through the mountains, however, no mining can be carried out.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak Copper Mine and have given international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the extensive Buddhist campus to preserve the role of the most important employer throughout the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of import and export is dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement implies the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French departments at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative “Getting Your Heart and Soul” has been working for the difficult task of harmonizing assistance and military activities, within which the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) service of “Civil-Army Steps” has been operating, which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved a number of achievements in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural restoration in dozens of mountainous villages thanks to the countless French NGO.
These work, involving a large number of local workers, helped suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the cultivable area.
What remembrance will we leave after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often located at a height above 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, these farmers, according to their words, wish to a small civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and directly touched by them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi is on the next game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily gives it unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
More than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has used a temporary text, which has been repeatedly supplemented, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only further strengthened the division of the country.
From the opposition’s point of view, the president remains in his “autocratic delirium”, continues to “breach his word” and “shake the law”.
His supporters, however, assure that this is a means to resolve the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum is to be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is stumbling by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American newspaper Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this urgently organized vote puts the Egyptian people in front of the ultimatum: "Of you approve my text, or I will leave unlimited powers," which would otherwise end after the new constitution was approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday 85 members of the mentioned Constituent Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
The majority of voters were absent.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitution was announced, they broke the door with the fact that they had no opportunity to express their opinions.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have modeled their step.
In order to resolutions, 11 people from the repairs were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further suspended the fact that one of the few disputes that day turned around... hours of prayer, when some committee members held the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2 remains ultimately consistent with the version of the Constitution of 1971 and stipulates that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
“Pocriticity,” the liberals argue, who see in it only a speech problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular in the matters of the control of the conformity of the laws with the law of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is annoying, because "persons called to expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This is the beginning of the theocracy.”
The worries of the liberals are even more distorted by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current.
"There has not been any specific religious consequences for now.
With this Constitution, Egypt remains a framework citizen state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamists, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," slightly worried Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that “there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, as the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to “fiqh” [Islamic Law Science, note. red.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to make an opinion.”
The text approved yesterday, in addition to religious aspects, is highly criticized because of the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there was a significant limitation to the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
According to the desire of the army representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Moreover, civil proceedings will not be prohibited in military courts, as human rights associations demanded.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal offence of persecution isined and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article is concerned with women’s protection, says Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak in a television speech yesterday evening, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world's puppet and the sea of saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the size of the biblical truths, the modern comfort and the untouched nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons you should visit Israel.
Praying the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that on all those who enter this “bad” the mercy of God will descend.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of water into wine on the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the networks.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
The most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here the believers will go through the Way of Pain or the Cross of Jesus (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial was held, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on the mountain of Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of lubrication and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian puppy of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grown, from which they made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Pride, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 BC.
According to tradition, here people of different religions leave records with wishes, which will then be filled.
Work on a vertical way
The ruins of the Fortress of Masada remained from a secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
The ruin is located on rocks in mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountain climbing can reach it by their own forces.
The rest of this historic mountain will be carried out by a trail.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge flow of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise tourists are transported from the foot of the mountain by a ski bus.
The total length of the mountains is 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, the pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are approximately 300 museums in this country.
In one way, you can’t visit all of them.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Sweets from the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibitions.
It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, his plates are widely represented by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which introduces visitors to several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures of bath users and bath nurses from that time.
In Caesarei, it is worth a visit to the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs shops.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built to remind 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter and you will find yourself in full darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coastline.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, delfinaria and oceanaria.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can be bathed even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and in it people swim throughout the year.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most special sea in the world, located in the lowest continental point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below the sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to submit treatment with the use of salt water - salad, and a medicinal beam that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure the naked nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed a famous sea route that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The citations of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love toulks with narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press yourself to the walls in the street of your sign, happiness will be favoured to you.
In Jaffa you may meet newly married people coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to let themselves be photographed.
And in Caesar - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman Theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the headquarters of Roman prosecutors including Pilate Pont.
The carefully renovated theater is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists in a word
If you are going to Israel, you don’t have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the trip it is better to take the money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now is 1 dollar about 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly by buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper.
It is essentially a subterranean line.
Travelling all kinds of city public transportation costs 6 shekels, which you can ride with the transfer for 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Saturday is celebrated in Israel.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it ceases to work in the markets, shops and public transport.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish-free and meals, which contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from sheep and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cache hummus, various types of sauces, balls of melted cider - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israel.
Therefore, there are a lot of feeded cats that graciously "toul according to their taste".
In the evening, you can see them asleep on the roofs of parked cars.
The passing cats love populated places and with taste put themselves into every kind of goodness.
The car rental will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 a day (Audi A6, Volvo S80) according to the brand.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bicycle will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
expressed numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To know the country and rest came most citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Powerful" announces it to Moscow: Emigrants will save money on the language
While parliamentarians and human rights defenders are still discussing the law on mandatory language exams, the country has already appeared fraudsters who sell "false" certificates
Every year 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On the 1st of December, a law enters into force that obliges every working migrant to pass an exam of knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors over time.
However, the exams will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to persons who successfully achieved the certification and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The test site network will work under the support of the Puškin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can make tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already opened in Russia today.
The initiative was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, the human rights defenders were able to ask in the press many times the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So above all - the representatives of the Migration Service - will allow this to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slavery work."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migratory workers, explains FMS Russia’s Board of Directors in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in immigrants without profession, without education, who don’t know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, the future immigrant is condemned to clashes with unrighteous people, who, under the excuse of helping him, will provide a "post" to terrible, narrow accommodations, in which he and dozens of others, like him, will suffer for months without food and documents and strike for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but after arrival they’ll be deceived, they’ll confiscate their passports, they don’t pay the promised wages,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of the head of the Tádžic Labour Migration Administration.
Don’t guess!
Even less, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go for work to Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but have no experience even with the given work.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather the misfortune: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to obtain at least adequate basic education.
For their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, dressed and equipped to school.
As children reach a productive age, they must work at the first chance.
Without knowledge of language it is difficult - they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don’t have it, they won’t make any exam or get any more official job.
Meanwhile, the majority of immigrant workers live illegally in Russia as before.
“Welcome, or for unauthorized entrance prohibited”
Many of the coming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy at all.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization in addition costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Officials of the Russian police know that we have essentially false documents, without registration, and there are cases of chantage.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists about his experience Tajikistan citizen Umed Chuškadamov.
“Don’t be crazy, buy a painting.”
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
FMS employees have already captured several false certificates of completing the language exam.
Fake documents are printed on ordinary color printers.
Of course, the new owners did not get free of charge: each of the migrants in the hope to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times the amount of completing the official test: that will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers can’t easily buy documents, the government officials and human rights defenders agree.
For now, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed to do the tests for the first time, the time needed to complete the basic course of the Russian language.
Visitors who don’t know Russian are supposed to work in areas where there is no need for active interaction with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into circulation the illegal weapons market
The percentage of criminals using legally held weapons is very low.
The MVD of Russia submits a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to the recent events: the incentives were the cases of shootings at the weddings, which took place without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to prohibit wearing dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which we can obtain a weapons license - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by the way of "tracking scraps".
In the network appeared an open letter, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "absurd striking" of the law.
The percentage of bullying with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes of use of firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior were committed, while in the same period, a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the stricting legislation in the field of civil weapons will not cause the criminal to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can now be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior says the situation with the dissemination of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" weapons market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel in service Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept orders of weapons
The first of them - "armate or military path", i.e. the weapon that was raped during the battles in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baraněc said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces representatives.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of the criminal proceedings bodies.
Illegal "mainly" get to the sale from military warehouses.
Explosions are often occurring in many military warehouses.
“It’s proven that some fires were founded intentionally – to hide the fault,” the former soldier says.
Their contribution, according to the words of Barance, is brought by the manufacturers of weapons.
"At present, private weapons companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market, and are dismantling weapons they supply to the black market including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the “black” market is the smuggling.
In particular, a large number of pistols and automates come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is their production, sometimes weapons are manufactured in small-scale production, and there was a mafia that organized their smooth production,” the former soldier explains.
Where is the weapon?
Experts summarized the approximate proportion of the individual sources of illegal weapons supply to the "black" market.
The report was drawn up in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists collected reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market “by the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons,” the report says.
According to the data that the researchers have available, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was theft of weapons during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have long no one bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers ride for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the battalion, the interested will buy a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order the weapon and he sells it to you through the plot.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two containers," he tells.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore, whenever they begin to burn the plan in the clarification of the crimes, they will make a check-up from illegal weapons traders," the adviser added.
“As in a luxury shop.”
The seller and the buyer often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited the websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Test" platform where there will be a man who would take me to the "cout" where we will act together.
The price I learned there.
Military Reporter Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a weapon, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the seller - the counselor.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich who asked me to fix that my daughter fell tooth."
And now I get there through a person I’m sure of.
He will only give them to me because he knows that I will not give them.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he processed a state for publication on this topic.
The schemes did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photos where it was "all what you thought".
“I felt like in a luxury store,” the soldier remembers.
The buyer, according to the words of the Orange, does not offer rabbits in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential customer, simply don't buy - we go with the seller to the forest and we will put a target on it.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I get convinced that the weapon is shooting well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Furniture on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to the websites and groups on "VKontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
“It’s just to have a fixed amount of money,” they write in the advertising title on the website “Buy a battle pistol or a machine.”
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
Selling to Minors?
“Naturally without a license,” the user asks “Ivan” (the log is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently decided an enormous network of scattered websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can gather with a crack.
People burn like hungry fish on the cave and then capture coal in Siberia.
Military Reporters and Higher Military Dealer Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes:Websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment via the ATM.
“In response to this, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden,” said NGO’s spokesman Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay without weapons and find yourself in prison.

Makarov for $100
When purchasing illegal weapons you will pay according to experts the amount usually from $100 to $900.
According to the words of Dmitry Kislov from the non-governmental organization "Right to weapon" you will buy the pistol Makarov for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is expedited from the warehouses to long-term storage through the warehouses of the medium item.
According to the Official Statistical Office, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousand, and the number of clarified cases of theft and theft of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive equipment decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. fast food and supermarket workers strike
Up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers will work on the McDonald’s cash store.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in America in Walmart’s hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is judged to disappear soon.
The whole campaign is supported by trade unions and a number of leftist social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by the row workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, the objective of the protest organizers is to a creation in them in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is practically intact by the trade union movement.
40 cents a year.
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called Black Friday, when the Orgy of Cheap Sales hit America, captured millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by struggles.
On this day, some Walmart workers, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and leftist activists of multinational trade chain companies whose goods are intended for people of lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from folders through hunting gun and car batteries to dusters, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy from themselves at work.
Availability and product range have made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheap, partly because it pays little to its employees.
They also complain of bad working conditions, such as the lack of automatic wheels or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded salary increases and complained that the company's health insurance costs increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 per hour, but this does not match the amount of expenses, employees say.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion per year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on wages now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protests were held in nine countries and the society should not cause practically any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 a.m. in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its treasures carried out 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
A representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-oriented Huffington Post website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees left jobs, and that the protest was all over a “other media sensation” organized by trade unions.
“Unemployed Treasury!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart shops (those in the aforementioned advanced city are not too popular, and therefore they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn’t even pay you a sick and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with the federal laws and the New York State regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually raise this salary, but only slightly, and on average, their New York staff receive $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower wage in this expensive city.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for such money.
Approximately a quarter of American teenagers who work after school on a part-time and live with their parents will work at McDonald’s.
Few people see their main resource or plan to stay there for a long time.
Currently, I constantly meet in an interview with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live with these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashmakers and chefs in fast-food begin receiving at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded the establishment of trade unions in the field of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration to defend the establishment of trade unions and punish the activists of the trade unions by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely facilitates their lives.
However, introducing a trade union in fast food is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, noise protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the event was a midday gathering at McDonald’s near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, the city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke: “McDonald says it sells billions of portions, and then it doesn’t even pay you a sickness and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!”
The protesters also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must stand together to support fast food workers so that they can a fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
As the New York Times described, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, although not all of them were fast food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a lightning that will burn the flame of the mass movement is unclear yet.
“The brain is able to lie in average.”
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular topic of expanded reality; in recent times it means to perceive the world especially through the grenol of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented the work model of this news and in November it was announced that the patent application was also submitted by Microsoft.
In an interview with Sharam Izadim, the leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft, the company’s scientists find that glasses are a past.
It attracts the perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with empty hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us what your research group is doing?
We deal with the interactions of man with machine, but at the same time we try to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Until now, mankind is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, most often touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without the Kinect sensors, because for all there is a very interesting option of driving using gestures.
What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interaction to a physical level, a lot of interactions still occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a greater amount of data), but the output flow has not yet been separated.
We try to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies including projective.
We need to put the computer world into our physical world, making it more realistic.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add to the real world virtual objects in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - to the joke with those stupid helms of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but is it not exaggerated?
- Certainly it cannot be considered a remedium - a question of privacy arises because we don't always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the facilities in public places we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of moisturized, just of such scary, short.
The gesture would not be captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the brush clock.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, for example gesto + voice.
And how?
How do you ask me, for example, to give you this bottle of lemonade?
You will say it and at the same time show it.
I usually just speak.
It will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
This is not necessary at all, but it is a mutual approximation.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or anything else today?
- Essentially the present generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it’s not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
At the present point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this assigns the work to algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 images per second are honestly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay in a length of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, serial-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me the work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don’t need so many touches, but I need some images per second in addition.
Is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- In the Kinect system, there are now three "cams" used, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflective signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually the usual visible band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A greater number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worsen it because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system for Kinect, to play with the curved location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
"If I remember well, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present publicly its glasses.
Do you not think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in lifted hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest variant would be the "powerful" form of reality extension, when it would be possible on the basis of the clouds platform to switch at any time from glasses to the smartphone, the projection display and further around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in that is their strength (private things you only see), and at the same time weakness - the expanded reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
The hands do not feel anything.
What are the responses your team prepares for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that expanded reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of touch sensations could be a eighth breakthrough.
Until now, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a certain type of substrate for displaying.
Excellent way to record the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays in a defined point where the finger is located, causes a touching feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were fooking on the stomach of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to cheat your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to have to feel at that moment when he sees something?
This is a good idea, we haven’t tried it yet.
Here is another challenge, which will be fighting for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very narrow space to believe that he walks through an open, practically infinite space - we also work on the concept of running trails (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If the brain is becoming a goal, then work is still for many years.
That’s what makes work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers – a lot of things are at the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the "Petrohrad avant-garde" project dedicated to the citizens who are in the leadership, the avant-garde of culture and art.
On the top of the list, the important characters of the painting scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements exceed the city's framework, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all-Russian reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the amazing painter Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a brown man who is all dressed in red, you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in the fashion bars and on the vernisages.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract the crowd of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg narrators, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a remarkable man of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets triggers a smile on the face of citizens, increases the mood of everyone.
Recently, he took the flašinet into his hands and became a Petrograd flašinetist, because in this complex role he mature with his whole bohemic life, philosophy and image.
“Cyrile, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
I chose the red color as a designer that deals with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is only a little different from the grey, awakens aggressiveness and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at setting up a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to discussion.
When did you know you have to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized what my way was.
Then the wave of old, free, informal artists passed, and the new, free types of artists I couldn’t understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazone who brought us to the "Pushkin 10", and other waves were not.
It attracts me to theatre, to clothing, to music, to all genres except to word.
- And all of this came together in your art clinic ...- For me it was important to find myself in the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather together.
In 1995, I occupied a place on Puškinskaya 10, and there before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
There many were born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how the Snura brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Shnur and his friends singed under the cover of a light song, dressed in attached tricks, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programmes of the Hali-Galilee times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, which began his great career, basic education and training he gained from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of the Art Clinic.
There were both our working and permanent guests.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 the survey was held in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "The Artist of the Year" I was named I, this ended my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In these years it’s easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which the actuality and penetration are captured live.
I will have the program exhibition "Russian Museum in the Clowns".
Clowns are an overtime category.
Previously I was social, today being such is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is shut down, tragedy is recorded.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by the way of totalitarian redemption in the Order Order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on the inner man.
Or maybe you can't put his hand and you need to swallow him in the face.
And the lies will be removed by changing clothes.
- We have recently seen you in the role of a city flagship. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
Who would it be if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactical, sweet.
There is a breakdown of culture.
In the past, people gathered together in bullshit, bohemas loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down on microsociety, today it’s very difficult to enjoy everyone.
I am not a banknote to like everyone.
Today you have to think about who you like.
Today, each cultural hero has its 100 fans.
There will be a few thousand spectators on the Stase of Michajlov.
There is a sexual connection, there is a social connection.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land and 10 thousand will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything will go off.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one cheats them and breaks what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such pictures that were hanging on the wall at one collector along with Falk and Larion.
I started with the pictures with which people usually end.
Nowadays, people often mislead concepts.
They say: Culture is spiritual, culture is consumer.
There is no consumer culture, that’s elsewhere.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing paintings.
I am for that culture.
What is a shortage in Peterburg?
Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: an actor through culture.
But not everyone can do anything about culture.
During the time of ordinary tsars, it was not so in everything, the tsars didn’t understand the culture too much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because great experts are needed to properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
The taste is prospering today.
The same Erarta, but it differs by saying honestly that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
What do you think is Peterburg?
- Peterburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
But in our world, art works poorly.
We need a cultural land, but today we have more writers than readers, that’s wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who love to go to exhibitions, concerts.
Such a layer is weak.
We need to make art a fashion matter as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the grant of St. Petersburg.
Born in the Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
The carvans of the cosmic crops with the terrestrians on board go on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of harshness or on a given replacement planet?
I think the choice is not big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says high-level scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at a large height or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space began scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, plants were tested.
The four generations of the grape grown on the orbit are nothing different from their land relatives.
Then the insect was taken to the orbit - a very small fruit mosquito Drosophila.
In 1979, a bull egg was sent to space to check how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.
At the exit we get a completely normal bird.
But then problems begin.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find support, have to stand on his own legs and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don’t find support, the birds chaoticly fall and make the cracks.
After 10 hours there was a complete disappearance of instincts in the newly leaked birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
The problem was that they just died in four days.
"Two times we let the birds go, but then we rejected it, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Syčev's failure to experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flown on the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiment will continue in the spring of 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but will only be the beings of one-sex.
The experiment was conducted with rats who were broadcast into space already pregnant.
They did not find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such trials need to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on Earth, the spacecraft was born.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been achieved.
It is a hard task.
Animals in the loss of the usual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, people can.
Homo sapiens is dominated by abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was Thessaloniki.
The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Tea was flying away and no one on Earth could say if it will survive a flight into space.
Can you give birth to a child after a flight?
“Nobody has yet answered this question,” says Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the missile-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereškov gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child was also the astronaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988 he was born the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
The risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born and growing healthy descendants after many years.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbit flights," said the astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must inevitably seek new ways in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the formation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, astronauts acquire the habits needed to work in the open space.
Water imitates the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in its way a strange environment, for small children it is a natural element.
Little Ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's fetal water and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
“It’s very little for a baby to forget something,” says the newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short, if for a newborn baby the condition is more natural, then for women it is more natural for inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pancreas muscles are very quickly shrinking, the body’s ability to break out the fetus decreases.
This can be left away if the stimulants of the muscle activity during childbirth work.
After all, it is possible that the childbirth takes place in a special room, in which the mother's body will empty the fetus.
“And what next?” asks Valery Poljakov complicated questions.
The baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the Earth's attraction does not affect the body, it will not be able to correctly form the skeleton or muscle system.
The newborn on the orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special dress with the burden in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he unconditionally needs for his development.
"If we go with you to a experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth that will be completely unadapted to the environment here," predicts IBMP's chief bioethics commission RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space is nowadays just a theoretical question.
But once there will come a time when it becomes a reality, and when the terrestrians go out in their roofs on a far planet, which becomes the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Chairman of the NKÚ: The control of the shark system failed due to the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controller and quality legislation in the context of public procurement, but it fails to apply it.
This is what the Vice-President of the Supreme Supervisory Office, Miloslav Kala, said.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct – that’s what I think is missing,” Kala commented on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nečas’s approach to the so-called “shvarcsystem” is mentioned.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not disturb entrepreneurs by his controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law must be somehow set, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister can’t prevent the activity of the Office, which has the duty to go to check and perform its duties,” Kala says.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Representatives you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was specifically?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In a simple way, the European legislation regulates the way to deal with public procurement, followed by the individual national legislation and then the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have been shown to us – in general, legislation may be “stricter and more perfect” with us, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more accurate rules, but it is necessary to address the application of the law itself.
What can this project help you, what does it result in?
It is such a joint control that could contribute to the stop of making efforts to clarify the laws, to reduce and to improve the limits, when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economicity means getting the appropriate thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal action.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we do not necessarily that.
Per that system is filled with such a number of “papers” that those who want to look for holes in that system will get it much easier than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NKÚ or is it set differently?
As for the offices, just like the NKÚ there works the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, only forms a little different way, but in principle both offices act similarly.
The powers are also to a certain extent similar, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these accounting courts at the level of each federal country - in this the system is slightly different from our.
BRH can control only federal money, presented by the state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the provinces and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
What about the legislation here, is that easier than our?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some ways, Germany is referred to as a pattern, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
Is it necessary to have a better controller?
That’s definitely not, but I say again, I don’t like such a comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider as a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise it would not be helpful for them to cooperate with our office, right?
As for the domestic legislation, what does the new law on public procurement mean for your office, are its effects already manifested?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, we do not yet demonstrate in the control actions.
Because we do ex post checks, it is necessary to count on a certain delay.
We only notice this for now in the process of preparing future checks - we launched our new tool "detection of the risks of inefficiency", through which we broke through 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed them - there those changes will obviously manifest because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Do you think that approval of this law is a benefit or a further burden of the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that the rules will be "strict" and it will not be possible to follow them.
Under the functioning of the previous rules, controlled persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a breach of the budgetary discipline.
Is it necessary to strengthen the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal mistake that has no effect on decision making.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
How to get out of that?
Let’s see where the road does not lead.
Recently Mr. Prime Minister said that the ODS will not disturb entrepreneurs by controlling the so-called "shwarksystem" - and what does it mean?
Is it prohibited or permitted?
The law must be somehow established, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the Office, which has the duty to go to control and to execute its duties.
He can say, "We'll change that law and allow it," but he can't say we'll do like nothing.
In the public procurement law there are fairly strict rules on what to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct – that’s what we think is missing.
The roads are cold, but mostly cold.
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowed.
But most of the roads are downward, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovarský kraj
This morning, the roads in the Karlovarsk region were shrinking, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature has fallen between five to ten degrees below zero, but it should be slightly warmed during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
However, on the mountains of Krušných is about 30 centimeters of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to the cloud, according to data from the district road drivers.
The R6 speed roads and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
However, caution is on the site, for example, on some movements, where the surface may be frozen and crazy.
All roads of second and third class, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
But in some sections there are still remains of frozen and places of snow.
Especially in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubic and the Kingdom
On some roads in Eastern Czech Republic there is a danger of flooding, in higher locations and in the mountains there can be a layer of snow on the communications, reports the road and highway directory on its website.
Road drivers warn drivers of a crash, it can form especially in the higher positions of the Pardubic region.
It can be in the surroundings of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemical treatment is carried out on the road I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is on the roads in Krkonoších and Orlických mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Czech Republic, it is most often clear to half clear without rainfall.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree of Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plzeňský kraj
The roads in the Plzeňsk kraji are sad this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
This is cold in the morning, the temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snow and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Drivers have to count on places with a cloud, but the visibility will gradually improve.
This is the result of the information of the district roads.
The D5 highway is almost unlimited, with increased caution, however, recommended by communications managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Plzeňsk and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are wet and also in this case the warning applies to frozen sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Shumava area.
Olomoucký kraj
The snowfall on the road must be counted today by drivers going to the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After a chemical push, she remained on the Red Horse seat and on the way to the Videlsky Cross.
Road drivers were evacuated by snow in the night, and on Shumperska, according to the road administrators, snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the country, the roads are mostly seating without restrictions.
"On Shumperska there are remains of snow in the highest positions.
With the snowfall on the Red Horse seat, drivers must count in the direction of the Autumn," said the chief executive of the Shumpers Road Administration.
Their colleagues at Jesenicka also drove to the ground in the night, the roads to the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment, holy and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are seamless without restrictions, but in Šternbersk, drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads remained wet.
Ustecký kraj, Liberecký kraj
A number of difficult seating sites have been today afternoon by road drivers in the north of Czech Republic.
In addition to a number of places with hit snow or ice is also closed the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku, according to a police database.
Temperatures are kept in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-eastern of the Czech Central Mountain, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been.
The incident is by road drivers, especially from the surrounding area.
According to meteorologists, the weather was ideal for her at night - over the day rain and hiding snow, at night bright and frozen.
On the road I/13 on the border between the Usteck and the Libereck region, the main movements have been to have adverse conditions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the swallowed branches of trees, which, under the snow, flocked up to the road.
Shimon Ornest: In the concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the other alarming news that we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make it a lot of joke and say we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present it closer to the readers?
This is a national charity that we have planned for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before December 20th, from 21 a.m., 3 concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
It will end approximately at the time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came with this idea?
Initially it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our painter Honza Augustus.
In addition to collecting enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about how we will once give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.com people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interprets, also sang the so-called Anthem Against the End of the World, which is called "The End of the World Abolished".
Nowadays, it’s very popular on YouTube, will it also sound on these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and in the complete conclusion, if we all succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
They are performed at all three concerts simultaneously.
The songs will also be connected in a unique direct broadcast on Czech TV.
Words to this song was written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, singing in it also Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We also collaborate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given the fact that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them in these projects.
It turned out that most of them collaborate with us interesting and fun.
What is the profit from the concerts against the end of the world?
On the equipment of the barrierless educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil association Tap in the Jedličkovy Institute.
For students of the Jedličkova Institute regularly attend lecturers and dedicate themselves to activities that entertain and interest them.
Students themselves have no means to go for lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
In the framework of the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future will be created a separate building, to which we will move with this project.
There will be a number of music groups and interpreters at each concert.
According to what did you choose them?
We are trying to create a program that will address all generations including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bártou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will appear.
You will find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar “bomb” action in the future?
In May we will show for the first time in Prague Spring, so here we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the United States, would like to link it to the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizatively?
It’s not as terrible as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, its wheels must travel in the luggage space, further with us, of course, we carry a large amount of cargo and beans with tools.
However, so far it always managed without problems, both CSA and British Airways were greatly prepared for us, I wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to the excursions abroad, you can compare how the individual differences in barrierlessness, public access to disabled people, and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we were witnessing in Russia that in the east everything is still at the very beginning.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual that a man on an electric wheelchair moves himself in the center of the city.
There is no such self-righteousness there, as if you prefer a wheelchair in the lift.
Fortunately, there are civilian associations that are trying to alert people with disabilities.
What do we still need to do with more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we are still behind.
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities would participate actively in social life there, we are, on the contrary, with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respecting the public or freedom is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things begin to really change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular today, but let’s go back a few years ago what made you start it in 1998?
I went as a educator to the Jedličkova Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician, I play, among other things, saxophone, so I and my colleague founded an interest musical ring.
Well, and over time, as our moderator Lada Angelovich says, it was a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only arrived in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on the band’s promotion.
We realized that the work that is not seen is essentially as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to reach it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret.
But that regret is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not any suffering by all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided that they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that if something succeeds to people with disabilities, it’s not a shift only for them, but for the whole society.
Did this success also help by being a strict boss, as many people have marked you?
When we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many matters and require a certain discipline.
I think that is completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the test twice a week, get to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the journey to the concerts, then the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
This is the way it works everywhere, in every group who wants to work and who wants to something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginning in 1998?
Only one Angelovich.
We are an open group, people go and come, this cannot be prevented.
Whoever has will and taste has always the door open to us.
The event will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21:00
Incheba Arena, Brno Flédé and Ostrava Plynojemu will be held in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
All three cities will be connected by telemost in the late evening with the band's "Tap Tap" song "The End of the World Canceled"
The goal of the concert is to gather funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedličkovy Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK.
The entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free entrance tickets in the pre-sales of Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the Council of Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the years participated in a number of the Agency’s projects.
Poland’s journey to space began far earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts were dedicated to the flights to space before World War II; but they did not always encounter understanding.
I will remember, for example, A. Sternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, who on 6 December 1933 presented the ideas from his pioneering work The Entry into Cosmonautika.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for the Entry in Space.
Remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
In 1925, a railroad was built in Poland, which was intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the project is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the missile was to be used to launch the drain or to block it.
The information about this plot is only known from the time press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to occupy with missiles.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegim.
From the materials preserved it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter missile appeared in the professional press, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, and the following year the work of the Rocket - torpedo airzna and Rocketbomba lotnicza was published by the author of Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, the temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was dedicated to all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended the beginning of the war.
Other works dedicated to space science appear in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, which contains four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowitz, it is proposed to create a society that will engage in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already broken down, and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronomical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA has become a regular member.
And the following year, the first Chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the Vice Chairman of the International Astronaut Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish missile to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The 1,800-meter missile was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 a two-step RM-2 missile test was launched in the Bledov Desert.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development had already been able to real scientific work - the RM-34 was to have a reach of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor of the first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of space for scientific devices.
The Meteor-1A was available space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 was developed at the Aeronautical Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The following versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland entered the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second interkosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
The abolition of the law is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Public Works.
The resolution caused a live debate in the public.
It will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with untouched financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in labour price, (intervals) occurs in price tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state in which the manufacturer seeks to stand in competition with the import of cheap goods by “undermining” the competitor’s price in order to draw on himself a greater market share and thus increase his own profits.
In a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or there to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore the responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditure of the state is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation is strengthened by the absolute disappointment of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to replace the economic and social damages that he has committed in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so generally known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unconscious practices of private capital create a situation in each economy where governments of each country are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital their own population, regardless of the social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to the current legislation.
The objective is to economically force the own population to adopt the price dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic force in case of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by a restriction of workers’ rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For many years there have been public food stores for the poor who cannot eat their own work.
The number of these people has already reached millions.
As part of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that well-employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them up to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal has also been revealed in the case of the federal parliament’s assistant staff.
The saving measures in practically all the southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same state where people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline of social level are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the edge of society in the hope that a private investment capital may once come into the country.
But we have to ask ourselves where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European salary.
This applies to Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media in the dark claim that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere with the economy by control interventions.
Then it must be questioned whether private capital does not influence, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer that yes.
The evidence is the existence of practically all-powerful and in all states all-present lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing is criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the state ministries, due to the lack of funds, assign the drafting of laws to private legal companies that are tightly connected to the industry.
These proposals are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type declare, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberally-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as Appiános describes it in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii:" The state has long been in complete dissolution and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For fraud, illegal gaining benefits and with the help of stones or swords.
Submissions and corruption flourished without any obstacles, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."the characterists did not go for the office at all, so once the result of this disruption was the state for eight months without consulat" .."It began to speak of the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to choose an energic man.."Appiános was thinking of Pompeii, but he became Caesar, who changed democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, today’s society is based on a disgraceful preference of its own benefit regardless of the overall social interest.
Private capital is no longer in its essence able to understand and apply the overall social benefit.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
The Cauzality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the impatient liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Under the present state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of a next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites completely ignore in the future possible hundreds of thousands of life losses, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public work is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and intra-European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further lower the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in the benefit of the state.
The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will come from violence and never can” Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refren is “Don’t forget how fragile we are”
"If my sons didn't want war, there would not be any" dies Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, a lot of reactions have arisen, as usual.
Some stand behind Israel, argue his right to self-defense and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue racism of the Israeli state, genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and the State Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who is the guilty in the periodically repeated waves of murder and who is the victim, after all, today’s inhabitants of Israel including autonomous territories have been born into the current political situation and the beginning of violence has not been experienced.
I am about to offer the readers a look behind the curtain, a look at what has been served by the tensions that have lasted for 95 years (compounded from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can look for some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities that completely autonomously managed their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to a pre-defined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it could not occur during the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families is one that could be considered the head of the chobotnice (if someone still stands above them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschield.
Much is not written about them.
of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased in the 1990s to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts in the background of which they stood and which always meant for them a strengthening of power, a multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks in the world and against countries where shares in the central bank don’t have to lead or prepare wars (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq it was 5 countries, after the collapse of Gaddafi only four remained, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschield Central Bank of America, began to issue his own (reasoning government) money during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 in the Theatre.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was murdered in 1963, deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to prosecute the Fed for the trigger of the big economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the Miner of the Supreme, 33th degree dedication by Albert Pik.
The first war had the task of removing the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second had to remove the colonial domination in particular of the United Kingdom and the third had to lead to the reduction of the world’s population somewhere to 0.5 – 1 billion people (this number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and they don’t consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a pre-pole for such a solution) and the final overtaking of absolute power.
The method that a group of wealthiest families led by Rothschields work is to trigger a crisis and subsequently offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED to avoid repeating the crisis as it caused in 1907).
So after they managed to launch the First World War by the assassination of the Habsburg successor of the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsar Russia by the launch of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly, military and economically unfounded, with the capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsar Russia) and thereafter the central European power, Austria of Hungary, was divided.
For the ease of the Second World War, the politicians made a latent conflict situation by imposing enormous war repairs on Germany, creating the presumption of the radicalization of the wicked masses, and then it was only enough for them to emphasize the Germans sufficiently strong, guilty and simple solution offered by the Leader, and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which had to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in the light of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (to return to Sion).
The Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
When the Second World War broke out, whether Hitler was pulled out of the chain on which international bankers held him at first, or everything he did was planned to be difficult to estimate, the suffering of the European Jews in concentrations created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as Germany was committed to the Second World War by war repairs, the declaration of the State of Israel created the foundation of the Third War.
If the international bankers succeed in launching it, the Jewish nation, as in the second, will be the victim in the first line of struggles, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (thinking how sharp people are divided on Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where guilt produces guilt in an infinite chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything was the jealousy of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers encourage people to choose in elections exclusively their own candidates.
Israel’s current Prime Minister Jarab Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers loyal, policy that does everything to launch a war with Iran, which, due to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and due to Iran’s control over the Hormuz Peninsula, which travels 20% of all world oil (the shipping corridor is just 2 miles wide) and to destroy the world economy.
In what light now appears the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a little financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes it a completely controlled being.
“And he will force all the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have on the right hand or on the forehead the cheeks, so that he may not buy or sell who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the numbers of its name.
This must be understood: whoever has reason should count the numbers of that beast.
This number indicates a man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They should be released in exchange for the shaken Mohammad Réz Páhlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, which was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - he could not afford to throw the shaha over the board, because it would thus substantially threaten the confidence of allies in other countries.
The release of the guests in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days after the negotiations were mediated by the Algeria government.
Their defeat at home has triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
Debacle in Iran significantly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled from it.
After complicated peripetics, they ended in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping the extravagant cover story - they went to Canada's passports as members of the film staff, which in the country looked at the locations for filming a sci-fi big film.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by the "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the legend reliable, a film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long hidden, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly conceived political thriller, at the same time called the "caper movie", the story of an outstanding piece, a plot - an example can be the Danny's series of partners.
In the film, the mood changes - on the one hand documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic time photos of events and the way the same situations were shown in the film - big differences in it are not).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, dealt with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then even scenes from the CIA and other institutions – men in clothes discourage the situation at the negotiating tables, at the halls of the office, at the phone...
Ben Affleck has re-started his career.
From the laughed actor he became a respected director and his acting also ceased to be the target of ironic notes.
Argo is his third full-time film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
This is the first Affleck film that doesn’t take place in the director’s home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows him in Arga, where Tehran "play" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when rebuilding real events - the introductory sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when somewhere clearly the history moves.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes of the fictional (fake staff at the Tehran Basar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative story does not actually offer much in the film sense of tensioning scenes.
Very successful with this hardly works, sometimes they think something about the reality - there everything is not so elegantly out (the scene in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport will turn off the phone call in America and the honička after the ranway is quite attracted to the hair).
But the weakness of Arga is the discontinuity arising from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only one in the film.
Affleck's film so a little loses the dramatic move, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciating the realisation and the retro style evoking the thrillers of the 1970s.
It’s hard but hard.
As a reminder of one so far in a certain way of living history, the evidence of how exaggerated the concepts of all-powerful and all-known secret services are enough.
Rules for balloon, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
“It has led us to the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of major European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
For example, the European Court of Justice has recently decided to unify the insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been preferred in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the compulsory mixing of biocomponents into fuel, which is consequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the chicken cage size directive, which has led to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The criticism previously also faced the actual ban on the use of the term butter or the removal of classic lamps from the sale.
Bananas should be 14 cm high.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (the Czech Republic is now also threatened with a veto to promote the demands of its banks).
The lobby’s interests also stood behind the fact that, for example, the banana of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show “anormal curvature.”
The European Commission, however, defended itself by merely harmonizing the unified national standards that complicated trade.
The EU has already weakened the standards on fruits and vegetables, despite the resistance of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the win in the survey may also be the last year’s EU regulation, which requires the obligatory warning of the ballons sold that children under 8 years of age should not be inflated without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to a U.S. research that shows that ballons between toys are the leading cause of children’s death.
Similar restrictions are now applicable to children under the age of 14 when focking in the pudding frk.
Curious ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials itself is rather absurd: anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must instead speak of the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated in the survey, in addition to some of the above absurdities, the EU Regulations on the volume of food reserves on the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed amounts for conserve fungi, which threatened him with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey also attracted the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of granting grants on a request for grant.
However, these ideas arose not in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are disabled by having no sea.
We ask the European Union for a refundation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) in 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was produced at us and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases he had to make full warehouses that he had to export.
For the fact that the Czech Republic had to go to the ports, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidy for granting was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), specifically they were to go to the writing of the subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
Although the regulations are easily targeted by criticism in the Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to improve the functioning and development of the whole Union deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU grants for projects that have no clue to have anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States during budget talks.
The emotions among the Czechs raise the fact that like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific designation of its traditional products, not always succeeding in this match.
The Czechs, though after six years of struggle with the Germans and the Austrians, had the name of Olomouc shapes, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates to the 19th century, had to be named by our manufacturers to the domestic.
The name of rum can only be carried by products made of thin distillate, and not from sugar reef.
In the official list of EU products registered in the company of world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, marcipana from the German Lübeck or parm shunky have already found, for example, Karlovarski suchar, pohorelický and treboňský kapr and žatecký chmel.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of the pardubic pear and mountain pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
How do you think you want a candidate to be president?
I don’t want to be a senator or a president.
If it works without problems in our country, I don’t go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been stolen over the past twenty years, how the thieves are running, the people are increasing taxes and the age of retirement.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’m 40 years old and I’m an independent non-party, I have no other way to influence things than to be a candidate for a senator or a president.
You came to the Senate, but soon you went to the castle.
Do you not turn your back to the people who chose you?
I’ve always said that I’m going to fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected as a senator, I would be elected as a president.
But my goal is not function, function is the tool for me to realize my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation, we swallow in the bar and at the television, but that we swallow everyone who wants to try to change.
The media adds to this that dehonests man and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
I’ve been told that I’m a journalist or that I’ve been a consultant for Jiří Paroubka.
Let’s go to your visions.
In the struggle for the Castle you went out with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the backward asset confessions over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As a president, however, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for the guidance to be a free business, it managed to implement it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal from the left or the right, he will deliberately refuse, and it will retard citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are ranging me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter if a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
I am not concerned about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You’re blasphemy when someone says you’re a populist.
Do you not prove it with what you said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
You are trying to get closer to that.
Someone can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about already work in the world, or they’ve been discussed by prominent experts.
But without the support of the Parliament, you will only have a password.
This is not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you go for people and talk to them, you will succeed in putting up, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our side to pursue it.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem to organize a television live broadcast where I would ask parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality that will name the dirty, it can be pressed on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and vision, I try to look for allies.
I’ve just started politics and I’ll try to get majority support for my program.
I try to move things myself, if it doesn’t work, in six years I’ll finish and return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I’m not doing anything in one person, so I’ve circumvented a number of well-known people, whether they’d not also be a candidate for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who disguised fraud with light heating oils.
I nominated with the fact that people are really dissatisfied, but now I’m on the wings.
60 percent of people did not go to the election and those who went, mostly chose the representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent people in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to pursue.
However, I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct choice of the mayor or hejtman.
Are you thinking about creating your own party?
I didn’t think about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the pure past of each potential party, and I don’t have the money to do it.
I don’t have money even for the presidential campaign, my transparent account is only 20 thousand.
Do you have money?
Are you talking about property confessions, what is yours?
Private assets are estimated at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artworks for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Škoda Superb for a million and then I have a few million on my account.
By the way, Aston Martin I have because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil and dirty.
Are you driving Aston Martin, you have an asset of 60 million and you don’t have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to give your own money to it.
This is not too convincing.
I don’t have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be debt?
I have earned 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that I’m probably not so interested in my program.
I have no obligation to pay for the campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover me what I will receive the senator’s salary.
But I would not survive from it, for example, I could not pay my son an English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I don’t want to go anywhere.
So will you continue to do business so that you can live?
Did you not say that you will stop these activities?
This has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I partially suppressed my activities.
For example, the travel manager will be my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
I also need to live from something.
How much do you as a businessman have been used to take a month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, and that’s what I want to do.
And if I were a president, I would end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday edition.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic. finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says: "But, that house is nice."
I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one is voluntarily entering any of these library in the old style nowadays, right?
Spijkenisse, a residence close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This community with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision came to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron-beton miniatures of fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro bills.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not unfortunate.
And so the city councils realized that there is only one way to become the gentlemen of statistics: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Roterdam architectural atelier MVRDV, the master of crazyly brave column graphs and the maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, took the thing with the usual calm and at the competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under the arms and a stick on the face.
And while the commission was still surprised to look around and crushing his shoulders, the hard Maas put his gifts on himself according to the size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear City Village!"
This is my proposal on the Book Mountains in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was built for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post and several adjacent residential and line-up houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small town shadow, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly municipality, behind which the white facade you would rather expect a milkhouse, is thus richer with a little modern architecture.
First of all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
Long way to the book
The first impression: a reader eldorado under a cheese cover.
By means of the massive mountain, the elevator runs, but the real spatial and reading passion you will discover only when you walk the topography.
From all sides the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor of a burned cabin and the elegant street lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see parks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the rocks with books stand along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly untouchable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We set up the classical space configuration with our feet, and we pulled the space for readers out of the inside.
The interior of the Book Mountains is smartly used: in the center are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home tech center.
A special pleasure are black roofs on books, which are once a wall cover, once a parapet, and once a staircase of stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are strange.
On the unknown building material, even sworn architects and construction engineers are sworn with their heads.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, the project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, on a query to the magazine Standard.
And so we in one fresh farm one day met with a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, millimeter rouno from synthetic matter has been used as the basis under the roots.
It is cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons and then is mature to be thrown into voluminous waste.
For the library, the rouno - for the first time in such a amount - was slated on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By influencing heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colours into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
With 105 stairs you get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figuers in the flowers.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mostly the right moisture of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You't believe it, but this house is a sample project in terms of ecology despite many glass areas," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Book Mountains stand under a glass cover, the sun shines within only a short time, even in sunny days.
The widespread stained wooden bonds, which stand around the glass facade, serve as a shadowing and captures a large portion of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be fully automated.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even describes as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to dedicate one book from his personal fund.
The optical gap was to be filled first in a not fully equipped library, which currently contains 70,000 pieces.
The concept proved.
Police are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with the new house now.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
This is the starting point for identity.
Sabo: “Germans have to play a bigger role”
Germany refused to vote on the adoption of Palestine.
According to the U.S. and Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Berlin refused to vote.
Why ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
However, we do not support the US position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, of course, being too critical to Israel.
During the March 2011 Rebellion in Libya, Germany also refused to vote on the creation of an air-free zone.
At the end, the NATO came.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The reason is that they are just changing their foreign policy, from the policy that was controlled by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re just staying in their role, but they’re on the way to a “normal” foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take, in the case of national interests, also attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by export and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent different from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
First of all, Germany has a large marketplace in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to scare the public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.
This in any case plays a role.
But I don’t want to add to it too much importance, it’s not a completely unilateral relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German considerations.
Did the relations of Germany with the United States harm when Germany refused to vote in the case of both important decisions, for example when voting for Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the United States.
That’s why I don’t think that was as dramatic breakthrough as in the issue of Libya.
Maybe Germany will get some respect.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States has clearly voted for the veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. internal policy.
I think that Obama’s government has probably a great understanding of the European position.
However, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot be held publicly.
I think the differences in opinions really aren’t as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to harmonize its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, it would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently happening.
They cannot, therefore, be part of a wider line and instead have to move things forward from their own position.
This is what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take over a leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relations with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, an anti-German mood will arise.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually a old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European policy is now constantly decreasing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are China
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a label that is fully officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it is protected as long as it is claimed by the real brand owners.
It is not even clear if the rights are in place.
“For foreigners, it’s increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in the breach of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives on my writing table.
A few letters are enough for the counterfeit to sign up their labels.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens an organizer with records of the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company left it to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also parasitizes the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that Chinese are the world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several-storey shops where fake products are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases are different. From the mandate of his mandates, he proceeds against the fact that Chinese companies receive from the brand authority the right to use a label that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on “Bang Dakuan”.
These are women who hunt the wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“It damages the trade, we have to fight it,” Pattloch calls.
“The brand is scattered, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
Financial losses and judicial costs of affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market, with an annual volume of €15 billion.
However, the deletion of doubtful records in the register of brands can be achieved hard and something it costs.
The procedure can extend up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells about cases where the court rejected the lawsuits, because the drawn name became a "market reality" after a long period of duration.
When the prosecutor is unfortunate, he has to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
These are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German beton mixture pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese can still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW. The dispute was resolved, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
According to CTMO, there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little number of employees and space.
But last year it was alleged that “the course of the work process returned from emergency to normal.”
For example, the number of non-processed objection proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, a 75 percent increase compared to the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints to be resolved.
To do something against it is expensive.
As often in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, which is a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is the twentieth in a row leading a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks – there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on fees.
This simply means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Starting against this dispute costs several times, as shows the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
This group has been fighting Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The German authorities have noted that the illegal production of imitated car parts has been cancelled.
However, the counterfeit continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would ignore this because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg did the rights, but the opponent in the dispute is fighting further to the present day.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "Managing is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated.The company’s archive even had to look at a hundred-year-old records to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterpart in vain a "high six-point amount in euros" in order to resolve the dispute.
“You can see what it means for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that’s the case when the imitators assure unprotected labels.
A Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to sign the Freudenberg label for shoes and skin in Germany.
This area of business has long abandoned the group, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
“We need to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Foreigners should rather "all that is worth protecting in any way, register in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg in the last action of its drama with the brand falls down, then it will probably have to pay the counterpart licensing fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Dumping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the body of Imbongi is tested - and in Svazijsk, the orphans are pleased with it after the parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there’s a snorkeling: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, female boats and male mokasins are looking for a touch on the parket and quickly find it.
One, two, three and four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bas, tenor and soprano - are pushing, moming and persecuting each other.
The 29-year-old dirigent Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he connects his voices with his wave wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi body tests a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetic researcher to a houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each coral voice has a different text and even more in a very strange language - Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Assistance to Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Svazijsk there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them go to second grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, the patronate can be taken over.
It guarantees the child a school fee, a school uniform and one warm meal per day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in the language of Zulu “the storyteller” or “the one who praises.”
No one can speak in this space but only sing.
For almost a decade he has been exercising the song in this foreign soft speech and sometimes he also brings it back to where they originally came from: to South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni is located in the northeastern part of the Switzerland Kingdom, depending on the volumes of the German Corps.
40% are infected.
There are approximately 2,000 people living there, some still in simple aluminum or slamed hills. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they have suffered HIV.
In Esitjen is seen in a small, throwing the whole of Switzerland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The cut of the male precoce, which demonstrately reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Switzerland carry the weakened immunity virus in themselves. it is not rare that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the corpus during a joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005.But above all, the members of Imbongi saw a lot of children on the streets that lacked not only parental care, but quite everything: food, clothes, education.
Without a graduate education, there is no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one warm meal per day.
However, a year later, the association "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since been caring for orphans after parents who died from AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mushrooms and sword belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syphilis and cappuccino occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of all five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (flies), cravings and human papillomavirus.
HIV is relatively small among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected people fall into this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other groups of population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
Human papillomavirus is often found among adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people infected with HIV has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
That is about a decade less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in urinating, ejaculation, pain in the abdomen as well as butterflies or scars.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
The risk of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer a hundred percent protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted by the infection from impurities and by the close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in case of frequent intercourse of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patronate, charity gifts, and not least the honoraries that the church will earn by singing all over Germany, some money is gathered.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjen," said association chairman Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can make it.
It also takes care of the orphan children to find shelter, for example, with some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as it is called to the old women in the Zulu language, is the support of the village.
Some of them took up 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they take care of getting the children to school every day in timely uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman paid by the association as well as two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
“Voices for Africa” also founded a shedding school, built two chicken shops, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village were allowed to make a HIV test.
Although the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is absolutely tabu,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it’s quite strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved lifestyle is among other things also guilty of the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also many migrating workers who have spread the virus throughout the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
The culture is different – unprotected contact.”
To promote cultural exchanges at least a little, the Imbongi body travels once every two or three years together across South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, combat, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the black people, which many in the southern end of the black continent know from the times of apartheid.
The bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of the black - such a prize brings not only mood and joy, but also has already drowned tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit the children on whom they have a patronate.
Although this village is hardly found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is more than known.
“Go to Esiteni, there is light,” people say there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is an airline of 8733 kilometers from here, to the duping singers in the test room on the Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light glowes here too.
NASA Discovered Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that in the area of this planet, which is in a permanent shadow, there is a ice cover.
It is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and even 20 meters strong.
This water was coming from comets or asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not give the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the chief scientist working on the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other basic elements of life have entered other areas of the solar system.
Sonds, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved terrestrians, take part in the exploration of the depths of space.
From time to time they send to the Earth images, a small window into endless downs.

Just like Pluto, which rotates around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new conceptual definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink-colored "novorod" on the birth hall of stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The ring is made up of the material that the star has exhausted during the process of dying.

One of the greatest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the faith galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real artworks.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light years away the Trifid nebula in the Stellar constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this star's birthplace into three parts.
Astronomers have photographed the pre-sign of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, the core of two colliding galaxies is wrapped on each other and must inevitably collide.
This star's birth was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who don’t like the technical abbreviation can call it the Southern Wind.
Photo from Hubble's space telescope shows the cutting of the Iris cloud in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1,400 light-years distant cloud consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star cloud there is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The column of the stars gives rise to constantly new increases.
Also this star cloud, associated with the Rosette cloud, is giving birth to ever new young stars. They are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created shortly after the Great Eruption, when there was a majority of hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
It was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 and was used to observe the stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have increased - and the sights they mediate are becoming deeper.
The world's largest telescope for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to see the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, its diameter reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap way of construction: the telescope is secured by a heck in a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope is located in Texas.
Its peculiarity is the high intensification of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching for alien signals in space.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for alien intelligence - can help any computer owner that makes available its computing performance.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There’s a Very Large Telescope – and it makes honor to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror has a full length of 42 meters and is composed of 1000 mirror elements.
The images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Kec's telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered to be the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Kec's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space through the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is a new giant telescope to be created - with a thirty-meter diameter of a mirror.
You can admire it on the picture.
But the most important impressions from space are communicated by Hubble’s space telescope.
The photographs of the distant worlds have been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 – especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candid planets have been discovered since the start of the mission.
The picture documented the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will first be shot into space in 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists have found that there is ice on the southern polar of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger rotates around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to circulate around Mercury, the scientists are now sure.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people live in the biblical age.
There is a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live in the biblical age.
There is a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
Riding through the mountains of Talyš can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus runs along the road with many rounds along densely forested hills, dravy rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the closest south of Azerbaijan. the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talish, which is not much known, in addition to speaking perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and living very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is honoured by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don’t come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road is only one-way.
The legendary wealth, for which the country is due to the oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
But Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have the world's oldest people's festival here next year," Fatulajeva says.
He is the director of the longevity museum, the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Talish from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he still gave birth to a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is Shepherd Shepherd Şirali Muslimov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, Muslim’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. at the age of 136, he said he still had a daughter.
Did Shirali Muslimov not be wrong in his age for a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
“In fact, many old people live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “and in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men.”
However, no scientific evidence of age can be submitted due to the lack of evidence, especially when the matrix is missing.
A glass of solved butter every day
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerika experience the biblical age quite frequently.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why is there so many people living here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the Fatulyev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it consists in nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talish, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of them drink a glass of solved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem just credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzaeva lives.
At the age of 97 he is still relatively young to this geographical width.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butter, which is untouched.
Under one roof there are eight people, among them one of the sons of Mirzaev and the daughter.
Two little children are jumping around.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in typical stomach glasses of "armade".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth make up a perfect series and under the shirt is hidden a long dark blonde copy that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk so they didn’t look like me and kept the color.
“I’ve also never used shampoo,” Mirzaeva says.
Monthly pension is enough.
She always ate what came from her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I have never bought food at a supermarket.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Gejdar Aliyev took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the old woman’s mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the character of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, then he took over his son Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer emergencies.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros).
And maybe the long-established son of Mirzaeva is right: “Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, treated and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The concept of human rights is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations in Cairo revealed the deep disintegration of the country.
The future constitution is based on the law of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president did not save the patos.
We need to make a transition.
“And for that we succeed, I am responsible before people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to the Christian Copts, liberals, illuminated Muslims and secular persons.
Those all, so far hopelessly scattered in the confused opposition, are fearful.
Fear of the “God’s State” in the Nile delivered for grace to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized to say that he temporarily restricted the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded its jurisdiction to "save the revolution."
But what a 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD degree at the American University in Southern California, really wants to save, Egyptians and the world do not know.
Should justice be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the Constituent Assembly with the dominance of Islamists quickly approved in the fifteen-hour night marathon, partially raise concerns.
As in the previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formulation and the legal free space associated with it for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to the Sharia, it is necessary to consult with the Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not, but it may mean that the clerus will exercise the supervision of the legislation, which would bring justice to a fact-release of self-righteousness.
There are a lot of interpretations in the draft constitution.
The problem is that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be preserved.
These courts served for the Mubarak government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship there were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
According to the proposal, the state should also “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.”
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that by using this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In a clear word, this means nothing but censorship.
However, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits deceiving or deceiving the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But it remains unclear what is shame and how it will be prosecuted.
Similarly doubtful is the formulation that it is prohibited "insulting people".
Is it enough in this case already a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of law experts?
The matter of interpretation, like many more in this proposal, which Murshi will submit to sign and according to his words will be “very soon” presented to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
“The revolution has returned.”
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the persile of Islamists.
Thousands of people gathered in an unusual gathering on Friday evening on Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the Constitutional Charter before it began to apply.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdín Sabbahí, who ranked third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution belongs "to the rubbish of history."
Through a short news service, Twitter accused Murshi’s supporters of trying to make a “bucket against democracy.”
“If he proclaims a referendum, we will go to his palace and destroy him,” opposition official Jásir Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not punished yet," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a protest, but with caution not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other shore of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
It was attended by many covered women and salaphist supporters who called, “People demand the law of God.”
They called upon Mursi, “Clean the land!” and they assured, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably trigger a state similar to a civil war.
That Murshi’s supporters obviously did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the proposal of the Constitution expressed their voice and clarity.
It is now time for the people to decide in which direction the country is going.
The majority is in favour of the Islamist proposal.
“The word ‘human rights’ does not happen once”
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, reports Hafiz Abu Saud.
The 48-year-old human rights advocate and the chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing in court.
Not because he would share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
For this he was killed, convicted and imprisoned.
“And in the new constitution now the words ‘human rights’ are not once,” he complained in an interview with ‘Welt am Sonntag’.
Mursi's extension of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandal blame against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president actually repealed it,” Sa’da complains.
Without civil society, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community that follows the struggle of the ideological factions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be out of him.
A demonstrant on Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The Most Smelling Fish in the World?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be associated with the local appetite for extremely fragile fish?
Take a few mature cheese.
Put them in the middle of a lot of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you get the smell of the paralyzing smell of rakfisku, one of the greatest Norwegian delikates.
I am in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and in the air hangs the everywhere odor.
Rakfisk is a salty pstruh boiled in the water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it is dark and it begins to be cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, to say the best, the most subjective meal.
"You dream it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavite," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat small pieces of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk,” Havard says.
Drink can smell.
I will try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish was swallowed into air-resistant vessels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well swallowed, they pulled out and ate - the senses undoubtedly drowned with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Nowadays, the population is rapidly growing – more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, which was even recently much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, unnecessary, although a relatively striking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or sandwich will get you out for 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and it seems that the majority of the population is suitable for it.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here people still mention with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called "the event of July 22".
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway lies behind the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says when serving dishes with a layer rakfisk our sheet Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like the English language of most people here, is completely false.
We don’t like to show up, we don’t like to show up.
Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial collapse threw out the money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the wheels on their pocket tightly stretched.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go on excursions in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And eat rakfisk,” he adds with an uncharged laughter.
I’m standing in the snow on the front for something to eat – I’ve got enough rakfis.
Such a burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening the fish is here again.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most challenging fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast, in which a mother moderator is surrounded by a plate with a rakfisk.
It’s like a Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish there up in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
“This is our pointing, Havarde.”
There is praise and laughter.
A man falls out of the chair, possibly an aquavite.
And maybe the damps of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto has a hard start.
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces, and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is bad at the moment.
In the city, which is stuck even in the best times, steel barriers have been raised closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from getting to parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sherpa and take over the people's leadership.
He faces a challenging task.
Mexico was economically good at the time of Departure Felipe Calderon's office, but the country is in the sphere of a drug war, which is estimated to have killed 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Workshop earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to this goal.
Before treating his hands with the U.S. President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as the governor of his homeland Mexico.
The views of the new leader are different even in his old hometown, the popular and widespread state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo he is remembered in good.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now get to the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the rough and rough roads that were here before.
Plates with his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on the theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring a real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Party of the President Pena Nieta, the Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI).
We hope for interesting and real changes in the field of security and economy that our country so necessarily needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Deputy Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, many things are expected within the party from Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he refuses to express the opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very busy with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great man and, above all, a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the slated streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Stretched under highway arrivals in many reminds the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help cope with the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially burning is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been thrown on the desert places next to a huge waste warehouse.
During the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Nieta say that he failed to deal adequately with the problem of women’s murder in his office.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing the eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for the shattered neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses the cry.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived in her house, it seemed like someone was washing her body,” Mrs. Buendia remembers.
There were signs of strikes on him and a post-death struggle has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was rejected to them.
The state authorities were treating me as if I was an old dwarf, a troubled, and a dwarf.
They want you to simply accept what they say, and be silent.
"But it can't be right when there were so many mistakes and neglect," he says.
The sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by a violent crime and the new president has promised that for his term of office they will be his priority.
“I hope he will be the same president as he was a governor,” said Olvera, a member of the PRI in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of bad treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to deny Bradley Manning's claims regarding brutal treatment in prison.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of brutal treatment with Manning in prison.
He is accused of theft of thousands of documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest secret material leakage in U.S. history, has missed many possibilities to complain about the brutal treatment he allegedly suffered in military detention.
Military Prosecutor May Ashden Fein during a cross-interrogation of Manning's soldier during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that records of weekly visits that Manning had with troops during nine months of detention in Quantic in Virginia, do not show any complaints of misbehavior.
The cross hearing, which took place during the hearing on the proposal of the defence to reject the case conducted against Manning due to brutal treatment at the time of detention, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he was thinking of suicide in detention.
A military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was subsequently published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning passed the forms that officials filled after meeting Manning in the prison in Quantic, where he was held in the regime with increased vigilance from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday for these forms, Manning admitted that he assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints about misbehavior, even though Manning officials directly asked how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about the various issues orally and that the officers who visited him talked to him about these concerns and suggested that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these concerns.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment in January 2011 during a meeting with the committee to assess suicidal thoughts, which he expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to a reduction in the "prevention of injuries" regime.
The army said that he used this restrictive regime (one degree under the regime of supervision due to suicide) to protect him and the security of others.
“I wanted the guards in prison to know that I’m okay and that I wanted to cancel this injuries prevention regime... so that I could enjoy an improved quality of life as he saw it here,” Manning said.
Manning on Thursday witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a prison at the Navy Base in Quantic in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking of suicide in Kuwait and once there, because of the heat, he was tired.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what will be with him and what is happening in the surrounding world was very scary.
“My world was just shrinking on the Arifjahan base, on that cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (minimum 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a cover, calls, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was over the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
He said that if the guard could not see his face when he turned to the other side in the night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the accusations he raised in a Thursday release, regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantic naked, he was also forced to stand naked before the guards and other co-prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning told him that he was not allowed to cover himself with his cover.
In a Friday investigation by the judge, Manning said that from the order of his guards he found that he had a cover that could be covered, to be delayed, but admitted that no one had issued the order to delay it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his calling to hurt himself, but he did not.
Manning said that that night his underwear, heads and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin in early next year, he will significantly decrease his punishment.
The defense said it planned that Manning would admit himself guilty in lower crimes and that he would fight against other accusations because they are too extreme.
The opening of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said the statement that Manning was held in accordance with the rules relating to all detainees held with maximum caution.
The accusations against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal causing the publication of intelligence documents on the internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is accused in all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I hardly passed through the crowd and arrived in the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I met a problem.
The flags pointed to one of the two fronts: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”) and the other for “Extranjeros” (“Strangers”).
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life was called a Mexican.
It’s an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves “Iry” and my friends in New York call themselves “Italy”.
So later I ended with the label “Mexican American”.
This was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home it was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary and I can’t get rid of American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in the front for "Extranjeros".
I thought about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
On the programme they had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same probability that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of weapons to rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, comments are everywhere.
So a minute after a representative of the United States says something just a bit critical about Mexico, you’ll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will go on the path of war.
And yet the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about enemy feelings?
These are a lot.
In Mexico there are both winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point of our family tree there was a person, a parent or grandfather to whom the opportunity was rejected in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than it seemed, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And beyond that we realize that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don’t like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they see us as a subordinate race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our connection to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is only a failure.
If our families did not fail in Mexico, they would never leave it.
And we would not now find ourselves imprisoned behind the silver curtain, with a good life in the United States, but yet with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is a tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans are unpleasant to carry it.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel as part of any one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You’ll get the best from both countries, but you don’t have the roots in one.
They look at us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
And to make the relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and push political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
No .
That will not happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are uncertain that it is a great country.
I think it’s up to you, friends.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States the way they negotiated with Mexico one and a half century ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unwilling about the way their family members were treated in a substantially closer past.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old Battle, New Middle East
The cessation of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be permanent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of blood flow suggests that every such event is useless.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings were transformed into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time missiles hit from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolitan, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although it seems that Israelis and Palestinians have been stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere around them.
The Arab spring has changed the old orders and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Per this will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can interrupt their deadly pat situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance it seems that there are not many reasons for optimism at this time.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21 lasted, the struggles of this week strengthened the struggles on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced Israel to withdraw, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the murder of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants in one of the most sad and populated corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And in fact, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its harsh rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined the side of Hamas.
Hamas people say that the Islamic Half Moon is surrounding Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruling, through Syria, where rebels, increasingly cloning to Islamism, can destroy Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas’ allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Murshi in Egypt, the far most populated and major Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despota who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player that cannot be excluded either by Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was deposited back in the box.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Coupé proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In the diplomatic terminology, America is as unwilling as usual.Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rocks from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicidal bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes in the West Bank, the main part of what a Palestinian state may be, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why do we disguise these propitious Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, would they not launch missiles, as their peoples did in Gaza?
It will be better if we keep them behind the wall and crack them when they scratch their heads.
Per the hard line supporters will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries don’t have Israel too much in love, their primary priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defence spending is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi has collaborated with President Barack Obama to a ceasefire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
In a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the vampire creates the rights of Palestinians to self-determination a shell with fire dust that one day has to explode in the Israeli occupied areas - just as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Nowadays, the repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demography is worsening this situation as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, which are held every several years in order to push Hamas, will be increasingly charged with diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and the following newspapers say: two states where Israel will move the territory for security reasons.
In the short-term perspective, there is a little hope that the ceasefire will give pressure from the outside at least a little greater impact on the prosecution of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to settle on the cessation of weapons supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside also have to push for a deal between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations for the creation of a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his part on how to get Israel to the negotiation table.
In his first election period, he neglected the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be equally disgusting in its entry into the process.
This is sadly short-looking.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian law on ugly cigarette packaging enters into force
On the unpleasant green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, entered into force, and the logos and brands were replaced by universal olive-green boxes with ugly images of the sick parts of the body and the display of children and newborns sick as a result of their parents’ smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes of labels, which are printed with the same small letter, is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the world’s most strict regime regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to prevent young people from smoking by removing this bad habit from its attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking until the age of 26, there’s 99% chance they don’t start smoking ever.
"Even with very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that, for example, have shown that children connect the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smokers in the world and the changes will have only a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry has hardly lobbyed against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have claimed that this law will increase trade on the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“These legislation will lead to serious unintentional consequences,” says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Falsificers from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging served to cover ugly boxes, two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 pieces to wholesale dealers and is expecting new stocks.
It is a good business for us.
As a possibility, experts report the popularity of social media among the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Through a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sports events, and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from a direct sight, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, the online space is for you an unbeatable place you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the “medium Honza.”
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and got the job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how it will load with new regulations rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far that it has paid to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the invasion of new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries does not trade significantly with Australia.
The implementation of the SOO decision is expected in the middle of 2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has conducted talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory warning photographs in 2001.
Now it has spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More strict laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no influence on me.
I just ignore them.
“You’re just pulling out the cigarette and pulling the box back,” says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of the tumor in the mouth.
To be honest, there’s only one reason to stop smoking, and that’s my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the unified boxes it is harder for him to balance them into the rocks.
"I took one hour to put the cargo out, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
“The government should simply completely prohibit them, then we would say, ‘OK, this is the end, we’ll close the bar’,” he said and decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it is not so bad to be bored.
The last Thanksgiving Day I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our aircraft had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next aircraft to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boring.
I will not lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming with praise of boring.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It will force the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen today, we have no chance of enjoying boring.
Should we support it?
Yes .
And not.
But I will return to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Nude) (Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, it has a long history,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription relating to fatigue, coming from the first century of our century.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredness.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boring as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me but I wasn't able to do it."
Foolishness is different from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything but wants to be.
It says that with apathy there is no compassion to do anything.
He says that the core of boredness is "the disturbance of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time."
Nude can remind you a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see a problem as an environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re tired when we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV show in the side room, others heard it so quiet that they hardly noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show quietly greater boring than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these trouble to boring.
When you try to focus on a difficult or attractive task, disturbance of attention can lead to boring, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "such as looking for bad components on the factory line, dispersing music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that turning and scratching, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight with boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
“The research shows that children who are allowed to wrap learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit quietly,” Professor Fenske said.
We’ve all ever experienced boring – my flight delay, a loud speaker, a long film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boring, scientists in the 1980s developed a "Boredom Proneness Scale" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally unacceptable.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were tired at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were tired when they were not at school.
3 percent of parents say they’re tired.
Professor Larson said he doesn’t know if the percentage expression of boredness would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that "adolescence is the peak time for boring," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “Is boring good for you?”
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addicts as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nudity is the brain’s way to tell you that you should do something different,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But your brain doesn’t always know the most suitable thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you’re watching television, it will make you happy only for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this independent management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to celebrate boredness.
But we should not be too critical to it.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of the constant drilling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
“We accuse her of having to get bored even more, but boredness is a painful, unhappy desire to be associated with something meaningful,” she said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
“In an environment in which we are constantly superstimulated,” he said, “it’s hard to find ways to get fun when noise is turned off.”
There is no guide to the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nine-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and footballer from Southeast Colorado, is accused of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and damp that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he walked with a few friends in Lamar, on plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was sentenced for possession of drugs and drug use equipment - small offences, for which each penalty is $100 - and the date of trial was set for him.
“They were treating us as criminals,” Mr. Orozco said.
Is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends rather on the site than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana-holding offences have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has ceased to blame adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado said they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still blame people for holding them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburb of Denver towards the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington.
And they’re looking for a guide to how to set a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale – all up to 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or in bad, is ahead of the majority of states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now even recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the licensing board for the sale of alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
“There is no real precedent that we could follow,” he said.
The Washington Act, so-called I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state license system, but legal holding yes.
And there are confused mechanical issues that need to be solved over this time, for example, how to balance the state directive on "adjust access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trading within 330 meters from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centers.
“No place will be harder to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently founded research group.
On November 21, the police chief Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail to his officials in which he informed them that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute crimes for possession of small amounts of marijuana in each citizen aged 21 and that the police will "with immediate validity" stop accusing people of these crimes.
The head of Oates said the police will pursue urban laws regulating medical marijuana farmers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the district of Weld in northern Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
At present, 119 people are accused of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them are facing further accusations.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated in places like the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of detention.
“I don’t think I’m losing my time continuing to pursue law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed, taking into account this great state green experiment, a profound dissolution among local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They spent so much of their lives persecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to build to a small amount of marijuana as to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for drug legalization.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales and are also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
The advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Ministry of Justice will subdue.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who take it that attracted attention, mostly the federal government has left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents will probably not open the door to catch a small pocket of drugs, they are likely to object to allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the drug policy of the President Obama administration.
Several Cologne cities do not wait for the progress of the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, although it will take about a year before any stores will be able to open.
Last week the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-year ban and it is likely to enter into force next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we’ll issue a license to someone and then we’ll have a big federal affair,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this addition.
We look at what the community voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I’m a conservative.”
Not only today’s students are attacked by their opinions.
I don’t remember I would never dream of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world’s largest foundation of knowledge, a modern ovined Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 80s of the twentieth century, within two weeks of entering the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my luggage and got into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I had objections against loving students in the side room.
The writer A. N. Wilson disguised that I was left because I was forced to drink from the shrinked pot.
The truth was less comic.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I was subject to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this column of supposed enlightenment it was both bigotical and barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher’s high-level adviser and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I’m pulling it out just now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students right from the middle suffer from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards conservative students in Oxford is so big that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political opinions they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and being shown that they are not welcome.”
They ask for a position in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their opinions.
Their situation was not helped even by the recent BBC Two documentary show entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right on a student political event that the conservatives described as strange and neonazists.
The show was presented by graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was driving the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver dress and had a pen with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "official sheep" due to the introduction of higher school fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association (Nottingham University Conservative Association), told Sunday newspapers that "left influence on universities is growing.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.”
The twenty-one-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant", while the nineteenth-year-old elected president of OUCA, Stephanie Cherill, says that the approach of members of the JCR to people right from the middle has deteriorated.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford I was a minority of one member.
I appeared in September 1986, 18 years old and shamefully shameful.
The hatred against the Conservative Party was the worst.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the award of an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in the funding of higher education.
Even the Stalinists are worried.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students get in touch with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the pellet that was to come.
I found that not only the teachers of silence approve the popping of conservative students, but they are also pleased to participate in it.
In the wooden auditories, the policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in the South African Republic was brought.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what followed.
“Slečno Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I was hard enough.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
“Thatcher people refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students wandered.
Tears went into my eyes.
“I suggest you take some basic lessons of French in your free time, if you’re not too busy with social affairs,” said Pitt.
I returned to my room.
During the dinner at school I sat alone when I felt a slight touch on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
Unfortunately it is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservation is a target.
It’s bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s going to be even worse for you.
The majority of conservative leaders pretend to be labourists.
Later, in the local bar, I tried to pretend frighteningly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (what's irony) went to Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students took a note with him.
I was wiped, dirty.
“How do the conservatives love each other?” one asked.
They blame each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with similar people only after the darkness?
Should I become a labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have evolved before me as a cleansing of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived at my faculty.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated this place because of his guiltyness and maliciousness, and because of his inclination to the marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to go from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, looking for a shelter with my uninterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn’t believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city of dream mood.
Even my communist friends had always the perfect ways.
His blurred eyes shaken.
Try it again.
I’m sure it’s just a joke.
My heart would be broken if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance worsened.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, understood pressure and gave up his belief.
The next week during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness declared that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was red inside, I acknowledged that "parents washed my brain" and called them "old fools".
The relief was short-term.
The knife in the box of my Oxford career was stuck by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week in the Murdoch newspaper.
My doors were locked.
I crushed inside and after five minutes my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in the educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which is also hidden to the present day behind the unworthy reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance than glory.”
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation" exhibition, which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host the exhibition of Valentina Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
“I love this castle,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his honorable clients he could not be written.
Valentino always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is covered by private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan through Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as the trophy of his social rise: from a simple crater from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemic cream".
To love the royal family is nothing wrong.
“They at least don’t catch a cigarette in a great carpet, as some wonderful pop music celebrity do,” says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chateau in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssena and a close girlfriend of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino had always preferred elegance than glory.
He is a star.”
Valeria Mazz to show Valentina
The Argentine model Valeria Mazz does not forget the charism of the designer.
“It’s been a lot of years since we went to him for dinner after a show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every tiny thing of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he reaped and was feeling his spirit.
All the guests thanks to him could feel important and loved,” the top model recalls, who began working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“He’s never out of fashion because his designs are artwork,” he concludes.
Show of arrogance
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was rebuilt into a special seventy-meter long passage that offers a role exchange: the visitor changes to a model and walks through the passage to observe the "community" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wear as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in the "Night", or the wave and skin jacket that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In the audience of the manicures are names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "this cannot be forgotten."
“I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, t-shirts, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
It was the gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer museums.
“I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women, because it emphasizes our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria says.
“I really like the colors it uses, it makes a lot of light and gives a ‘light’ to the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how Valentine was dressed for the first time.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she wanted to be a full-year-old and have the opportunity to wear some of his evening clothes...
It eventually arrived at the end of the 90s.
“I bought my first dress from Valentine for a celebration in the castle of my brother, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red clothes that had clothes with calls, a drawn livestock, and a top without the arms.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is laxious to fashion, his passion is overtime,” explains an Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's ceremonial dress "very carefully... because the dress isn't just a dress, it's also a set of memories they have in themselves."
The King of Fashion
The gold hole of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
To create these silk clothes of elephant colour with ally pearls, twelve types of different cracks and a four-and-half-meter length trail were required for four months of work and 25 "holes" (as the designer calls his cracks).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the top fashion intersection of the late 20th century, "return the client from the high society".
Valentino glorified over the years by the elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of the Honour Legion accumulate as much honour as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been attracted by his selection, calmness, adjusted and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
“The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great girlfriend.
He was unmistakable, and time left no trace on him.”
When the princess says that...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, indonesian volcano carriers gamble with their life and health when they carry 70 pounds of sulfur down on striking stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn life by conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, he has to fare every day to the bottom of the crater, where syrene gases escape from the inside of the Earth and when contacted with the air passes into a solid state.
After scratching large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, he takes them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the rough stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which stretches 2,386 meters, it’s just 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb the sharks at the pace up, because they keep the balance and thoroughly consider their steps so that they don’t slide and fall into the gap.
They know that any climbing could cost them life as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from the rock of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulfur they get out
When they are up, they raise their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lamps, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamity and even to whiten sugar.
“Because we usually wear 70 pounds, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” Anto explains, who usually takes three trips a day.
One journey takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) a day.
Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such unhuman efforts, it is three times the amount it would earn on the field.
For example, 15,000 rubles (1,2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection and the salary for fourteen days is two million rubles (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a wallman.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is in Indonesia as convincing as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he breats badly, he still cough and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to collect his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breats badly, he is still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for to his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” she promises more than stable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man struck by fate could be a tourist guide, servant or reception in the hotel, and instead does the job of a carrier.
It shares the dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and every day it rises at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur in the night does not cease to flourish and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and shines dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto fars into the crater and illuminates the way with a small light, which he has attached to his helmet and himself bought it for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers bring on their shoulder a cage with sulfur from the bottom of the crater.
Although the company has high revenues, it has not mechanized the sulfur mining due to cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to the carriers working on its own and with such an effort.
In fact, they don’t even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) from the extra fee for photography, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) are selected by the guard of the natural park from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for livestock, not for people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will continue to work "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and scratches in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and polls the miners in the thick outputs that come from the volcano, the miners are so claiming that no one of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can load only 50 pounds at his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues raise 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which then three trucks carry on a striking way between the hips to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik says, opening a wide mouth with a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, the thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the hardest craftsmen in the world continues from generation to generation - the craftsmen performing human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans deceive that they don’t have children, to career, stress and cost of living and education.
“The population of Singapore needs growth.”
I’m married and I’m a patriot, you’re my wife and you’re a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertising on mentol candy, but yet - or just because - with the video in Singapore early this year massively spread to YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local insights such as "we put the butter in the oven" as a laughter of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that this advertising will be able to point out the problem in a funny way.
Art Director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to take advantage of the influence of music to make people meet “their civil duty.”
"It's exclusively a matter of the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was the topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with feromons or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of the rape, to solve this problem.”

The one who doesn’t take it too much on a lightweight is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives' conservation and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans don’t have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Division of Marriage and Family of the National Office for Population says that it is because of "better education" and "more wide range of career opportunities".
“People so have a wider range of options available in terms of life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the delay of marriage and childbirth. The result is a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts in the immigration policy to drastically increase the flows of immigrants as a measure against the decrease of the population, this caused unrest among the local people.
Some of Singapore’s websites see uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and a little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, an effort came to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decrease in birth rate has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, Singapore has also had some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to influence real estate trade.
The Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boxes from shoes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and had great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can promote the youth lifestyle and disrupt developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive officer of EL Developers, claims that their “boots” are selling much faster than bigger houses.
"They are more popular, and so they are sold days to weeks faster than houses with greater area.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, they admit that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of a nation, a conversation with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the center of the city suggests that they won’t have a big effect.
“People are still in stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people are delaying,” the young official says.
“The rest have children.
But it’s important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are the Singaporeans who have the last word about building a family.
What is private offline is private and online.
and privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or "a area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the internet things that he’t tell anyone when he is in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico told five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely own" on a personal level and as "user name and password" when it comes to social networks.
"My greatest secret I't disclose," says the ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
“I’m making good photos and pictures on the fb.
I also talk to acquaintances.
I would not share a picture that would not be mine or a picture that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is bad to post obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or brutal comments.
Jorge says he knows all the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
There is also a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I have created a Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if someone will answer me, I’m just giving them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or quickly communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He would not even be interested if someone recommended him to someone unknown.
The case of Joshua is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and on the latter mentioned networks he acknowledges he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, no one of them told him for anything, nor wanted his address or phone number.
“If they urge me or demand it from me, I’ll simply remove them from my account,” he acknowledges.
José logged in to Ask after he read the recommendations on Twitter.
This guy is not a stranger experience with what is today called cyberbullying.
A friend on the social network has been raped.
They threatened and asked for money.
He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim has not been registered out of the account.
“It just activated a private regime.”
It then explains a series of steps to safely set an account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or shy situations.
“Of course I’d do it if someone bothered me or just wanted me.
“It’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents in social networks must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
“Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that the academic employee Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogics at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Indigenous and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital indigenous people are children and young people who are born in the era of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, we need to teach them, and we’re just learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, on the contrary, in an age when they are not yet mature."
Also to be – as regards the surroundings – reasonable, in a time when what they most desire is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences,” he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way is to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that force them to think.
“To tell them not to do anything doesn’t work,” he adds.
Moreover, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you would not tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo as you posted to a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you mark the people on the photos of the celebration, did you ask those people for permission?
And another: Do you need everybody to know what you are doing?
Another point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
They are the same rules.
"A person outside the internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be on social networks," he says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an educational counselor explains that it is necessary for children’s parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every mistake, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that the establishment of an account on the internet can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule "not talk to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by seven presidential presidents.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the UNASUR heads of states and governments, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office, who initially decided that the document will be published after the summit ended, said it would be published later on the website of the Peruvian government.
The content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the talks, a video from the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with the message "confidential meeting, the transmission of the sound was prevented".
A small amount of information that the journalists had available was provided by the press spokesmen of some governments who were present to the talks, but not by the Peruvian spokesmen.
The only document published during the talks was the list of participating presidents, which caused the wrath of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent to the media an e-mail with a “final statement” from the summit, but it’s just a statement by President Humala, not an official document that the summit closed.
Last October, Peru hosted the third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (America del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and even at this occasion the initially promised Declaration of Lima was not published, although the press was demanding.
On the official website of the ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities strived to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the supply of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which addresses the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chile's President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both sides to discuss the dispute that launched Lima against Santiago.
“We will make and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today at this international court,” President Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is, and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera added and greeted President Humal with a hand pressure at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court, which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision completely incorrect.
The summit took place without the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur in 2011 after the demise of then President Fernand Luga and did not participate in the meeting.
The host president Ollanta Humala was charged with opening morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were passed and 31 projects between South American countries were planned, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he said that the UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards a target in the form of South American citizenship, for which the settlement agreements are expanded."
He that actions are supported to improve cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve the availability of drugs and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters.
When Europe is in crisis, “the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a winning essence, but it must serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He pointed out that five of these projects concern Peru and its border edges from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerns a better connection with the Ecuador, but no more detail was stated.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve to its return to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit highlighted was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourhood relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice judgment concerning the maritime border dispute that is challenged by Bogotá.
“It’s possible that I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
“We are discussing all solutions, no ones are excluded, nor a deal with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country,” he said.
“I hope I will be able to tell President Orteg that we will conduct negotiations in the most civilized and careful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they will take part in the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
As part of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the issue of defence in the region.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on Peru’s state TV that Europeans “morded themselves during World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now they are practically one country.”
In this sense, he defended the South American citizenship project, which is supported by the Unasur member countries.
“It is necessary to the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already ongoing among the members of the Andes community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back into the past,” he said.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, stated that he agrees to the United States Organization (OAS) re-group under the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states will be reduced and those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
“The leaders are never committed to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is uncomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States,” he said in reference to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at that time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice, which asked him to be investigated on the Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, "with its own Swedish legislation allowing to conduct an investigation by a video conference call that could be conducted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he's had small lungs problems, but nothing serious," the head of state said.
But it is dangerous that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving on the fresh air.
It would be a sign of everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the settlement of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that London has been negotiating in order to resolve the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
“We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said, “If the UK gives leave tomorrow, everything will end.”
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it is easily permitted by the legislation there and as it has already been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be put to an end.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of the freedom of the press, and explained that he definitely does not tolerate "the submediate, the bad intentions and the lies that undermine freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not we, the underlying and deformed politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profits, pressures and chantage,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his pleasure that neither such journalists, neither banks, neither hegemonic countries, neither bourgeoisie control Ecuador, and said that if he was re-elected, he would "continue in the changes led in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain Paraguay’s veto on membership in the Unasur Union at least until its next elections and argued that the whole “must be solid and not tolerate opportunism and coup d’état covered in legality” because it actually “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay’s democracy.”
In addition, the President of the Republic of Ecuador said that he considers the "completely appropriate" desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the time after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which decided in favour of the Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
“It’s a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly, so that they can be overcome and there is a possibility to go forward.”
He also expressed hope to resolve the maritime border dispute, which is being resolved at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the opinion that “It is right for Latin America to seek an international instance if both countries commit to adopt a judgment, no matter how hard it is.”
In connection with the possibility that he will be elected in the next presidential election in Ecuador to be elected for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
“I personally never was interested in power, but such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must take this responsibility,” he said.
“If I win, it would be my last presidency and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I have decided,” he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
“I’ve just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says President Chavez has gone for a scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a recurrence in the presidential health,” he explained.
The head of the state of Ecuador took part today in the sixth summit of the head of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with challenges for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash hit me," he tells in remembrance of the moment of truth that the doctor tried to "a little relieve", but obviously without success.
The boy hidden it from his family.
He decided to take his illness himself on his beds and began informing about it. And that with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) didn’t say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut wound.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live fully with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who don’t know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused damage to the body and transmitted the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, “is a great success that the lifetime of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate way is completely the same as in healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of immune affection of the patients who are diagnosed with the disease, with better on those who do not take drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply said, this means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "when followed treatment, live without problems up to 75 years," the doctor explained in an interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is advisable to remind that the average lifetime of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the year of the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS – UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics, 60 percent of patients have died.
Only in the state of Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and until this year’s May so far 187. however, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirus drugs has been secured.
Why do people continue to die from the consequences of the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This is what happens in the hospital.
The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don’t know the state of the infection, i.e. in the late stage of the disease.”
He adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection is already manifested.The only thing we need to do to be able to more influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests on a large scale to detect the disease to all the people who ask for them."
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to make tests to a private laboratory just because it was done by his friend, and despite his low age he has already propelled AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor disease that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die, and they don’t want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’m better doing it three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was to better, I eat it healthy, I exercise, I take medications.”
Until now, his parents only know that he was suffering from cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who received the call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them do tests. if they risk, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it's better. and if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the motto of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms behind the pult
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who finds information about HIV.
The biggest gap is in prevention.
“In places dedicated to this task, the distribution of preservatives has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred preservatives, which is very good, but still there are people who do not have access to preservatives,” he said.
Among the most susceptible to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want it?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmaceutical staff and medical staff that teenagers want to avoid, the reporter says.
Let the preservatives not only be behind the pults, but those hundred let them be in the dosers on public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not promiskuity.
It’s not about paying them a beer and a motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question whether he would agree to the distribution of preservatives in his district.
“The best thing is to make preservatives available to those who already have a sexual life,” he said.
Key numbers in Jalisco
There were 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This state means in Mexico the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the infection occurs by sex, 6% by blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50 thousand people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The ruling approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognize the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt caused by a bankruptcy in Mexico, creates a bad precedent for any national enterprise with subsidiaries in a neighboring country and a problem of solvency.
Therefore, it seems that the processes of restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws, in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements, do not apply.
The approval of the judgment issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Halem at the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves in practice Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court to the main Mexican glass manufacturer with a appeal against three irregularities.
Initially, it should be said that while the judges of this case claim that creditors should follow the insolvency law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District based in New Orleans says that the main proceedings determine the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First of all, this would indicate the ignorance of international process cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, for this purpose, a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law was created, which by the arbitrator determines the organization of the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment stipulates that without the vote of the branches of the internal enterprise structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognized, the desired majority for approval of the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this possibility is accepted by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose internal corporate debts was liable by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Furthermore, it is true that even after the decrease of the votes of the branches, the creditors — who stood against Vitro at the court in the United States, i.e. the “sup” funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited — would not reach the majority.
The votes were approximately 45 percent to 37.
This fact is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - on the background of a serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzaleze Sady will appeal to the new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal, so that the assessment will be carried out with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since initially only three voted.
If he fails here, he will demand as a remedy the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the court has neglected the document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae, in which it describes in detail the Vitro's procedure under the Competition Act and indicates that the company has facilitated itself by attaching to the agreements signed by both countries to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
In addition, it points out that the country understood the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Total evaluation
Without notice, a few months of criminal notice was on the table of the Mexican Aviation trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Azcarrag Andradem, who was charged with fraud, and according to the pilot trade unions, the container has already flown.
The court, led by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in the proceeding of justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic about the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which the IXE bank from the fidecomis F/589 picked 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Air Force.
The funds were probably directed to the purchase of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles) shares.
As known, Azcárraga Andrade is a majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Dragon Mars
In the Universidad de Caribe campus, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered in the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about an enormous trade and distribution center with products from a "great wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which in the bottom would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (Camera Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the Southeast Zone to stand up against a monumental area that would partially destroy protected areas and which is the source of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which was not taken into account by the government and which asked for an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed in Japan the Commercial Agreement against Falsification, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial) was lost to date.
As known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the Long Term
In an attempt to repay long-term debts and not affect the short-term, the developing company Homex gives the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competitive is born.
The association of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, aimed at the market for software services in Central and South America.
Investments in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have so many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Before he was hit by a stroke on a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was burned into this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, player of the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, or president of the Portoric Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played a lot of roles throughout my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the chief executive of the national team and the chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled when he visited the journalists of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and reminder items from his long career, prove that.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest motivation of all the guards are those that remind him of his work in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owners or team owners.
“It was my best years, the one I’ve most, because I’ve had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as a owner, co-owners, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember that Gene Bartow, who was here before as a coach and at that time worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me, ‘I have a two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me the player Raymond Gausse, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings a win to Bayamon in the championship, Gausse will then contribute to the next.”
The championship, when for the team los Vaqueros played Gausse, was pleased, but only on a distance, since in 1988 he already performed the position of president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to dedicate himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position in the national team.
“I remember the first time we defeated the United States at the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then the World Cup came in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we had to have a bronze without the Canadian judge who allowed us to repeat the final throwing,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite was the national team at the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and scratched the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that blown us bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lopez and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who couldn't be in the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
The team that didn’t have the perfect composition, but was able to win us the gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the list, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded because of the match at the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we, despite all the forecasts, won gold.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His figures from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved at this level such results as Piculin.
Not to mention his performance in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Portoric coach?
This is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What is your biggest success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you not prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the contribution in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants of arbitrators and arbitrators.
That pleases me.
What are you engaged in now?
I most listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball matches.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, is worldly famous for the main role of John Rosse Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodies a man who acted carelessly and was malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of drunk oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in the new Dallas series, died according to a family official announcement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon from complications associated with cancer.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked most,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
He was unique and lived his life fully,” Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he drank a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found a malignant tumor on his liver and Hagman was transplanted.
Years before the Dallas series was broadcast, Hagman was famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (Jina) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast shortly, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well-accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repugnant J.R., who led him to the star peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayara?", which had to raise expectations about the work full of emotions, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only an enormous number of speculations from viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped this work to reach a record in tracking.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, watched an average of 41 million TV viewers. Dallas became the second most watched entertainment show in history after the completion of the 1983 MASH series, which watched 50 million viewers.
At J.R. he was shot by his cousin Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she did not leave the city.
Hagman played Ewing, an untouched jealous with a charismatic smile: a lazy entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who sought to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, closed into the hospital.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on the tomb stone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he failed.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "beautiful on the plate and outside."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of us all who had the luck to know and love him.
Ten pieces of the new Dallas series was broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth is just rounded," the television station.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT on how the series will continue.
A native of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who glowed in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan musicals.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, the lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the theater scenes in New York and then served in the British Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, with whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Prestona and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrity stayed.
In 2001 he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't have anything that I knew could hurt someone or hurt him somehow," he told Press Association.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped scary patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "Don't worry, it will be a bit unpleasant for a moment, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores “the end of the world”
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would make a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long number" of the May calendar, which is scheduled to come on December 21, has been captured by many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call "the debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, the place where, according to Christians theorizing the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told Rutgers University students this week in Camden, New Jersey.
When one discovers what is happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it’s really a good time.
And remember that bad means good for apocalyptic thinking.
And it’s not the only professor offering courses about the “end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, the professional assistant Barry Vacker organizes the course "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
“We’re understanding why these thoughts are expanding over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material gets into the hands of the terrorists, a war may begin.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic topics and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, gathered together to organize a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't join '2012' because we always count on the possibility to arrange the course again if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatening destruction", students have to study, create projects and make final examinations.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held in the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students another option than to work “until the evening of the predicted end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses have become very popular.
"It extended within two hours," Restall said about his course for high average students who were enrolled in 35.
We received e-mail questions weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester whether there is still a place.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said 23 year old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And thus, apocalyptic, secular or religious thought is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of the hour in which it could be taught before,” he said.
“I enjoy it.”
But no confessed student, even a professor, did not say they believe in the date of the end of December 21.
“Our first project discussed the May forecast and we’re rejecting it in a certain way,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
“The May have never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar,” Restall said.
But he added that in the western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that rises several centuries ago, which people react to the changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The speculation was caused by the internet.
“There’s no people thinking about it elsewhere,” he said.
This is the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who this year lectures in the Philippines, on the question whether he knows about any course about the "end of the world," replied quickly.
“The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote and suggested an exception at the Supreme Office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years it was talking about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "People will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken to light by students and teachers.
Some of them said they intend to go to the “End of the World” celebration.
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
