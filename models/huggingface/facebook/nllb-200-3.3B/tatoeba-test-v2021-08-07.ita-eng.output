White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - checkmate! This is jokingly referred to in chess circles as "silly checkmate".
White: rook in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the rook in a6, after which Black has only two options: take the rook in a6 or move his bishop in any other check on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and gives checkmate. In the second situation, white takes the pawn in black a7, with the same result.
