A 9-year-old boy was found on the streets of Tampere
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy who was found in a car in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing boy who left West Tamper with a friend has been reported on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told Night Snows at midnight knowing the boy had been found.
He's fine, and we're starting the follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, his father said.
Ronaldo is back on the scene . He 's a big shot .
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his performance in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League's painting feud turned, for a moment, in the latter's favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of the all-time scoring list alone after he hit a striker Shahtar Donetsk on the net with two penalty kicks and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his marathon to 80 when he had 77 hits at the Barcelona Messe before Tuesday.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have been competing in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League D division they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal came 10 minutes before the end of the game for Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, a quadriplegic.
Aguero, who was injured in a weekend soccer game, didn't get on the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester United's second team also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands after a 1-2 loss to PSV Endhoven.
The guest contest for 20-year-old ManU law enforcement official Luke Shaw lasted only a quarter of an hour.
The dangerous-looking slide call from PSV's Hector Moreno hit the paint towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely broke his ankle.
Shaw slept on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno's tied the game before the break.
The PSV winning goal came in the second half from Luciano Narsingh.
The season of the Champions League was marked by the start of the A-League Paris Saint-Germain.
The case involved the Argentine Angel Di Maria, who changed the shirt of Manchester United to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 at PSG in the second half.
PSG has been voted the best team of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's minor league teams, is not the best possible reference point.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has faced his professional debut against Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsKA lost to Wolfsburg 0-1 in the B-League in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation . The president gave a wrong speech .
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, was giving the same speech he had a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has delivered the same speech to the country's parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised questions about the fullness of the 91-year-old Mugabe's powers.
The main opposition MDC has demanded Mugabe step down from his post because he is too old to rule.
Mugaye's aides rushed to say that the interference had taken place only in Mugaye's office and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's impact on the economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have postponed an extra EU leaders' summit due to the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who is leading the summits, will consider the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make their entry into Europe more efficient.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of the interior ministers, Merkel said.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The only voice is a slightly colored university teacher Shannon Lamb, who is telling the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that her golden dog is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's relatives are found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentice's body and a handwritten message on the page of the anger: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this one I loved, Amy, and she's the only woman who's ever loved me", said the letter, which experts say is signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the campus of the school where police believe he shot and killed the longtime history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this classroom.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the University's staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more: Lamb committed suicide while surrounded by police.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motives the day after students and staff were forced to hide behind locked doors because of school shootings.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released data showing that students and staff described Lambi as a gifted teacher, but he may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for her feelings.
The police at the scene of Prentice's death, Gauthier, say Lamb has no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in a social science and history institute with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambi, but he also said that he seemed nervous and restless, as if something were wrong.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lambin told him that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously applied for medical leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some sort of health problem.
This year, she only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's salary policy meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him an automatic career development and an assistant professor position.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to his knowledge, but that Lamb clearly had something in mind.
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb escaped from campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, reported Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city of about 12,000 people.
Lamb graduated with a PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
She was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were just melting when he was there, said 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's Brandon suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the riverfront in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
"He's really upset", O'Steen described her daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said that he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played a couple of gigs together.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and occasional entertainment host at The Julep Room, a bar in the confused neighborhood of Gauthier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentice on the night of September 5th, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip ballads for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were playing and throwing punches at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The late Professor Schmidt led a first-year seminary program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia, Kansas, and was the spokesman for his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candlelight vigil was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, Ohio, attended by about 900 people, including faculty and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the Mass, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The class will resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to get better.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press reporter Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans were involved in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police now say Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentice as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it does not hire as many workers for the holiday season as last year, but the toy and baby-shop says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interview process for applicants will begin this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
With months of holiday, Christmas shopping is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupancy of stores, as well as the sale, shipment and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox joking about his date with Princess Diana.
The premiere night of Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was right next to me", she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts and I remember being just a little bit of a fake stretcher and a handshake away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary film about Back to the Future, which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future got its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "For me, it is without doubt the greatest time travel film of all time.
Back in Time is available on video, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says the Syrian situation will not be resolved by weapons
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict will not be resolved armed, and the additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - later this month during the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of powers between the Council, the Syrian people and regional actors had made it impossible to resolve the situation.
The Committee also called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unanimity in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they did in reaching an agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
Eight of the poll results show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a windmill.
Some people think he's just kidding.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to squeeze Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys, 10 have been led by Donald Trump in double digits, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for real estate prospects.
Of course, the election season is still in its infancy.
These results don't mean Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee.
The comments point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom was backed by any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he might have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noticed Trump's stubbornness and have begun using their resources to bring him down.
The following recent results of the profit and loss survey suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have made a complete change.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two Republicans out of ten had a positive attitude toward the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a Quinnipiac University poll in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they favor Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy if Trump were to run.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "interested" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be shocked if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is getting almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% of enthusiasts vs. 40% of Trump).
Next up, the most exciting?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be either dissatisfied or upset if Jeb Bush, the leader's favorite, were to run.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, a poll by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday found that 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide believe the real estate king has the characteristics that are appropriate for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's poll last week, the number in Iowa, which is hosting the first party congress, is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the quality of a leader.
However, according to a survey by ABC/Post, 44 percent think that he is not fit to be president, and nearly six in 10 believe that he is not a member of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is the real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of 10 people thought Trump was the most likely candidate to be nominated by the Republicans.
As late as July, four out of ten voted for Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
At this time in the last election, four out of ten Republicans voted for Rick Perry to be nominated, and only 28 percent voted for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe Trump's campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand for another candidate, Trump would still win almost every one.
Some commentators have noted that the fractured field has likely contributed to Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support has been shared among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's on a level playing field with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate Trump has ever won?
If they were put up against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a whopping 18 points.
And the very majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they've made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just slightly more than half of Trump-supporting voters have decided who they vote for.
Naturally, things can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could change candidates.
Anyway, Trump's biggest competitor right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rape" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's arrogance will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
A new ABC/Post poll published Monday found that six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of 10 Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll Monday they preferred someone outside politics to someone with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa found that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated with the Republicans in Congress: 54 percent were dissatisfied and 21 percent were angry.
The first meeting of Jeremy Corbyn at the prime minister's interview
Corbyn 's first public appearance at the polling hour has been eagerly awaited since his election .
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is meeting with David Cameron for the first time at a prime minister's hour.
Corbyn will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon and likely will be closely watched by both the media and Labour MPs.
Corbyn has demanded less theatre and more facts for this weekly show.
He's also said he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to take care of.
This confrontation is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Association of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision by the Labour leader to stand silently during the national anthem at a memorial service on Tuesday, the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and has been featured on several front-page issues.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A Corbyn spokesman said he was respectfully silent and that he acknowledged the bravery of the RAF in the UK's air war.
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite his view that the Royal Houses should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements over economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supporting him as leader.
The BBC's policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the lines on the party's position in the European Union and government subsidies have also been 'reduced' within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told a meeting of the Central Trade Union Congress that the Labour Party was proposing an amendment that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Smith, said the party was "very clear" that they were merely opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has put ideas together for the prime minister and received over 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, MP for Islington North, has said that the nature of the prime minister's questionnaires is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both cunning wording and gossip, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Shadow Cabinet Secretary Angela Eagle will take his place in the interviews when Corbyn is not involved, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues may also be allowed to speak at some point, and he has said he has approached the House Speaker, John Bercow, from the teams involved.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theater that is often associated with prime minister interviews, but he later admitted that he had failed.
Since they began to be broadcast in 1990, the prime minister's questionnaire has been an important measure of the leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized the questionnaires for being a satire that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
However, a group of former Canadian children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make a profit.
BBC News met one of the first young graduates of the project.

The value of the pound rises as wage growth in the UK accelerates
The value of the pound rose after figures appeared to rise in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidding zone SABMiller.
Between March and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the increase in rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% to $1,5505 and EUR 0.84% to EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed at 1.49% rise to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinguished market share and rose by 20% after being approached by competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest banks and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stake rose 0.9 percent after receiving encouraging news from a rival luxury group in Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected and furthermore showed that sales in China, which is Burberry's key market, had begun to rise again.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mond were the largest bearer in the index at 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation of the company to myy.
JD Sports increased by 3,1% after the sports carrier published its pre-tax profit for the six months: an increase of 83% to £46.6 million.
According to the CEO of JD Sports , higher salaries could hurt the expansion .
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage is raised in the UK, it could mean that the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill argues.
The costs could be linked to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against Aldi's infiltration.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA merchants in South and Western Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store in South and Western Australia early next year, with up to 120 stores to come, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food vendors and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmos are offering snacks at IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to their Australian football fans.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when it organises the annual Investor Strategy Day, a day for wholesalers of food, alcohol and rail equipment.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of the area of IGA trading in Metcash and have higher yield margins than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
The South and Western Australian retailers are well known to be cornered, and IGA retailers have a much larger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west, generating revenues of between $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor with a market share of EUR [...] million.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, head of the investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a trade fair in Melbourne that Metcash could potentially lose in a decade.
Metcash has declined to comment publicly on Douglas's comments.
However, it is understood that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010 and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA resellers, have decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, wholesalers have kept their tabs on the side, investing over $150 million a year in lowering prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths each week, helping IGA resellers to refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and bringing a better selection of private label products to market.
The Commission has also examined the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment, including the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment.
The president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy supports Thanasi Cook
Thanasi Cookman deserves credit more than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered a recent by-storm surrounded by his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
The younger member of the talented duo known as the Special Ks, Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed to publicity for the incident in which Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a fiery brawl in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Cook from his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared, "Wawrinkan should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that bastard".
Although Cook's last appearance was after a cramp ruined his eventual win over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Cook's unstoppable defender.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from second place in a doubleheader with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I'm pretty sure Thanasi was just drawn into the bombing", Healy said.
He broke his record when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his record when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he's been acting exceptionally well, even in quite provocative situations with Harrison at the US Open and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's very mature at 19, he's hardworking, he's fit for the team, and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players, and he's appreciated in the dressing room, he's trained hard, he's in good shape, and he's a pretty calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged by his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take Kirgizi to the important games starting on Friday, describing this joint decision as a good solution for all, but I support Canberra's return to the regular season.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgyzstan]", Healy said.
And Nick has grown up really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's growing up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time outside of public thinking about those consequences.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of reducing the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted in shock.
People fleeing violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and set up indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But the frustration grew.
As the police helicopter stopped above them, the migrants shouted 'Open the border!' and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was impossible to accept the return of migrants from Hungary, as more and more of them were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels, Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The border dispute between Hungary and Serbia came about after the 28 national groups failed at a controversial meeting in Brussels on the nature of the common immigration policy.
The ministers agreed on the responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers now occupied by Italy and Greece, and spoke with optimism about reaching a final agreement - by the end of next month or next year - on which EU countries will take in 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria call for an extra EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis next week.
Hungary does not, however, hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to act in crisis situations and allowed for road closures and speeding up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to build a barrier on part of its border with Romania to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie DAgata reported that even prisoners were recruited to help finish the barrier between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point for refugees into the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life and not war refugees entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize the company's crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia and include longer jail terms for convicted human traffickers.
Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're very clear on this: crossing the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military position expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached farther.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody, and are being charged with violations of new laws.
The authorities are gonna fix the fence fast.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the Serbian border on Tuesday morning after sending a train train to close one of them.
The main border crossing near Roszkė, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal box for handling people and crowds tried to break in.
About 20 people got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main roads between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: According to a national poll, Hillary Clinton's leadership of Bernie Sanders has shrunk by half.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the Democratic nomination race in a two-digit format, but Senator Bernie Sanders has been holding her back.
Clinton now has 47 percent of the Democratic vote (down from 58 percent) and Sanders, the runner-up, 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say who they would have voted for.
But Clinton's supporters are more firmly behind his choice than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined in a few segments of the population since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader in women and moderates, but her leadership has shrunk.
His popularity among men has fallen dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among the under-50 Democratic voters has been lost, and he's now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton clearly leads the way with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by a double-digit margin with the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country say they will be enthusiastic about Clinton if he becomes the party's nominee.
Fourth says they support him with a certain reservation, and 15 percent would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely enthusiastic about supporting him.
The opinions are more confused with those who are not currently in favor of Clinton. Only a quarter would be enthusiastic about his support.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republicans (35 percent) say the same about Republican first lady Donald Trump.
When Clinton's supporters were asked openly why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she had the right experience (16 percent), followed by the most popular answers being that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the office (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cited his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is affecting a possible presidential run, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagrees.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would vote for Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will grow from Sanders, and if Biden leaves, the lead will be 20 percent, but if he leaves, the number will be 30.
55 percent of Democrats say Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
With this measure, Biden is far away, but the share of those who think he's the most eligible to vote has increased.
However, when asked what the Democratic candidate is most interested in, they raised their views to the vote.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or prospective candidates are doing well in certain key areas among their party's voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden is the best of the three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as Sanders (15%) but 27 percent say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in agreement.
And when you look at all these things, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server as Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are happy that she explained the matter and say it did not affect their public opinion on her.
But it's a different story when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third are.
Public opinion split in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email politics has not affected their overall assessment of Clinton, although 36 percent say they have a deteriorating opinion of her.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Even though Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and credible, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, with only 32% considering him honest and credible, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people don't have an opinion about him, and neither does Carson.
The margin of error in the survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in a national interview
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times interview.
In a new poll, two candidates collected half of all the votes, leaving the rest to fight for the pedestrian.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, who has risen from 23% of the CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election to 27% of the poll released Tuesday.
But Carson rose dramatically from 6 percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well in different demographic groups and is alienating Trump from the highly educated Republican vote.
The rest of the field is left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has the lowest turnout of any governor in Wisconsin, Scott Walker, from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6 percent.
The margin of error in the most recent survey of 376 Republicans in September is +/- 6%.
Last week, the latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson's share of the vote was rising: he has a 19 percent Republican majority, and Trump is 32 percent ahead of him.
Also, according to the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump unnecessarily criticized the retired neurosurgeon, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after a student died at a fraternity symposium in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during a September 2013 membership dispute, and then delayed his transportation to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Officials say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back loaded with over 20 pounds [13 kg] of sand, after which he was repeatedly trampled to the ground as he tried to walk through the icy field toward the paint.
Eventually Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The brothers did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but the charges said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Dengi's clothes, search the Internet for information about his symptoms, and contact the national president of the Brotherhood, Andy Mengi, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus put the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's", said Chief Wagner.
Dengi was never able to be resuscitated, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blows from the boring object to the head, body and legs.
Lots of families have suffered from the fraternity effect, with at least one student dying every year since 1970, said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Superior Court upheld the charge of third-degree murder of the first five members.
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent bribery and criminal conspiracy.
"We do not want to hold individuals responsible, but if there is an organisation behind what happened that has acknowledged the situation, either formally or informally, they must also be held accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity severed its ties to the local chapter.
This is what happens when the US central bank raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will have to recede.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past hardly provides any help in timing, specifically when it comes to the economy.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first increase, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The US central bank's aggression in raising interest rates has often, if not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the central bank officials have been so keenly emphasizing that investors should focus not on the rate hike but on the trend towards normalization.
There are indeed several variables in the relationship.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all the confusion related to the increase has been overblown.
The first surge since the global financial crisis by the central bank is inevitably interpreted in some quarters as the end of the era of cheap money, said Julian Jessop, global finance expert at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, to the level of a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an effect.
The following is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will respond to past developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last month or so, the expectation of interest rate increases can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not so dramatic.
It appears that capital yields tend to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years or so, the market has generally been strong, rising by about 14% when approaching a rise, 250 days later it is fairly steady (average rise of 2.6%) and normal status has been achieved after 500 days with average returns of 14.4% over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, senior capital strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
Deutche Bank notes that the effect on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often promote their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been present before and that could accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of GDP, which will be near its all-time low before the central bank's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been less than 4.5% only twice.
While the figure was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will be stable, with the third quarter having grown by 1.5%, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
In such a fragile economic environment, interest rates can be ris­ky and raise questions about whether this time will be different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for the central bank's increase throughout the year and are all looking forward to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe the Committee can approve the increase at this meeting, the futures trading forecast was only a 25% probability.
Our research shows that since 1950 all cycles of upward trend have so far been increasing in the supercycles of the upward trend, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun, the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the worst recession in recorded history.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been overwhelmingly waiting for the end of the last recession: a record of 35 months and now 74 months.
The fixed income has also been unstable as the market awaits interest rate rises and the model is somewhat similar to the capital observations.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its course, its effects are more pronounced on debt than on shares.
The direction of the yields of the bonds appears to change immediately at the first increase/reduction of the cycle.
At the end of the interest cycle, the yield on the debt will decline immediately, Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a convergence of longer and shorter term debt yields, thereby balancing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this situation, although we are still cautious about seeking returns, said Kathy Jones, a firm return analyst at Schwab, in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes the market has already adapted to the central bank's linear expectations.
In addition to the weakening of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market is adapting to the prospects of tighter monetary policy, he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, yield curve is flatter, uncertainty has increased and instability has increased - all of which are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies that are mainly based in the USA will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt are worse off when the dollar's rise makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have financing.
History shows that high-quality stocks are generally more profitable within three months of the first draft, Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to clients.
The companies with strong turnover outperformed the companies with low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
The companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than the low-interest companies, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is gonna be a big problem.
The companies with high variable-rate debt are the ones with the biggest losses, Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of inciting the public to
He claims that differentiating it from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just travelling to the Brit Awards.
Co-Chairman Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying that it's not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is changing to Classic FM, claiming a leading MP is adding pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something commercial production companies don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio programme was influenced by its 'popular' content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitor.
It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "crowd-friendly" - is turning into Classic FM, he said.
He also took part in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, are a different kind of Brit Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I can remember right now of actually just copying something that's already on the market, Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it came to live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches you things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"I think it's also very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's head Alan Davey argued that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's supply that was criticised for interfering with commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sport Selection Committee hearing.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins has criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is so often discussed, since it is neither original nor self-labelled?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 show, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George as the stars, was produced in the BBC's style.
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside their own house" the next time it starts the show.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to require that the money of the licensees be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales are down so far in August, and Black Friday may be the reason.
Net sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the rise was the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales reinforced the use of mobile devices to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could help control consumption.
Virtual shopping has grown tremendously over the past decade, turning many of Britain's shopping slums into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a leveling-up in online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total expenditure in August was the lowest since statistics began in 2000: only a 5% increase from last year.
The experts say there are signs of a flattening of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
If we look back at the growth rates of previous years and look back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be more rational over time, Andy Mulcahy, the editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when shoppers began using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could do it in different environments, like on a couch.
But now it's going to level up, and it can drop.
The Black Friday phenomenon in America has been considered one of the reasons for the slowdown in trade.
Experts believe that consumers will be able to control their purchases before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers scrambled their computers to capture merchandise, knocking down many merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which has led buyers to argue over the findings, could curb shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five items were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping malls.
Muslims bury the dead in the Mecca lifting accident, with consequences for bin Laden's family
29 bodies were carried across the streets during the first Muslim funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured when the lifting truck fell down.
29 dead were carried through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the elevator collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, dressed mainly in white, filled the route to honor the first dead who made their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad journey passed a sacred place where just a few days ago a lifting bell fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the bin Laden family's construction company was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed by the elevators in the Great Mosque of Mecca were carried across the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram Bolton, the father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the elevator collapsed.
Akram had been in a large mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already sworn that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the elevator up a quarter when it was not in use.
The decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, in Arabic, stated that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not give this detail, but it said that the company's executives were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the curtain to fall on the grounds of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements of the collapse of the disaster and its representatives have not been arrested for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the association of not using up-to-date protective equipment and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifting towers around the Great Mosque of Mecca, part of a massive construction team led by the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and they lead major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The storm came in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered a million riyals (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and the permanently injured.
The other wounded will get half of this amount.
B&Q boss says eastern European cheap laborers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened.
Meanwhile , Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country .
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and their painting pins and to hire skilled East European workers to do home improvement work.
It seems that if you're a knife-wielder or a wall-painter, you're in the minority these days.
The British are increasingly hiring assistants to do do do-it-yourself jobs at home, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, a home improvement retailer, said that the popularity was due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offered their services at a discounted price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wanted more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 shopping decisions made at the stores were made specifically by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff is men.
He said that the changes in population must be taken into account: there are now more single-women households with more home improvement work than ever before.
Laury said: "Most of our retail staff are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of our product purchases are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK's leading FTSE100 companies, and has rebuilt her management team to include men and women alike.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with 50% female members, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision. Differentiation is important here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both sales and sales for six months after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, the brand Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other wage-earners' centers began to be forced on the spot, and as a result the country stands up on Friday because of the large protest of workers.
I think a lot of people think that makes sense.
We'll ask if it's worth the strike, if it's going bad.
There's even been a resistance movement.
Over 50,000 people have already gone online to say they're not going to participate in the demonstration, they're going to work.
In the old days of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare yourself a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small man.
The protests of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions do not take much time, but they give us reason to think.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement for themselves, the values have changed
In view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly self-imposed pressure, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights, clearly and properly.
The government may thus wish to reinforce the role of the ay movement when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever we think about the activities of these organizations, it is absurd that a Friday protest would stop Finland.
Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
I'd think these things would make everyone's head spin.
A strong savings target for the University of Lappeenranta: 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a savings programme with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of the savings, the University is launching negotiations on the total staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million a year.
In practice, that means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are aimed at a further saving of 2 million.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which forecasts a deficit of 8,5 million for actual activity.
This will also be affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university produces approximately 2.6 million shortcomings.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but the same Ministry's funding will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The impact of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is showing up at new levels.
The negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to go to Finland
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of Onnibus, a low-cost bus company, told Yelle that the company also aims to operate rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the nearby transport of the capital area in 2017-2018.
After the nearby traffic, it's the long distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approaching the Department of Transportation.
The Ministry of Transport has said that the plans for Onnibus are welcome.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
The US central bank must make decisions about interest rates .
The rest of the world is watching from the sidelines as the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a Reuters survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week now believe that the situation is still unresolved and interest rates are held at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Central Bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to move from zero to normalize interest rates, said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing relatively well, and the recovery has brought in trillions of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to take it up, but the signs also show that they believe the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left a note apologizing .
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting her colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "reeling" from the first murder and hoped it could be canceled, authorities said Tuesday.
Mississippi State Police said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he killed his wife last night and also mentioned that there is a dog in the house who is not bothering anyone but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't say it.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb handwritten note that read: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to his knowledge, but that Lamb clearly had something in mind.
Officials said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was involved in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no information or evidence of any kind of 'triangle drama'.
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentice for about seven years and described her as a "good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were, for all intents and purposes, best friends.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them he wasn't going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over to the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb was a student of education at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a graduation list on the university's website.
Stars That Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
He also reportedly had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really takes a toll.
Manchester United 's Luke Shaw has been out for months for a double fracture .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg when he lost to Manchester United in the Champions League match to PSV Eindhoven.
Even though the defender was in tears and has been out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's hollow blockage 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw had jumped into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now".
He's transferred tomorrow, maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, this boy comes to Manchester United at 18, he's in trouble, and then he's playing great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen tank.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in a block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get either a red card and a penalty shot.
The judge, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian newsman was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it turned out to be a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged slam.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is now beginning, I will come back stronger".

The English defender has a further incentive to recover from the European Championship next June in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very serious injury.
If one player gets out because of this injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players never intend to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's Van Gaal against Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
Moreno takes this seriously because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing, Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's grip.
Moreno told SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado, a PSV member, was also taken to hospital after being questioned by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows Lorax better than this.
Every parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before he learns it almost completely.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When the prime minister's holiday care service asked him for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a post on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "It's fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message.
All of this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to fill the rather short original text.
In the walled city of Tarvillen, where all nature has been lost and even air is a commodity, Ted's boy hopes to win over his dream girl's heart by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see a real tree, a love story that Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it were taken from a plot summary of the Lorax movie from the Internet Movie Database, which begins: "In the city of Needle within the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted's boy hopes to win over the heart of his dreams, Audrey's girl".
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he was so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greed, a wood-cutter and a need-picking Cherry, regardless of the short, sharp creature named Lorax, who speaks for the trees.
This relatively invisible PR task is likely outsourced to a helper who apparently has never read a book to a child 20 times in a row.
The prime minister's spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined by the England team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but seeing what team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last 3-0 series loss will happen again.
I wouldn't take away a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three-year-old side, but it does have good rowing teams and a strong team mentality: they have no scar in 2012, only young positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing his rounds and Adil Rashid is the offensive choice, although he's an unknown at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult for me to analyze, as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but bitter truth is that cricketers are judged on their performance.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have gone on, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes up.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't doing as well as he could have done, and it doesn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the punches have to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected to the national team seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was at his peak, but that lost opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a lot of hits I appreciate.
He's got the cricketer thing that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this will depend on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a lot of talk about Moeen hitting a home run next to Cook, giving him an extra hitter on the field but keeping him four-quarter-pointers, and I'm not against that.
I don't understand why batsmen can't hit there, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be a pretty good cricketer.
Moe may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he's a threesome to them, and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games on the first lap before moving to the opening in 2001.
He scored 300 points in one minute and never remembered the past.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup, and, the little I've been dealing with, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unadorned stats -- hitting an average of 31 with a ball of 35 -- and think it's gambling, but there aren't too many pitchers available, and the picks chose the young ones.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the squad, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing the Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games could prove to be a brilliant gesture.
He's one of the coolest guys in the game, and he brings a tremendous amount of experience, because he's done everything in every situation and against every kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is coming to the White Ball Games, bringing with him both energy and a relentless disappearance.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same useful mind as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Collin's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being laid off on the one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and recruits don't make schedules.
And we have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on lightly ground.
Brexit supporters could profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hour strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more troubled, even if the heartfelt Jeremy is not taken into account.
Foreigners have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragens, too.
A European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply embroiled in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centred agenda of Britain, which is full of disagreeable concessions and disruptive changes to the treaties that these countries do not want to see.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Association of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them if they were to undermine social protection.
I mean, we could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and the finance minister, late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local eyewitness, and then come home saying they are winning supporters of reform.
It's all about me.
A European friend of mine, who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France, they say from Berlin - suggests that the shortest-looking ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
The cautious and moderate German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to step down before it goes to waste, just as she did for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland of France is due to be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a force to be reckoned with, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the self-made British when their energy should be directed to preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so either because of their own similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The negotiations on the new airline were an arranged affair and the negotiations on the new airline had no meaning for Britain
Europeans have been given a hard time of experiencing the greed of the Fleet Street press and the EU-skeptic monopoly of the press, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum, inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can only remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself writing about the EU's direct bananas while he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
Among them were a number of tax-invited tax-defeating criminals, foreigners who hacked their phones, and individuals whose home address is elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the fog, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation, for Bair had accepted the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who graciously slapped me on the back at the Westminster House of Parliament on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), would seem to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott of Murdoch, a strategy that was a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC counterpart Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully put, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party's Ukip's wartime passion and the fiercest nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly support this opinion.
Hilary Benn, but not Benn-Fanni Benn, said this on both radio and television this week, when her inner patrolman wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the tough John McDonnell Shadow Secretary of State was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his grandfather was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his Labour colleagues in government without going so far as to lose his seat.
Hilary's flat surfaces were more attractive.
But the fight to stay involved in the situation wherever it is - the Benni statement - was not what McDonnell said, and not, by any means, what Corbyn told the prime ministers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in the twists and turns of social media, which is a welcome growth barrier to persecution and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair that Cameron is not given a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to make the Labour Party's support for the referendum campaign obvious.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the basic rally of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of minor differences is a central dogma in academic skirmishes.
As for his dualism towards NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would Paris or Berlin (which also have suspicious voters) waste political capital on concessions to Britain when it can be totally useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed in the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts have criticized the Public Health England e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people who had ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its 'pivotal report' last month, describing it as 'an overview of the evidence'.
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data, referring to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published a major paper last month attacking the exceptional hypocrisy of the PHE's general conclusions.
Two other researchers in the BMJ have been debating whether the claims were made on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Europe, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: 'The main principle of public health is that practices must be based on proven effectiveness.
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence that according to the best estimate available, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages of combining different nicotine products, and the results of this meeting were summarized for the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also supported BAT's public health recommendations in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report receiving funding from the industry.
The others on the scene are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of PHE.
The group's research is very pleased to admit that there is a lack of undeniable evidence of the harmfulness of most products and most criteria, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that there is no evidence at present that e-cigarettes act as a route for premature smoking in children or non-smokers.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellness at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says: "Electric cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking".
Half of the people who smoke in their lifetime die from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence -- that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harm is only a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco -- we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders or The Voice and that commercial competitors should give anything away from the heat of this soap show on Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fees should only be used for programs that other British missionaries do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes with a lower audience at low broadcast times against competitors' most-watched programmes and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said he tried to build a relationship with the BBC in the six years that he spent at Channel 4 in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that are clearly suitable for non-subsidised competitors", Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is kept - and I'm not sure that would be a good idea for this communication or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others don't make and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast at the most important times because we want to raise as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: 'I don't understand why regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded even without state aid.
The Voice is one of those, and EastEnders is another, no doubt, made inside the house.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything of it.
I don't understand how that's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting down viewers because of the goals of the people who work at the station and because they believe it is the best way to get long-term support.
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC should sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes go to BBC4, where the number of viewers is often not measured, but the BBC is thus fulfilling its responsibilities and can then, in defending £4 billion in licence fees, hypocritically state that 'of course we are making all these unknown programmes that no one is watching'.
They put them in a post where no one will ever see them.
As for the payment of the bond, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in which the highest return is paid.
And of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but I don't know if that's true for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its role in Reith's time as 'informing, educating and entertaining'.
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be modelled on Australian and Canadian broadcasts and transformed into the mission of 'reporting, enlightening and entertaining.'"
As for the partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms, which he said are only shown on television, and partner with commercial companies to make them all available online.
Sound genetics allows brain cell control by means of sound waves
This video shows how the shuttle's planes change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
Small shuttle jets change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound pulse too high for a human ear to hear.
The pulses work by connecting genetically modified motor neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound.
Related: Researchers reading and writing brain activity in light
Scientists said that the worms were demonstrating the effectiveness of a new method called sound genetics, which uses ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could someday replace deep-seated stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttle's trains don't normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani noticed that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, things changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced the ultrasound waves, which then passed into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-guided shuttle jets, Chalasani genetically modified the worms to have TRP-4 ion channels in part of their motor germ cells.
When the chalasani used ultrasound on modified carpets, the microbeams amplified the sound waves and transferred them to the carpets, where they connected the modified motion cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenesis may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must send optical fiber to a desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound can pass through tissue unhindered, so it can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus could make it possible to instantaneously get targeted human nerve cells to respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture device delivered to your home!
The ads could embarrass the arms trade in Britain
Watch the video of Amnesty International's anti-status fairs.
Terrible killing machines!
You're a bunch of fucking fucking foot cars!
- What are you doing?
And electric sedation pumps that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and graphic language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest stock exhibition is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to trade arms to repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in the London dockside.

A special campaign also produced numerous posters at bus stops and subways demanding more detailed information.
 Important information, Are you travelling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September? together, using the London Underground font and brand name, when the DLR route becomes a tank image.
This September, a swarm of gun dealers will arrive on the DLR route... asking customers to help stop the station fairs.
These 300 posters are the work of artists whose work was on display at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using the Ad Space Hack Packs, a six-pound package of six-wheeled keys that the collective says will provide access to a third of the advertising space for bus stops on the planet.
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised 'information vandalism'.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professor of art at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance movement when they realized that they had to go to the outside world if they wanted their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms billboard welcomes workers on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours, and was made free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and background narrator who worked for free.
Matt Leverin, creative director of the VCCP, noticed that the job fairs were not advertised at all - and there was also a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They were playing around with the idea of a more realistic corporate ad, but it was more of a stop-gap to emphasize the subject with bright colors and animation.
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture device being sold at fairs", says Tom Davies, Amnesty International.
Now the UK government must act to ensure that the sale of torture devices is not illegal near our homes.
Perhaps the most creative art in stationery comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors trade fantastically decorated products.
Saab disclosed in its press release that it had received an order from the US Army for an AT4CS RS launcher.
This includes a unique pipe-fighting device that makes excellent impact behind the armour into the target.
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student apartment at the age of 19, unknowingly, and I still believed in baret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember annoying the people's grin and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a condo can be anything that's going to get on your nerves, absolutely scary.
It's tempting to whisper: tell me where you're from, how you've been through the interim and where you're thinking about Corbyn, and why I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a baby.
Take your breath.
And also help others to breathe, ask questions, and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the people you don't want to talk to even if your eyelids are on fire and they're sharing the switches.
Give people space.
People's rooms often become cocktail parties, movie theaters, and public recreation spaces, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many homes have a culture of room-to-room walking that is friendly, social, and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to anyone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say I love you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can collect the energy I spent talking to you".
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking.
Knocking when the word comes: knock.
A guy at my student apartment thought if the door wasn't locked, he'd be invited in.
He saw a lot of stuff.
Make friends by baking.
Since you're starting college at the peak of your bakery trendium, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate bar and introducing yourself seems a little less weird, less welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions from a 50-something.
I mean, offering you a cold dessert is a great way to make friends.
Your roommate feels obliged to talk, and in the future they may associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, that depends on how you make bread.
The poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat mix is likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand that taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask the milk owner and check.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm gonna be sympathetic to you, but try to be more adult than my roommate who mixed a laundry detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You don't have to be so mean that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial spade blowing a bowl.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could play their drum and bass music lower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had her exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally stopped at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music to bed, locking her door, and leaving for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing to keep your housing partner as your future spouse, hit it off, break up, and then see him every day, and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate is not really your future spouse, you might as well try to make sense of it in your low voice.
In that exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys unlocked in their room, the line between cheating and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it can be cancelled in a second.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in a water bottle, then put them in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling with blue paint at most twice.
A racist attack on the home of foreign students in Kiteel - a house designed as a reception center was robbed in Salo
A racist attack on the home of foreign students was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Kerala.
Contrary to what police had previously said, these are not the dormitories of minors seeking asylum but rather dormitories for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitti Evangelisk National University.
The windows and walls of the public university dormitories were painted with racist markings, such as punches, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the dormitories, eastern Finnish police said.
According to Luukkainen, a responsible teacher in the youth social security training program at the National University of Georgia, an estimated ten people were in the building at the time of the attack.
"If it was a weekend and adults were free to move around, some might be elsewhere", says Luccainen.
The public school has 12 people from different nationalities.
They are already students in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors seeking asylum.
Everyone in this messed up building has a "A" status.
Some are in adult primary school, some are in vocational courses and some are studying Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a permanent residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in eastern Finland are investigating the attack as a result of damage and a breach of domestic law.
Luukkainen said that a press conference was held for the students on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twelve years, and this is the first time something like this has happened", says Luccainen.
According to Luukkain, the mess has already been cleared from the walls.
The suspects involved at least three men who were travelling in a white passenger car.
I think this is a weekend headline for the young man, when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that", says Luke.
Also in Salò, there is a poisoned hospital with a reception center.
The case happened last week.
MTV reported the incident on their website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted with a stick and the words "You are not welcome" were written in English.
The police have a criminal complaint.
Correction of the incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y-train to the Cattle... passengers on their knees, "really idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Cattle Station will stop running in March.
The news annoyed the passengers who boarded the train's opening night shift at the Helsinki main railway station.
"The downpour is particularly striking for the blessed", said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It's a very stupid country, because the population is growing all the time and those who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the video interview with HSTV that he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
There are also train changes in other parts of the New World.
The H and R trains running on the line shall be combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Lake Erie and the station of Nuppulinna in Tuusulas will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published on Tuesday information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase rail transport during the next contract period.
The contract period changes year-over-year and there are cancellation routes across the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee at a later date.
The Sicilian Bengtström considers the state railway system to be a short-sighted activity.
We're going to make the same mistakes we've made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you'll have regrets.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the Raziporis and the Besionians because it is fast and passes several stations.
Anina Pöyryä, from Espoo, was a train wreck that devastated the lives of those who traveled beyond the city.
"It's especially sad for those who have to re-planning their journey", he said, hurting the Y-train.
I'm gonna give you a little relief.
A new train is likely to arrive on the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Regional Transport Area (HSL), which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now looking into the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices", said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train about a million a year, certainly much more than that.
The R line coming to the edge of the bridge will miss two stations.
Instead, in the Solitaire and Sauna Lounges, the number of train rides will double.
The entire country has 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy rail services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The route from Piecieciec to Joensuu is shortened to Piecieciec Theft.
The train rides are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The Commission has already decided to extend the period of validity of the measures to be taken to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Currentness of Capital: "It Is Worth Getting to Know Marx"
The global economic crisis has brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his 1867-1894 masterpiece Capital to the surface, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former chairman of the SKP, in his book The Current of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in his opening remarks.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and increasing penetration of all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author's list of books based on the Capital seminars organised by Hake is also provided by Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is timely "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute for Life Research and the Commission for Life Research is not a Marxist, is he?
- No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a modern economist but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are diverse and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The common perception is that the history of the religion tells us about the wrong opinions of the dead men", begins Korkman.
It is true that Marx's predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the Industrial Revolution, he drew conclusions that went too far from the beginnings of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What was most relevant about Marx was that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're going to discuss topics of interest to Marx, like wealth distribution.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution", analyzed Korkman.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not a Marxist help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
But Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not read", says Korkman.
"The Maoists, the Trotskyists and the other factions all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and even Marx can be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the years ahead.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with the world of Marx's thought - like all other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war of 1983-09 came out Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebel groups known as the Tamil militiamen of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in the Sri Lankan civil war.
There's no exact number of victims.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation into the major military offensive in the final months of the long war in 2009, in particular.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely to be men as women.
The rebels have been charged with the forced entry of children and young people into the fighting.
Both sides have been charged with murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself but will not allow the establishment of the UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-test was a social media experiment.
In the fall school year, there was a long foreign language shift on Wednesday, mostly English.
He tested his English skills on over 16,000 students.
He could have written the test stuff on social media.
Based on personal experience, we had to consider whether social media made us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an article of 150 to 250 words in English could be pointed to the person holding the magazine's advisory board.
The title was "Dear Agony Aunt".
Agony Aunt is in charge of Lelia's Finnish restroom.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should view matters from the perspective of young ones.
There were four subjects in total, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them all", Mia Lybeck, an English teacher at Porvoo Swedish High School, said of the third subject.
The third item was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And Lybeck said the fourth was a nice one.
It was supposed to be a fireworks discourse about why companies should hire young people.
"At least our school has been practicing speech writing", says Lybeck, and he considers the whole experiment "normal".
The Finnish - or Swedish - English test was able to answer questions about texts that could help, for example, adapting the summer campaign to climate change and processing large volumes of data.
On Wednesday, some long-form Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn workshops continue on Friday, when the second national, Swedish or Finnish, is in session.
The examination is normally held in high schools, so it's not affected by the employees' expressions of mind.
The Higher Education Statistics Board urges the students to find the right connections in time to qualify for the test.
Additional time may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence.
In Oulu, the gun trade was looted with the threat of
Oulu was robbed Wednesday morning of a store in the Cello neighborhood.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face-covering command post.
He's a normal-looking man, about 30.
Police said the man threatened the staff with a handgun and was able to seize a small amount of money.
We're investigating a robbery that's gross.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki with supporting parties from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's decision to cut the city will be blocked in the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK associations will meet at 11:00 a.m. at the Railway Centre.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
On the other hand, the task of the police on duty is not only to carry out the alert and other police functions, but also to ensure the flow of the giant's message.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9:30 to 14:00.
We're only gonna let emergency vehicles into the area.
Traffic in the direction of Hakaneem will be cut off at the Kaisaniem traffic circle, westward from Mannerheim Field.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it seems like enough.
I'm not taking a stand on police work-related matters.
According to Kujalan, support groups from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki to protest.
The police are not giving us exact numbers.
"There is some progress coming, but we usually do it on our own", says Kujala.
Police are urging you to avoid private vehicles in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam will extend from the Hakaneem level to the core.
Traffic is expected to be stable from dawn to dusk.
Along with the other Finnish protesters, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed to go to the railway yard.
The buses are basically a long way off.
The final step is to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The airspace will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police standpoint, there's a positive side to this.
The problem of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings, is now partly solved.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policies may be arriving in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the protest to flow quietly.
The people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also being held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's mental expression is exceptional in many ways. Remember those strikes and mental expressions?
The large demonstration organized by trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not much comparison in Finnish political history", says Martti Siiseninen, professor emeritus of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
No wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says Siysienne.
The far-right government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's strict grip on contract law is lacking.
There are many features to the fact that the ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
And the ay movement has a mirror-watching spot.
For example, the need for mirrors is due to the fact that the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's expressions of mind.
What is new is the sharp division that the expression of opinion creates among the group that the Ay movement would like to participate in the protest.
The unemployed from all over Finland showed their support in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If you look for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be the massive demonstration of unemployment, organized in 1993 by Murrostorstai, says Siiseninen.
The Murrostorst, organized in the middle of the deepest depression, gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The First Ahon (Central) Government is moving from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earners' organizations had never been worse than under the Ahon bourgeois government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than they were in Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now the most bourgeois government in Finland ever, Siysienne says.
The current coalition is still interesting in that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the comments of fundamentalists.
In the early days, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
The expression of opinion will also stop public transport and possibly close day care homes and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the undivided support of the employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been organized in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Ay movement's protests in Finland have been relatively peaceful, although the practices have intensified in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finland, protests are avoided by conflict, and we obey the law.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisena says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs, and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The fire strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also apparent strikes by pilots and flight attendants.
Remember these strikes and protests?
1970s metal and electrical alloys
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the 1971 metal strike and the 1977 power and electricity strike.
The strike was attended by 70,000 metalworkers.
The strike was suspended on the recommendation of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The metal guys got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, a power outage lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
The first of these was the first of the three.
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in the House to express their views on work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998.
The fire strike was one of the shortest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the egg rain in 1994 when farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers of Espalle were snowing tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also urged farmers to protest and burn flour pellets in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marred by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and gang-rap the nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass exchanges has accelerated the negotiations to a final result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced to leave", was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The five-month strike by local health centres and hospital doctors sparked a lively debate about the risks to patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5,000 students marched for scholarships from the Senate building in Helsinki to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Crime Police are investigating the background of a Finnish refugee camp for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee camp registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly en route to Finland.
Everyone on the cold-blooded ride was fine.
We've had a briefing with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main investigation are at the scene in Austria, says the Central Crime Police Chief Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, the fate of other refugees in Austria who travelled in lorries was more tragic.
All 71 passengers on board died of suffocation.
According to the first Austrian police officer, who reported the cooperation, the truck belongs to a Finnish joint stock company.
The company operates restaurants and its CEO is a foreigner, aged about 40.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
Captain, former drug lord, and rebellious businessman, who beat up refugees.
A drunken smuggler king, a violent Russian, a stylish missionary and a self-described good-natured cab driver.
For example, such people are trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, who work at Trenton University, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency is coming out in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the dangers of human trafficking, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS is introducing five of them.
I 'll beat their asses right off .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for summer vacations.
The islands are also well suited for smuggling, since the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives the Emir, a chained burning captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable at transporting people.
The Emir has done it hundreds of times with his blue, 10-meter wooden boat.
If the boat is fully enclosed, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis began again.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the Kerkenna Islands.
The Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is delivered in such a way that the customers are kept alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the client runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight, the shortest we've ever been.
The first night we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves up to 20 meters high, the passengers cry and vomit.
The human nakedness at the destination has been stripped in half an hour and Emir is leaving for his return journey.
The Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least claims to be beating up the hangers to death.
He tells the book that when the police caught up with him once, he threw all his passengers over the deck and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them across the bar", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the southern Sahara.
He says his fellow citizens must be abusing him for this.
I'll just knock their heads off.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cabbie .
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter motor is dragging its last, and by the way, it's had its best days.
But what matters most to Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which mainly allows families to leave.
In the forests surrounding the city, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, which everyone has now found or built.
The forest also includes families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some of them are also housed in private residences, but it's a public secret.
Among the forest people, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and week-long walks in rough terrain, often mountainous and dark.
When they finally arrive in Bogova region, the hub of a major human trafficking, people are dying tired.
The Goran passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough", Goran compliments.
He says Africans are trying to get away with it.
That's not what Goran likes.
A foolish fool goes all the way.
First, they agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they cut it down to 200 and finally they offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice, good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", she says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a trip to the Hungarian border.
It's a three hundred kilometers, mostly comfortable highways.
I hear your colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran makes about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the paths, and he takes his passengers a mile across the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and he's gonna throw it away.
The Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many Congolese refugees attend, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that transports people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the white-collared rubber band looks elegantly under the low waistline of her hips.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the Broadcasting Mission.
He advises that you arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money quietly, and mingle with traders crossing the border.
To obtain asylum seekers or refugees, the Ugandan authorities must inform them that they are from war zones, such as North Kivu, and that they have fled violence in their homes.
Often, that's true, but if it isn't, the Missionary will provide the client with a new identity.
The old ID will be destroyed and replaced with a new one.
That's where the contacts of the missionary in the Ugandan police will help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum process, to NGOs, and finally to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges a fee of about EUR 100 for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation, about EUR 150, and moving to a European country, for example, for EUR 4 500 to 7 000.
Folies and ice cream
Tom is a bootlegger, a former drug trafficker.
A 40-year-old Irishman lives on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks en route to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the cabbie picked up their customers, usually two or three people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving down the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be jailed for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highways to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing down the canal to Brittany.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's heading to England, not Holland, and cuts through the safety barrier.
It's a quiet thing to do, or the driver wakes up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the deal is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom turns his client into an aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a toast or a oven pan in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police from detecting the hologram of the hologram.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he doesn't drive a sudden greasepaint, at least not until Britain.
The King of Secretaries
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The talented Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who rules the sea route from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands money when he gets there.
One new method is luxury boat fraud: Turkish ports are rented as a pleasure cruise to take American or European families on comfortable, few-day tourist trips.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported first from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5,000 to 7,000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until they are ready to leave.
People are locked up in minibuses and driven to shore.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once we've given it, we'll have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the cover for the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe the depth of the ship, since no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the fewer passengers who vomit and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about EUR 53,000 for one luxury boat trip after the costs.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller agents to handle the work for him.
In the summer, at least hundreds of transportation are arranged and Küçük makes millions.
He estimates he's buying through undercover companies land, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he's apparently gone missing.
Amendment of 16 September 2015 at 3:10 pm: Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells of his illness and prostitution in his book
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book, Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published snippets of the book Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in his best form and ran the race for second best time.
But in the final, she panicked.
He rushed to the top right away and defended his lead in the race.
But 150 meters before the painting, his powers were over.
He crashed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressures to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was attracted to the idea of making money by having sex with strangers.
She also over-talked her husband to accept her actions.
The Favor Hamilton fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he craved the same adrenaline rushes he had when competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton learned that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed at the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world record holder in the 1500 meters with a time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
World champion cheered when the League disciplined Norwegian skiers, "Right-tailed"
Norway's ski king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of fitness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been turning their sports contract down, as they did last summer and autumn.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation has decided to withdraw from the World Cup next season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union had the ski club.
"Thank you for your support", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsorship of the union", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northugh is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be a part of the national team for the season so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also look after future generations and not allow one athlete to stand alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had granted Northug economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he's the best.
Northug issued his own statement on Tuesday, saying he wanted to wear Norwegian at the next World Cup, as well as the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen has won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two golds.
He was on the team that won the gold medal last winter at Falun.
The Day of the Translators is also celebrated in the North
On 25 September, the festival will be held in restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Shrimp's Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of knowledge in the food industry and to lower the barrier to going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of shielding as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is worth recalling that not all high-end restaurants are concentrated in the capital, but that top restaurants, which are inspected and rated by an impartial operator, are found throughout Finland.
The international attention it receives is a testament to the importance of the event as part of raising awareness of the event's competitors and the organisation.
In the Nordic countries, the day is organized at the Vaasa restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks.
The cooking is taking place at the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
The decision was made to make it one of the most important international events of the Organization, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has decided to grant the Council a special opinion on the draft directive.
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the former Kauhava barracks now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a crisis-critical infrastructure which is permanently in use by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finnish Erillisnetkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki, the private individual believes that the location of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant said the defence forces may have interests in the former air force school and its airport, the impact of which has not yet been explored in the preparation of the reception centre.
The Commission notes that the airport operator's activities in the airport are not related to the airport's activities.
The matter was discussed with Minister of Defence, Mr Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Minister of Defence, Mr Arto Rady.
The individual states to the legal counsel that the complaint is not a matter of a principle opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former equipment area is wrong.
The terrible city council was dealing with the reception center issue last Monday.
True: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö said in a statement to reporters after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniem.
The President said that concern about the management of the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He believes that the political and political parties in Finland can discuss the most fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially at a time when we face great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could thus also have an impact on Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a new directive.
If that develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continued tension in the Baltic Sea.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the draft budget.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, and you'll be closed for a couple of hours.
One flight is already cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on the Finnair website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to operate airports with a commander-in-chief's force during the work stoppage.
However, traffic and delays are expected at security inspections and other service points.
The demonstration is closing down the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the road to the railway station will be closed to vehicles at approximately 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The Mannerheim mission will not allow cars to enter the mine, post and work bays towards the railway station.
From Union Road Hakaniem traffic shall be diverted to Union Road at the Kaisaniem traffic circle.
Police say the shutdown time depends on the number of protesters.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and railroad buses all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will participate in a demonstration on Friday morning from morning traffic to night traffic.
The union of radio and subway personnel told STT about this tonight.
Most of the Alkoho closes for two hours, including post offices closed.
Friday's mood swings are also causing disruption to Post's services.
Significant delays are expected, including for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the mail service points are closed.
Blood shipments of the Finnish Red Cross are being handled despite the strike.
The aim is to handle food shipments, hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
The information on the services can be obtained from the Post's website.
Most Finnish Alkohouses close their doors for two hours on Fridays.
The service industry union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on day-to-day merchants to participate in the expression of opinion of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko inform Helsingin Sanom that the stores will be kept open by the superintendent if necessary.
Kesko said there was no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
The Helsinki daycare centre is partially closed
The Helsinki daycare centre is not fully functioning on Friday, the Helsinki Early Education Agency reports.
The main reasons for this are that the daycare is concentrated on certain day schools, and that club activities are not organised in day schools and playgrounds.
Day care centres and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities for children with developmental disabilities and autistic children are normally organised.
The Early Childhood Education Agency will be announcing further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: The spider takes a big risk
According to Sibila, communication requires a variety of channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one of the channels.
This is the kind of direct communication we will need in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Mr Sipil was not yet prepared to assess how often the prime minister's television and radio speeches are repeated.
According to Sipela, the speeches may not always be transmitted through the Yle channels in the future.
If any other channels sign up, we'll see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sibila, the Finnish economy is in such serious condition that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
This whole issue is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipil said.
The talk will be broadcast at 9.05pm and 21.20pm on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yle Arena.
The Apple is taking a big risk
A media analyst hopes that Sipila's television speech will not tell of a more general government inward turn.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse to question the settings of public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of the democratic debate and the public, I hope these things are not connected.
I'm sorry to hear that the commercial media has been upset by Sipila's announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision makers are not a matter of communication in a democracy.
The role of the media is to make sure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivus says that the TV talk is a big risk for Sipila.
The speaker should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations.
Is there anything more to offer today than what we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in a different word, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only one more of the same old one in the permit, one must wonder why such a big move was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
One takes the risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the YLE will be labeled as a message by politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in YLE's interests or general line.
A smart bet from a peach
In the next speech, the prime minister's omission is also important, the media analyst stresses.
"Tonight, we need to look closely at what Sipila is missing and what he is not", says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jvaskyla.
I heard that the TV talk is a clever appeal from Sipila, because this is how he gets to present his own views without any noise.
This will give a broad audience a message without a journalist filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The spider is going to go beyond the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media may misinterpret the speech because it will not allow accurate questions to be asked.
I heard it was very important how Silvia was on TV, how she was sweating, how her hands were shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can play it right, it can work.
It's different than when the government announces something, because here, it's like a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his associates do regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be very exceptional.
He said that the Prime Minister has not spoken directly to the people in decades.
"Exceptional times require exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher estimates that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
The payroll organizations are holding a protest and strike on Friday against the government's actions.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that Sipila could make his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion.
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne (S), announced his challenge to the dialogue with Mr Sipila.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who was on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish police department also confirmed the incident to the Evening Post.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that evening, he was never contacted again.
Dad's thanking everyone who helped me find him.
Thank you for all the ten contacts and observations you've made during these hours.
The update was split closer to 15,000 times , which is an incredible balance in such a short time .
Finnish UFC star disappointed in youth violence:
Kurdish-born freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook appealing especially to immigrant-born youth.
Makwan Amirkhani was making a powerful speech against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and brought to Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There's been a video uploaded to the account showing young people fighting in the most violent way.
My wife says she's disappointed in the youngsters' wildness.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick people down, sit on each other and hit them with your eyes open, without even thinking about the consequences of making these videos, Amirkhani said.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people in the videos are immigrant-oriented.
According to Jarmo Heinosen, police commissioner in Helsinki, the video of the fight has been uploaded to social media by immigrants and young people from Kantan Finland.
It's called fighting on the street.
You are making life more difficult than many other immigrants here in Finland, says the turquoise Amirkhani.
Amirkhani reminds you that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot of rough stuff.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
My office urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get the target of some kind of racism, you might blame yourself.
Now, you guys think twice before you go into something like that.
My Amirkhani says that violent activity contributes to racism.
You're making a lot of hate in the dark, which I don't like.
You're going through a rough patch anyway, and that spending won't make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges to take its position in the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employer organisation was considering its position on the alternative savings scheme proposed by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Centre for Personnel Management (STTK) said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, this would require the largest employer organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented briefly on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK working committee will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is seeking solutions to 'open up the labour market' and that contracts signed by active parties are needed to replace mandatory laws.
Lyly points out that the proposal for a collective bargaining agreement by the government of Prime Minister Sipila was not appropriate for SAK.
Sibiu has previously suspended negotiations on the joint venture agreement when SAK failed to commit to the 5% productivity allocation target.
Comment: The big-minded demonstration threatens to go viral. "I feel a little weird about punching".
I feel a little weird about fighting a fight if you already have a paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies in the pay camps from the edge to the bottom.
Is it to call a government shutdown or do we have to agree?
On Monday, the SAK's leaders unleashed a holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The fear would spread to the wild.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or day care facilities will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, the President of the Centre for Personnel, STTK, Antti Palola (sd), made a pleasant appearance.
He said he had contacted the government and had prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity rate, which Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) demanded.
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder (co-founder), hastened to announce immediately that his paperwork had been completed.
The SAK office didn't hear from the yard at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is having a hard time agreeing with the union leaders who just on Monday ordered a ceasefire on Friday.
However, Lyly finally stated that the SAK Working Committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to 'open up the labour market'.
In order to create a common employee picture, the SAK should be inclined to adopt a productivity target of 5%.
No wonder the Palladian STTK has good relations with the Sibilla government.
Palla's right-hand man, the STTK's social impact director, Jukka Ihanus, previously served as special assistant to the central government prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniem.
Mr Palola also described the government's ability to improve its skills as a whole.
It is a coincidence that the outcome of the Palola took a little cleaning away from the Finnish stand-up comedians, whose bowling figures are the AKT's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I feel a little weird about fighting a fight when you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m. Added information about Lyla's comments.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the Helsinki Conference of the European Commission.
The Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better host of the EEC than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, the monthly session of the Etyji Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians like Naryshkin who were on the EU's ban list to attend the meeting - a fact the President managed to remind reporters about.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin pressed, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin was criticized for his entry into the United States, where he was also banned.
Sanctions are political suicide in the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia was not successful, so Naryshkin continued to praise Finland and thank Mongolia for its "exceptional organization".
I am sure that the General Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (co) who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator and has already discussed the matter with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock is facing a real playoff kick: "Paints tight".
Tappara and Luke are going to continue the Bull Days in the Hakeam Forest today, with both on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in the Hakam Forest, there will be no real painting party.
Tappara was in Copiah yesterday, picking up a 3-to-2 win over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, because last season's silver team was at its worst of two points.
Tuesday was the closing day.
The Blues, who started the Rafale game with a sneak peek, had a round zero point, and a losing streak of 2-3.
A tough game, tight paints, if anyone plays the same game as last year, Lock Attacker Janne Lahti predicted settings on the sidelines.
The Matarras have become a playoff nightmare for the Rumaans.
Tappara has been in the middle of the final two seasons of the season.
Both times, the final seven games are required.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a close in the fourth game, but Tappara went up and past the next three.
The group composition has not changed significantly except for the goalkeepers.
The two cash registers who were rejected yesterday will be paid a cheat today.
With the Tappara goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock-up tiles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsky.
The scene: A terrible play in progress
Sports director Toivola wrote the script for the sequel, which is not compatible with the Iron Ball, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for Rocky, which he himself starred in.
The recorder made a sensational gesture to the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky was very well liked, even though he lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote the script for the restless ashtray story of Pori.
An unnamed and unstable stabbed man went to the 2006 SM finals to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of unnamed but stubborn underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Porin Matt and Pele from Peltos.
In the knockout games, players would color their heads red and cut their iroses.
I was hoping for a blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The donkey took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the innovation of this season is working the same way it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a donkey sports manager has built a potato farm for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in the backyard like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The credit of Masi Marjam, Mikko Viitas, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparise is somewhere other than in the game of hockey.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI is about the lead role of the Iron Curtain.
Carrie Stone has been crowned Iron Man Sean Connery.
Iron Curtain is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original 1976 production of Toivola's Rocky.
There's nothing in the train except Rocky's nickname.
The philosophy of the game is not to run and play.
He appreciates hardball, but it's different to play hardball than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Eagles beat Tappara's River from the head to the head.
He got two minutes and 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Curtain put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don't approve of that game, and it's not part of the game of ace, because the hot-tempered Iron Man got angry after the game against the People of the Century.
The team this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and scouts.
There's practically no key players in the best gaming age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the talent.
How much influence have you been able to have on player acquisitions, Iron Curtain?
The recent events have affected purchases and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, said Rautakallio diplomatically.
It's under the surface.
The 1953 model year, the Iron Curtain, is known to be interested in moving to Toivola for a sports holiday.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The score for the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses by a score of 1-6.
I don't think it would have been worthwhile for Desola to write the sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing Sipe Santapuk's mother.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is performing for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the movie as the mother of my husband's friend.
It's kind of crazy, but the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former Apuliana bassist and director Tuukka Temes since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting for the first time under the direction of Tuuk.
The role of Olga in the movie You Made Us Beautiful, which tells the story of the early years of Apulan, is that of the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Circa.
The circus is thumping and supporting its son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my real role of the circus, the easier it feels to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuck for trusting me to do the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have grown very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The circus has been a big help.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
And fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is drama and that the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only band in Heinola who blindly believed that Aulanna would become Finland's biggest band.
The '90s were a lot of lazy, and it was really miserable.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirca had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard much about Tuuka's youth before the film was made.
But the stories of the parents have been a little different from time to time.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you're talking about?
Olga reveals that her own youth was quite different from that of the notorious skater, Tuuk, of Heinolan.
Olga was a simple, kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie "The Twilight".
At best, she could have secretly been in love.
According to Olga, he's worked so much with Tuuka in the last 10 years that he's not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always been super-good.
Now the entire production team is going to film for a month in Heinola.
Of course, the couple living in Istria often plans to drive home for their young children, often overnight, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole of Heinolan for a month.
They've been very warm to us, asking just which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film ever made
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Moorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to begin filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is set to become the most expensive Finnish drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive Finnish film was Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation is also set to rise above Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma, will begin filming in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will run for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The budget's not scary.
I've been sick and tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in your ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to get this movie out there for the public to see", he tells Evening Post.
The original budget for the film was $8 million to $8 million, but as the script progressed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big store.
But the film could get 100 million dollars because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tightly twisted that there's not a single loose one.
Film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond loan on Wednesday, paying an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final rate shall be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will pay back the loan in two years' time.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
A bunch or a cool one?
Big logos are back on shirts.
The trendsetter's fronts have recently been decorated with large logos.
A while back, a fashion-savvy dresser avoided the big, clear logos like Crocs and Consanas.
Advertising a pair of shoes or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a joke.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, well-known sports brands like Adidas and Nike, rising to the brink of coolness.
And as so often as ever, the funny and trendy boundary is a daunting one: if something is already a good thing, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, a trendsetter's surprise by choosing the most boring basic clothes as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Instead of the gray basic college, we're going to put on the webbed buried at the bottom of the cupboard, with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' recognizable track and field teams, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees tickets have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logo, the one with the first-hand look on the edge of the fork, is a cool detail.
It seems that the trend is shifting from sports to luxury brands.
For example, the Versace jacket brush is a clear indication of what a signature dress is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dressing?
The Russian politician published evidence that I was not trapped in a tank trap for hours!
The Commission also concluded that the Russian Arms Expo 2015 was a special event in Nizhni Tagil.
In recent days, Russian media have been making colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Affairs had to remove the large Zotov from the tank shell for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peering through the hull of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood and at least not from the pictures of any trapped or angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the tank. It was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, a lieutenant colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around, and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komosomolska Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov told the Russian army's TV channel that he was fascinated by the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I loved our technology.
And I came out through the back of the car, he said.
I've been to every tank.
And at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit every tank and every tank, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One idiot wrote it, and everyone else did it.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and short, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened", he told Russian sluzhba novotei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged trapped have been published, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people attended the exhibition over the course of a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's trappedness was initially reported on a Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told by his rims of a tank shaft as he tried to get out and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he did not get off the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers shared their own views on the event.
Everybody's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours", said Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition coordinator, to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite of the decorating bloggers.
The 1962 pencil by architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it were designed today.
A lunar-colored steel shell is like a work of art, and that's what it was in the beginning.
Architects are known for their long-standing pencil shape and their mathematical precision.
It was initially only presented to the gentlemen's dignified dinner guests.
The cubes are made by the family-owned By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
The cup is black and white, and nickel and copper are available.
The brush is up-to-date right now and is suitable for a wide variety of homes.

The trade union demonstration will take place at Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11 a.m. and 13 p.m., but the strike will affect the lives of citizens for much longer - for 24 hours and even beyond.
ISTV has 10 points to determine how Friday's storm affects citizens.
Watch the video of the impact of the traffic jams on road and rail transport, both in terms of cargo and passenger transport.

What about schools and day care?
Police and fire?
The food stalls, the Alkot and the mail car, not to mention the factories and the harbor?
The details of the strike information may be changed by Friday.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine in Finland, owned by the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle.
The refined process water from the gold mine has leaked out of the so-called "rich-pools" into the well.
The company said that measures to rectify the leak have been initiated.
The pool has a neutral enrichment area and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or is discharged into the environment through a surface treatment area as authorised.
The estimated flow was about 300 cubic metres per hour when detected.
The company said the quality of the leakage water meets the current licensing requirements.
Nothing else was leaking into the environment.
The leak was detected during a check-up on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the water supply structures has been observed.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about 600 permanent workers.
Danish banker: IMF warns against cutting too much
The IMF's report on the financial situation in Finland, published today by the International Monetary Fund, largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation encouraged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime and paid vacations would support Finland's competitiveness.
The whole contract system and the unemployment insurance system would need to be reformed.
According to Danske Bank chief economist Pasi Kuoppamaen, the structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of message of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case for infrastructure investments, Mr Kooppamäki told the Economic Report.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts that Finland will grow by 0.4% this year, and will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicted that growth would remain zero this year in its new relationship forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest observations.
This morning, the Statistical Office reported that the total production was at a low growth rate in the summer, says Kooppamäki.
The weakening of industry confidence or other so-called softer measures have received less attention.
However, the differences are only a few percentage decimal places.
Nintendo, recovering from death, has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata was the head of Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching the successful Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishima's choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were being raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo to mobile games in a big way, but not to eat the company's bread on traditional gaming consoles.
More and more asylum seekers are arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in Sweden disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year, according to the SVT and Dagens Nyheter websites.
The inspector general of the Immigration Agency, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is Finland in the same situation?
How many asylum seekers disappear "underground" per year? - In Finland, a total of 156 asylum seekers who arrived alone in 2013 were made.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 such applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa said.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is established at the hearing that the applicant is already registered in another Dublin Regulation country and may have been declared an adult there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attracted to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
A similar proportion of the missing are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, out of which 134 applications were decided to be disqualified because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
By September 6, this year, we have received a total of 586 single-entry asylum applications from minors.
The overall statistics on missing asylum seekers are not yet available, but the number of asylum seekers is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been convicted?
Is it also going to "black labor markets"?
The Commission has not yet decided whether to approve the decision.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Soc) has expressed concern about the growing number of unregistered country seekers.
He's taken action on the case.
At the EU's interior ministers' meeting on refugee issues, Orpo spoke on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. 's studio online . Watch the photos on the equipment .
The equipment used by media journalist Timo T.A. Mikko for his television and radio productions, who lost his job due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkos's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net, which at one time was the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The first online newsletter to report the online announcement was Nightcatcher.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind by technological advances.
In the digital media world, no more television shows are filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interested ones.
The hardware is not as modern as it is today, of course, but it is needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans, collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen, who thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is because the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current home in the Storm.
We can't take all the stuff we have with us.
I've been slowly inventing and looking at what stuff to give away.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
From the traces of recent strokes, it's clear that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that we're only selling merchandise and equipment now.
In the summer, Timo T.A. Mikkos's real life work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives visited the box office to pick up films and other material from Myrsky.
Traffic is threatened with a worse-than-expected gridlock: Metro and tram could stop all Friday
The drivers of the subway and the tram will decide today whether to extend their efforts to demonstrate on Friday.
The original plan was to halt subway and tram traffic only for the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, we'll decide if traffic stops for the day.
Chief of the Trust, Pekka Hirvonen, says the threat is high on the ground.
Night and day operations are a major irritant to drivers, and the government's plans to cut the lice are facing opposition.
But the monster thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area will be almost completely stopped.
According to the VR, trains do not run between the hours of morning and evening on Fridays.
Friday's free of near and far traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be taken to the station.
HSL says most of the buses are stuck in the parking lot.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday mornings from 3am to 3am on Saturday mornings.
It is likely that a small number of buses will be able to be operated, they will be operated by commander-in-chief, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus routes will run on Friday.
The employers' organisations are organising a big protest at Helsinki Railway Centre on Friday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident happened on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News reports that the refugees have attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would have also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas . A teacher thought his watch was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher held a homemade watch he had brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his income from his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended when the boy was taken in handcuffs to the youth's detention cell.
Muhammad has never been found to have claimed anything other than to have made a watch.
Still, it's possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The case happened last Monday and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of forced schooling.
Her father is furious about the case, and the country's American Muslim Council is considering whether the case is yet another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is on the verge of a breakdown . Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem .
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, Labour's representative Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service honored the battle of the British Air Force against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Mr Corbyn in its official statement and stresses that he showed respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in immense debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement noted.
The election of Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Members of Parliament in particular are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity and increased public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to make his first appearance as leader of the party in Parliament today at the prime minister's prime time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should be asked.
Cameron tweeted this week about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the prime minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family death remains unclear. The family's father was awaiting trial.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family homicide in Greenwood, Minnesota, for the past week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with his first shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house to inspect it and found the Shorts dead in a huge house all over the place.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Millionaire and a Successful Business
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work remains unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur who had created his fortune on a social media site dedicated to nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors a week.
I've been asked about 50 offers for the company over the last 10 years.
I've given up all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company sometime, but not yet.
Among other things, Short's family bought a vacant house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the Zillowice real estate website as a collector's dream: not only do the house have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage for eight cars.
The case is pending .
But according to the Star Tribune, the family's father was awaiting trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offered various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the Short website did not remove comments that were offensive to the Prep courses and, as a result, they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered us some cupcakes.
In addition, the owner's third was awarded the Finnish Hippo of the Month Horse Owner Award for feeding.
This is great. Loiri commented on her honorary table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and earned a prize of €100,000.
The artist legend Loiri was still baffled by the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Prix.
I still don't think it happened.
The winning horse trainer Korpi is accompanied by Loir, who enjoys complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
The horse is the one who decides where to race.
And I'm going to hold my ass, Loiri bitch.
The most amazing gesture of an NHL star, "the greatest gift of any athlete ever".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's press release, this is the largest single donation to charity by an athlete in Canada.
Subban, 26, has also pledged to help the hospital with other fundraising efforts over the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his annual share of $9 million.
As a reward for his contributions, Subban will receive a hall named after him from the hospital.
Canadiens players have already made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scan needed for cancer research.
You can order a Japanese coffee for your wife 's dinner . They only serve food in bikinis and a donkey on top .
I mean, tea cabbage is a tough thing in Japan.
There's a goat shop, a chicken shop, a vampire shop, a hawk shop, and now a bridal shop.
It hits lonely, uncomfortable, hungry people.
The Metro reported it.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the grid: Arming for attacks on car security
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the industry, according to a press release from Intel.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing security tests and reviews to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of its cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future on the basis of the results of the ASRB investigation.
The Commission has also examined the potential for the use of the new technologies in the field of transport and the use of the new technologies.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60 to 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve car cybersecurity, says Intel Security CEO Chris Young.
The ASRB enables Intel to consolidate best security practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of any connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been expected for years like the moon rises.
Finally, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the automotive world is watching the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-cylinder RS is powered by a 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine that accelerates from zero to 100 mph in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, with a preliminary estimate of EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for purchase, although Ford will not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show , the popular Kia brand introduced two new features - the new Sportage and the Optima .
Of the two Finnish innovations, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important, with which Kia intends to take a bigger lead in the ever-growing street-to-door market.
The new Sportage, designed by European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round.
The axis and the outer edges have moved one inch from here to here, and the car is breaking through the air more efficiently.
The engine range remains largely the same, but it has been supplemented by a 1.6-litre turbocharged V8 engine with 177 horsepower.
More on Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is reported as sales revenue.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we're getting a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, we'd have the new Kia Optimas.
At first glance, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
The Optimus will be equipped with a 1.7-litre turbocharged diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT comes alongside them, equipped with a 2.0-liter turbo engine.
At the same time as it comes, the Optima Farmer goes on sale.
Chisu returned to the lagoon, and exploded in a brave, unarmed gallows.
Singer Chisu is in the Life for a Child concert with other local stars.
The electric blue pants have a nice, open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful representation of the singer's belt of a scissor.
The crown of the whole is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to curb her pregnant bodies with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter's about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
I'm not really excited about going back to the lawns and standing up to a big audience after a long break.
"I've missed everything about music", says the singer.
Chisu is releasing a new album in a couple of weeks and her fourth album, Polaris.
Your new state of life has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu is wondering.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is stunning again. Now you can see her breasts.
The reality show beauty Kim Kardashian is giving one conversation after another.
She's presenting her pregnancy and breastfeeding in a sexy dress, last night at 1:00 a.m. American time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It exposes the skinny breastplate underneath the dress in flash of lightning.
The last time Kardashian wore a professional maternity suit was when she went to a friend's house for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The black super-generation shoes were the highlight of the outfit.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday when the show was about to begin.
The strict rules of the fashion world: No home, lonely, competition terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted a short-term idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out about pure fashion.
Harpeer's Bazaar has put together six hard truths from Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you'd been posing in the costumes of some of the top designers last season, the new season will start again with casting.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces coming into the industry competing for jobs with conquerors.
I mean, models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it can take years for a hotel room or apartment to accommodate models.
If you are too young and your mother cannot accompany you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they're the most stressful of them all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and they act as a support network.
When fashion week ends, the difference is blurred.
Models want to go into this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they're annoyed that everyone thinks the job is just a showcase for clothes.
Models want to be their own people.
The work makes models feel like they're actors with roles.
But the model's job can also express itself.
You were a model at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York City is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers unveil their next year's models.
Roope Salminen , who changed his style , plays the most unknown piece of music in the movie
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the Apuliana group.
Lautala founded Apuliana in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but left the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rapper about to turn 26, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen, laughing.
I've never wanted to meet the real Ant before the shoot, because I want to make my own interpretation of her.
And Antti is obviously unfamiliar to those people, so I think it's a good idea that I learn her playing style from the video.
I don't want to do a human imitation.
A man who trusts the Roope Salmen and the Dogs union for nothing is not the source of the role.
Punk manners are a man's nature.
I'm sure many of you who've ever been to our shows in the punk era of "Stars, Stars" will have seen the premiere.
Our performance has never been anything small-time, but we always go full-time.
The cast of the film You Made Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temes, who played bass as an assistant from 1993 to 2004, was announced today.
The core of the band, familiar to the public, is a group of young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Blue House and bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about her upcoming wedding as early as last night when she revealed on Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the biggest day of her career.
Roope posted a photo of her new look on Instagram yesterday that she had to make for a movie.
Roope, who was previously seen with a mustache and a leather beard, has been wearing eyelashes and has dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell their child about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it?
There is no need to force the issue, advises SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Younger children should be protected, not allowed to watch the news alone, for example.
Little children may not always understand what they see, and it can be distracting and distressing, she says.
However, if a child has seen or heard news on television about refugees, it is worth talking about.
It is good to start the conversation with the child's point of view and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You can't scare a child for nothing, even if it's a pain in the ass and a scare.
A younger child closely follows his parents' behavior.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussion about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents should discuss matters with them if the child is thinking about them.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and children can discuss how our family is responding to this.
But do we think the world is a safe place after all?
Parents may also have different educational views - some of whom may want to protect their children from stress as much as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also discusses difficult matters, the child will be given an example of how to deal with the challenges of life ahead.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
The Vermont strikes the ball field hard to control
The North Pole was hit by a car in the middle of the autumn.
It only fed on the profits and the second-place finishers until the end of July, when the Tampere rave collapsed.
Because the animal had slipped to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protection from a veterinarian.
The explanation for the blackout came out in the blink of an eye.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two doses of medicine to suppress it.
Since the Apilla Ballosalama had to be lightly trained, Pohjola says he was positively surprised by the horse's final run.
It was the second SE-dams in the market at its peak after Tartuul.
The Apella Ball Slam was under great pressure at the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The slight tendency to take these things into account at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the Orioles sharp.
The horse's turn must have gone on from there, and I hope it was even.
The Appalachian Trail has been called the "Humor Horse".
If it's not fun, it could have gotten fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, slaves have been freed from such a slave trade that their opponents have been amazed.
At high speed, competitors cannot handle the Ballroom, which even warm-blooded rides take off.
The wishes of the North are a steak race in Vermo.
But the difference is how the Apple Ballroom will agree.
It's kind of hard to get out of here, and you can even put a knife under the top of the van and stuff like that.
I hope the slave is calmer now than when Turu leaves.
The Apella Ballgame can come out of the cage in good shape, and we're gonna go for a win, Coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps.
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhone may be removed in the future, but not all.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed.
There are a number of apps on Apple's iPhone that relatively few people use, such as FaceTime calls, News Feed, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tink.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory update to iPhone phones, although it is only needed by Apple Watch owners.
Cook says removing Apple's software is a lot more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to something on another iPhone.
If they're removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps worked well with the other apps.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company doesn't want to waste memory on users' iPhones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the decline in energy prices.
Eurostat revised its 0.2% forecast slightly downwards a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
The Eurostat forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
Average inflation in the EU was zero in August across the 28 countries.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
The highest level of consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4%, rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was at its lowest, with prices falling by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area's inflation rate remains firmly far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a 2% price rise in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
The growth rate will increase to 1.1% next year, as the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy next .
The next US recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years of the Fed's long-term interest rate hikes.
And the financial markets are going to be down before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession could hit its fastest by next autumn and the financial market will be heading in the direction of that.
Or at least that's what's going to happen if the world's biggest economies and financial markets are functioning as they have always been and if they're responding to the Fed's tightening of the money supply as they've done before.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to address the situation in the Union.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who wrote the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will raise interest rates or what will happen to the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations of financial statements to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous interest rates - and what the potential consequences are.
Clearly, both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to withstand interest rate increases than at any time since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession , maybe not a year .
The leaders of the Fed's monetary policy and its costly reform have been hinting since last summer and early in the year that the time has come for a ripe rate hike.
The first surge in more than nine years could happen this week.
The matter will be resolved within the next Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed's Executive Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds rate was in June 2006.
The Fed's two-year series of relatively regular but low interest rates of 0.25 percentage points ended with a rate increase from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market began to sink in 2007 with the difficulties of the most high-risk housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the severe reversals in the financial markets and the real economy started slower than they have typically been since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and harsh than ever before the 1930's depression.
Deutschen strategists have been scanning the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the financial market since 1950 and at various points since the early 19th century.
They've been making sense of the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
The first round of the Census has been the fastest since the start of the recession, with less than a year, usually less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market price rise has ended within a year or two of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has raised and lowered its interest rates in turn since the early 1950s, at the rate of a dozen different cycles.
Each time has diverged from the others in some respects and the times are relatively small, so that it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions on the effects of subsequent interest increases.
The strategies remind us that this time, a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
You 're taking too much interest .
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not be undeniably revealed even after decades of investigation.
But three things about the crisis and the reasons for its devastating effects are probably somewhat indisputable:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world's largest central banks kept their central rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were repairing the traces of the tech couple while growing the next one.
2) The debt accumulated over decades in various sectors of the financial and real economy, and which has already been too large, has been exacerbated by the influence of monetary policy over-investment by central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history since then.
3) In particular, the debt financing crisis, which was almost a long-term one for the financial economy, has inflated the largest price pairs in the financial history of most financial markets, from stocks to real estate, debts and commodities.
It is hardly a hard question to argue that the financial markets, which have risen to higher levels under increasingly complex debt conditions, were rarely in a dangerous and unstable position when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures adjusted for debt relief did not last until after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realized in the form of a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutschen strategists do not predict what will happen next, but they give a point of reference by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy reforms even lighter, even longer, than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have been even lower for even longer.
(2) Borrowing has long been less expensive than ten years ago, but now debt is literally cheaper than free.
So the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a more severe debt burden than before or half of the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity released from the formerly more borrowing and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed down key securities and asset classes to their most expensive levels, whether at pre-crisis peak or ever.
And not only do the strategists not only tone down the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the most severe recession in decades to the model it has ever seen before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the financial market pressures and risks are unparalleledly higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is next tightening its monetary policy.
Perhaps the vision of the future of Albert Edwards, strategist of the French bank Societe General, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has been training the bank's international investment clients for a long time to make the following full changes to the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to shut down the financial markets with even bigger QE financial scandals.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The company said that most of the reductions will be in HP's corporate services sector.
HP will be split in November between Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which focuses on sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's peak was in 2011, when it employed 350000 people.
In October last year, the number of staff was reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off expenditure of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 25 to 30 thousand employees.
The reduction in the consumer benefit will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees are in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are now responsible for more than 10% of its business income.
In the second year, its three largest customers accounted for 65% of its turnover.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for iPhone after the Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking Yleiset and then selecting Program Update.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to charge and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when they saw the error message  Software update failed.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone will guide the user through the final process.
This may include removing applications to gain space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also simplified the process with a new tool that suggests removable applications and then reinstall them once the update is complete.
It is best to make sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it could lead to a breach of the update.

Minister: Berner has served on the board of the tax havens company
The Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central), has served as a member of the Board of the Tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were related to the so-called tax planning.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he left the membership notice in May of this year.
I checked the case, and I've left a notice of termination.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains are done on the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the Swedish company Kährs' assets.
Kährs is a parquet dancer who merged with Finnish parquet dancer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013 and, following the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the assets of Kährs are held in Luxembourg through a multi-storey ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia Upfloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to ensure the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yelle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure in the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Kährs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is opening a reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniem is the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception desk is ready to take in the first 100 residents as of this evening.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people in a week.
The Immigration Office is setting up a reception centre on the former Salvation College property.
The operation is operated by Luona Oy, which is principally engaged in the production of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agreed on, inter alia, the security arrangements for the centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative work life extortion package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for government workplace challenges.
The organisation also wishes to involve other wage-earners' centre organisations.
President Antti Palola said that the focus was on Friday's rally.
We will then return to alternative means of reducing the price of labour.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola told reporters during a meeting of the organization's board.
Palola considers that the Central League for Living and Working Life (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the changeover insurance included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package will be EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the parties are very keen to have a conversation if they have a hundred people on the side.
Palola: The negotiations were constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, when the government is due to deliver a notice of its own package to Parliament and begin preparing for reforms.
Palola was not sure if the timetable was realistic.
The negotiating relationship with the government, according to Palla, exists, and it has been constructive to him all along.
The staff center's organization at the STTK airport, especially the Sunday morning surgery, is a painful place, according to Palo.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation that would implement some of the blackmail.
According to Palla, the STTK does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that brought the matter before it.
Employers will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's last week's work-life tightening package.
The package includes, for example, reductions in wages for the first days of sickness, halving overtime, reducing Sunday allowances to 75% and shortening holidays.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their views and that the strike was not intended.
AKAVA Fjäder thanks you
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder, welcomes the announcement by STTK that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now coming to the same lines as Akava, as Akava has already long been designed as an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, since without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, President of the ACA, wishes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lylly, will join us in preparing the presentation as an alternative to surgery.
The STTK of Antti Palola said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want a safe transfer and a working time ban.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it was ready to negotiate the government's goal of a 5% competitiveness deficit as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written alternative models for government proposals.
We're prepared to consider the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of movement and working time", says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join the Akava lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to develop a model that will go to the government and employers, says Fjäder.
The Akwa Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same wreckage" - playing bingo while Silvia talks in the evening
Green left at the University of Tampere
The Green Left of the University of Tampere's Vivan bingo club for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously delivered exceptional speeches during the Beltway riots and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the economic situation in Finland on Yle Channel on Wednesday night at 9.05pm.
The time for the request for such a speech by the Prime Minister is 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister, giving a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Rebellion in the Land.
After that, the president and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter War and the subsequent war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave the New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railroad strike in a televised speech.
The one-man show, the monarchist meanness.
The speech by the spider has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, tweeted that "Sipila could make his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the one-on-one conversation has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Judge condemned on Facebook that "monarchist manners: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne, challenged the Sibilla dialogue: "More than six months after the elections.
Not even a prime minister's appearance in the media with the opposition.
I tried.
What's the feast boy afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council Office, Sipila's speech was pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not yet received any information on the situation in the Member States.
The audience has been critical of Sipila's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was the public service's task to promote comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, as Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle Publications, told the news.
Like we were in the days of the Tammel
The speech has also sparked outrage.
When the evening comes, dinner is served in good time, the children are frightened and dressed to their best.
Mom puts a more beautiful strap on her and Dad ties the tie around her neck.
At nine o'clock, the silence is on the television as it was in the days of Me Tammeloides", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government has billionaires hiding in tax havens, writing amnesty laws for their fellow taxpayers and telling the people that they must cut when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Piaikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Leftist Viva of Tampere University.
It's posted a side-by-side bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
The Guardian: Western countries reject Russian proposal to expel Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected a Russian offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Akhtar, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to remove Assad from power in a stylish fashion after a while.
However, the West did not accept the proposal, believing that al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Mr Ahtisaar said that during the bilateral talks, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tsurkin had listed three points of the plan: the opposition should not be armed, dialogue between the opposition and al-Assad should be established immediately and the abdication of al-Assad should be done with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Marty, and I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
Ahtisaari says he sent Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr. Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Mr. Ahtisaar said there were no words.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaar's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups had refused any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Office, is hesitant to accept Mr Ahtisaar's remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Mr Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaar's claim is that Tshurkin spoke on behalf of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tsurkin's speech, I would have said I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin's spark to take power from some al-Assad supporter.
The flow of refugees from our own actions
During the negotiations that took place in Ahtisaar, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been displaced by war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own act.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We're now paying the bill we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari told the paper.
The asylum seeker's centre in Turku, Turku
The planned centre for asylum seekers in Northern Finland, planned by the Government, is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tower community building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki newspaper reported on Tuesday that the municipality had already decided to submit the school building to the Ministry for a public offering.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Deputy Mayor of the Borough of Tornion (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he told STT.
There were 36 delegates at the debate, out of 43.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On the basis of this, we can expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city received a call on Monday and responded quickly.
The community would have an estimated capacity of 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking whether it could be used for this purpose.
The site is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
The Owl still wants the labour market to offer an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the public halving of holiday funds would only cover part of the government's aim of lowering the price of work.
The Government, however, agrees that it will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners can agree on it.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in the parliament that he had not been in contact with the trade unions.
He also had no idea how seriously organizations were looking for alternatives to government-announced workplace harassment.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In the opinion of Mr Sipila, a halving of holiday funds would be a viable option, as it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's Sunday morning cut.
The social partners could agree to cut the holiday allowance between themselves because it is recorded in the labour contracts rather than in the law.
The Government will present its views to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the work life tightening in a Council communication.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the European Union is a very important one.
That's not the final limit.
The legislative work then starts, which means the train is moving and it gets harder and harder.
It's time to go.
It's not long in a thing like this, if you will, said Sipilä.
The list published last week by the government includes the transition of the working hours and the holiday to unpaid days without reducing the number of working hours.
In addition, the first sick days' wages will be cut, overtime payments halved, Sunday payments reduced to 75% and holidays shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as compulsory legislation beyond trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The workers' union organises a general strike on Friday, and several unions have declared political strikes.
The Lake Tohma Board approved the extension of the storage facility
The Lake Toh Board unanimously but slightly approved the extension of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy, the manure house.
The reason for the review was that the project was larger and more expensive than originally envisaged.
I'm also busy with the schedule.
It was a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of the 400-450 square metres of the stock was approved for the investment programme, but the funds will be decided on in the context of the quarterly report.
The list of proposals still included a EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenue to the local community.
The company does not have any risk as it pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Västost (ps.) argued.
The cattle tongue has a place in the river
The city has eased its previously strong stance to bring cattle-speaking street names to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the traditional cattle elections throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared as the capital of the Cattle Language because it has no historical basis and the Cattle Language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joseon area is more of an Eastern Savoy dialect.
After the new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street rides in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the cattle language, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the cattle language should also be taken with a grain of salt now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Carolina.
The language of Karjala is still a distinctive feature of the province, as is the image of Joensu as a forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used well in the county's many marketing activities.
The disconnection of the railway lines is cutting off the province's vitality.
The train cuts are hitting the county's vitality with a hard hand.
The transport links directly affect the business life and competitiveness of the province.
And that will affect whether it is even possible to live and work here, as the mayor of Jensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which he has also covered on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that we do not reduce our chances of success with state measures, as we are doing now.
The impact of the closure of these transport links on employment, for example, should be considered.
The deterioration of road connections is causing further challenge to the attractiveness of the University of Eastern Finland.
Of course, the better the services available, such as transport and housing, the easier it will be to get students and workers, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment Director Marko Junkkarinen says that even at the moment, marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult because of the poor traffic links.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, partly because of direct train connections.
From the river came one of my sorrows to the battle of the Beatitudes
The views of the Joseun City Council on the Siun Sotse project are apparently unanimous, but one vote is also among them.
City councillor Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) presented his resignation from the project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal was rejected.
The Council approved the proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalaine, which will be reviewed in early October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year.
Passenger train traffic from Eagle to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train is less common.
Passenger train services between Eagle and Kouvola will be changed in March.
One couple of trainers gets away, but still five times a day they get from Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications's train purchases will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million over the next four years.
The quietest routes will be completely closed.
VR will be setting new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped.
The rescue team let a 12-year-old climb up the roof from a ladder, but he couldn't get off the roof.
The situation was born in the Tower of Ketosis at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two-story wooden house on the site, with no stairs to the roof at all.
It did not stop a group of boys from climbing to the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next door.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped off the scene, and passersby alerted the rescue unit to help the last person safely returned to the surface with a tow truck.
FedEx's operating profit doubled, counting the 2016 fiscal year outlook
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the supply shortage cut its year-round earnings forecast, driven by weak demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
Its share fell by about 2.5 percent in the open house sale 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. says it expects to pay $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May, which is 20 cents below its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The lower outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9% which will come into effect on 4 January and despite higher charges for heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and online shopping is growing.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, said the company was "stable in view of the expected weak economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday pay were announced the day after competitor UPS announced that it planned to hire 90 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as last year's pay.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx's revenue was $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, down from the $2.44 average forecast.
The revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks's survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport which has halted its Express unit's turnover growth.
However, the rise in online trading has improved the performance of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the monthly period increased by 29%, but the revenues from operations were essentially the same due to the high costs of larger packages and the insurance itself.
The Express unit's income was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in the railway sector was lowered by higher labour costs.
In the opening trade, about an hour before opening time, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday at 11% year-on-year decline and 17% below its June 11 record.
This week, the U.S. central bank's decision makers will sit around a huge table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural painted in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed a double responsibility on the central bank to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank's executives have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement could be a decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so rigorous that it is not even predictable, to decide whether the US economy is ready to recover from the record stimulus that the short-term interest rate, which has remained near zero since the end of 2008, has brought.
While most data indicate that the economy is growing steadily, the recent slump in global financial markets may have made central bank officials already wary of increasing instability even more alarmed.
The labour market and inflation are understandably the first and most important factors to be monitored, says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
'I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for keeping interest rates high, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a valid basis for waiting,' he says.
The central bank's decision has not been agreed, which is already causing economic nervousness.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of economists predict interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator suggests that the growth potential is only around 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers can soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank would keep the level steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising that the central bank is raising interest rates right now", he says.
If policy makers raise interest rates, they must work hard to support financial markets so they do not panic.
Other experts argue that an increase in the level would calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank was raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early autumn that he expects the level to rise this year despite the Liberal Democrats' complaints of increasing economic development.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years and close to what the central bank considers to be the threshold for full employment.
The rise in wages has shown signs of cheering.
Although inflation remains below the central bank's annual target of 2%, according to central bank decision-makers, access to this is a temporary effect of a significant drop in oil prices.
The economy is experiencing higher interest rates and needs them in the face of the tight labour market situation, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% from its May record as investors feared that China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow is now almost 10 percent below its May peak.
For central bank decision makers, the market meltdown is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when to raise interest rates.
Without these financial market developments and the recent news of China's weak economy, policymakers would be at a higher level in this meeting says Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they have little information on the consequences of events in China, Oliner says.
The welfare of the international economy is not a central bank's main concern and should therefore in principle not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the suggestion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank could 'restrict the increase in money supply' caused a revolution in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, central bank officials are expected not only to consult other central banks and experts on future developments elsewhere, but also to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is more an art than a science, says Zachary Karabell, global strategy manager at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that the central bank had previously overreacted to financial market movements that appeared to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth, Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank canceled these cuts.
The central bank should only put financial stability first during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last milling will not come close to that level, Posen says.
No one wants to be in a situation where interest rates rise because markets are turning upside down, says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double requirement, and it does not mention financial stability.

The Brazilian Children's Health Organization in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for nurses
The Brazilian pediatric society SPRS has developed a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of breastfeeding babies with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet by pregnant women actually influences the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise is the most popular show on the network despite Nine's attempts to broadcast the executive broadcast on the Today Show.
The rush of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership's disgrace failed to increase Today's audience.
Nine's morning program was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The competing programme Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stranded in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The long distance weight did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise's average viewership in the five state capitals at 397,000, while Today's was at 339,000.
The real average increased slightly compared with the figures on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been catching Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunris's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers, while Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes are blowing in this morning elsewhere than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The big news on Seven was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing debut.
The new drama series, which drew an impressive 1.219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson would be the sole carrier of the popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave her real assurance.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new screening programme, hosted by Andrew O'Keeffe, took place on 17-17:30h, with an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) attracted 623,000 viewers, which was enough for a small win on Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the average viewership for the first half hour of The Chase Australia was 520,000, and the second half hour was 720,000.
The average for Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night average drop brings Nine's confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the audience of McGuire's program.
Originally published under the name Sunrise, Today remains local.
The final three agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he pick?
The secret's been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor is kept a secret.
The three remaining girls are not really going to be able to figure out who got the last rose.
However, in a conversation with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markos and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have inadvertently given a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood 's lips are sealed before Thursday 's finals .
All three women were poetic in their stories about Wood's perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when asked, 'If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?' their answers may have offered a revelation as to who won the boy's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncompromising since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, [Sara's] energy and Sam's energy felt quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very close to the earth, she's a joy to be with", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week's homecoming meetings made him realize that Wood might be right.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was clearly not just a game - I am now fully involved in this", he said.
When he asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was a mystery.
I don't know if I can say, he said.
I like the other girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has a lot of options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him moving to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the final game after this Australian rugby league player dropped the ball in his first flying shot on his return to the team in a 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next jet and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula was also revealed in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of making his new results a joke in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haynea at a post-game press conference.
49ers special correspondent Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the ball he had dropped and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane capture that the Minnesota Vikings captured in the first quarter.
This was certainly not the start Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for a man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on his way off the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio couple Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared his performance to his 2007 Origin debut, when a penalty shoot-out in his own goal area led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on her Instagram account in a photo she posted with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian courtyard.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his efforts to support democracy were curtailed.
Four people were killed in police shootings of rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's new constitution, the authorities said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
The district's top official, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before turning to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bands known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative appeared to cause so many deaths.
The summit was the culmination of weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, in which members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution are weakening their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands a state of their own.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed a treaty to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands.
Legislators have this week voted on the draft constitutional amendments in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said the new constitution could be approved by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center says there's a 60 percent chance of a storm south of Cape Verde.
A low-pressure front about 560 kilometers (560 miles) south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verdean archipelago has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second low-pressure front, located halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecasting center said.
Google is launching a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have arrived in Europe as they flee war and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published it on its donation campaign blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by the head of the company, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote from her personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe escalates, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would be the same amount for every donation made globally to google.com/refugeerelief, up to $5.5 million, so the overall goal is $11 million.
Europe is experiencing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may help diabetics who are slightly overweight
A new study shows that the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated by non-surgical means.
"It takes a long time to get death data", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgeon who wrote the main paper for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In thinning or bariatric surgeries, different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal cavity.
They reduce hunger and restrict food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study were obese and had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, or weight to length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If a BMI is greater than 25, it indicates that a person is overweight, and if a person's BMI is greater than 30, he or she is considered overweight.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery, hip replacement surgery and hip reduction, with the medicinal treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut off individuals dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, in those treated by non-operative means, BMI remained almost the same at 29.
Of the people who were cut, 36 percent had a complete and partial recovery from diabetes.
For comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
The researchers write that the hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 percent.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved glycaemic control, as shown by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the low-back group, the low-back group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had a higher weight loss index (7.4 and 5.1), had a higher decrease in haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and were more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
Blackstone, a fellow at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are studies in Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
In a Swedish study, overweight surgeons who underwent weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than those who had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study shows no improvement in surgical survival, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
The findings are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously", he says.
I believe that when a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it's very difficult to reverse the situation.
Not everyone can come to Europe  - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, the centre devoted to ethics research, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation the needs of all mankind should be put before the needs of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also insufficient.
"Not everyone can come to Europe", he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we must think of long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The last thing we need to do is think about how we can reduce the killing in their country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
He added that the use of force has never solved these problems.
In his stance on violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and argued that the US' violent response caused the chain of events to escalate.
After the 9/11 hearing, I wrote to President Bush expressing my condolences and told him that the solution to this problem was to be found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it produced unexpected consequences, the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, children's ingestion of hand sanitizer has quadrupled.
Toxicity centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the ingestion of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers in children under the age of 12 since 2010, reports the Georgia Toxicity Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Toxicity Data Center, the number of cases of swallowing disinfectants reported to the toxicity data centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Children are becoming more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are being upgraded, Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube that show teenagers drinking a disinfectant to get a cheap booster.
Reports suggest that teenagers have mixed a disinfectant with an alcohol-containing oral solution to make a stronger drink.
The pleasant smells of disinfectants can appeal to younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him", Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting ones (hand dishes) are those with added flavor.
There are some disinfectants that smell like peanut, grapefruit, and orange that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", said Stephen Thornton, director of nursing at the University of Kansas Hospital's toxicology data center, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey on the table, but the hand sanitizer is left on display, and if the kids are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago swallowed just four shots of peanut-flavored hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the ER for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the adult drinking limit, says primary care physician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was paralyzed while talking and could not walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed her through the night to a separate children's hospital for possible brain injuries, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Ortor Scott, the mother of the Nhaijah, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and remove them from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "exciting teacher by spreading bacterial poisoning into the classroom", says a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from his class.
The police must prevent the plan from being a foolish thing to do and leave the disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor has it Celtic have no conflicts.
Griffiths is downplaying the Celtic contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he's gonna turn it around.
Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on the lookout for recruits in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
Dons has increased his lead to five points in the Celtics.
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick led Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, giving the team a chance to increase the Celtics' lead to five points.
Griffiths is downplaying the contradictions .
There have been rumors of internal conflicts at Celtic, but Griffiths quickly overcame them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under close supervision as the team prepares to face the Dutch series manager.
I don't think we're under any pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship is boring the Dutch .
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "The Dutch are no longer showing the highlights of Celtic games and why?
Because the Rangers aren't in it.
People here don't get to talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in these teams' games, and people other than the Scots want to follow them.
Deila swore she'd turn the tide.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the tide.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a 10-man loss to Aberdeen, who now lead the series by five points.
However, Deila said: "Celtic have had bad episodes before, and we're going to get back up".
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We are, too, but we must move on.
We really need fans because it improves the performance of the players.
It's important to stay together now.
Warburton is on alert for player transfers in January.
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January player transfers, he's wary of the most likely recruitment, assuring that he doesn't want to confuse the team's consensus.
A former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different than the summer window".
For the players coming in this summer, the adjustment period is the time before the season, which is evident in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
The Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked to the Celtic transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 29-year-old has had ankle problems for two years and has not been able to find a new companion outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football League because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was taken off the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card that Collum had ever condemned in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by his statement, saying: "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths swore he would avoid Tyne Castle.
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded for admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn, before the Edinburgh Derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a momentary lapse of heart", the attacker added, "so it must be safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I move to Celtic".
The Tannadick government believes in the leadership of Dundee United, Donnelly.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn things around, but admits that the decline in players must stop.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get the boys back on their feet, says Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to win the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, were desperately involved in the game against the Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve their seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, which put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a cup or a league, that would not have won games like this.
Unemployment among Scots remains the same as the UK population rises
IN Scotland, employment remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9%, higher than in the United Kingdom at 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment now stands at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy".
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
If there's no legal intervention, I'll watch the man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the audience's log at Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I did.
I'm starting to get scared of this day as it gets closer.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, the officials have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, participants are selected by a frightening score.
Oklahoma has reduced the media seats to 12.
Whoever gets elected, they're gonna take it cold.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also made my own connection to him through the phone calls I've made over the months, and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a reporter, so I cannot carry a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember every detail.
A reporter in Oklahoma tweeted that I had been biased.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it to be told, and you can be a part of it.
I've chosen the reporter.
Hennen admitted that he could have put his word better, but still feels that what he is doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the anti-death penalty trend.
I have a reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, with me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcast I made for the series.
I'm not going to go through all the details again.
I can't say with any certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting anyway.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he didn't commit murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution of him is wrong.
And so this is the perspective I see him dying from.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
There'll be other reporters on the scene who will take care of it.
I'm going to give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I love die unnecessarily.
A man was pulled from the Canning River after a water police chase.
Officer Canning Vale was kept dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A Perth man's attempt to mislead police with his locks went wrong when he found himself in a low, black water just a few feet from a policeman who gently tried to drag him back to the beach.
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorised infiltration.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to mislead them by directing them to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not leaving, come get me,' " said senior Lieutenant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to wear out, so he used a safer tactic: "Consistent police consultation".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape", said senior Lieutenant Castledine.
The champion of soccer, Ben Cousins, is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blowback and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but he inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the newsmen tried to spy on him and threatened to stop the competition.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's editors tried to infiltrate his cabins last year, threatening to stop the race immediately.
He's accusing the editors and Racing Victoria's non-competition division of having a personal campaign going on against him, and on Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection of the race day treatment was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what's best for the competition and that he's been in a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplainedly positive cobalt display.
He's been keeping his tongue in check for a year and a half on the spy claims and didn't want to make it look jealous.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that it all comes out at once", Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk upright and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking differently, I'm not supposed to coach anymore.
I'd have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Earlier, Moody had tipped off a bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said the nonprofit had tried to spy on his barn.
"Two and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, and I'll name him when I ask, and offered him a job in my tavern if he gave me any information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, I'm guessing they should fire their lawyer because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to team up and maybe transfer responsibility to others besides the coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I being harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now may not make them think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really hurts me.
I'm pressuring them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on it.
The coach's frustration has grown with Lidar's long-term cobo investigation, and the late rejection has led him to conclude that he could throw a license over the table.
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated Black Caviar, has called for a rule on racing day care to be enforced after mud or mud is put on a horse's legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on it.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, just like it was.
It was race day.
Moody's could face a three-month ban on competition for the racing daytime grave treatment that the investigators initiated.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
A driver convicted of traffic fraud in Cobram has been arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic accident after he hit his biker over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was seriously injured when a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove off and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalya himself reported to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is attacking his rivals in a weight-loss match.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised claims by two NRL rugby league champions that his team's disruptions were part of the 'offensive'.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the refereeing allowed Storm to pioneer his side when it suddenly won the final match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to the Storm after it beat the North Queensland Cowboys in the final on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a rugby league "showdown" and said the two Queensland teams were not enthusiastic about the pressures of the game.
Bellamy defended his team's obstacles and said they were only focused on contact.
Bellamy added that his confidence was fueled by criticism of the two head coaches for the Storm, because that means they're afraid of losing to the team.
"This is always going to be a talk, "I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the game when we lost 24-2 to them, "Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our technology all year, but over the last six weeks, we've just been pushing the boundaries of the interceptors, and that's what's made us successful.
Trent's been with the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of an exciting rugby player by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing rugby.
Wayne's talking about the exciting thing about rugby.
He said it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell them how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010 when St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have the kind of players you want.
He brought that half out in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby, not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I feel more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between the Storm and the Roosters was more skillful than the one between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good one, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end?
We had a 20-18 game, so we had two more shots, but is that exciting rugby?
Or does breaking the defensive line and not scoring make it exciting?
For me, this is about the guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play them.
The Storm have a weekend off because they've already won the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-season game next Saturday night at AAMI Park.
$200,000 bail for a Serbian man on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for a 40-pound cocaine smuggling operation into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bond.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and was docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants at the ferry port all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovic is threatened with a possible life sentence for a cocaine holding company, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the entire amount and that he may have been in the cafe for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
He has strong ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 bond to secure his release.
"After reading the conditional testimony of both parties, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone was not enough to prevent her from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted bail on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and abide by his night and morning travel ban.
Stevan Hogg used the girl 's phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures .
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged into the social networking service, where Hogg received numerous indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, found the phone was missing, and found it asleep in Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found disturbing messages, and immediately she told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the scene, and found a worrying search engine search term that had been used to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to harass pedophiles on the Internet before pretending to be a cop to scare them.
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted to having carried out the funeral on a computer, but said that it was only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he was only doing this for feeding purposes.
He said he's sick of drinking and wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, trembled and cried.
My mother saw the indecent pictures on her phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the defendant had used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked younger.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking images of indecent children on June 14 last year, breaking bail on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court on March 24 this year.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to be entered in the sex offender register, since it could be argued that his crime did not include any significant sexual element.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed his sentence to October so that the social worker can have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other cases pending, he is being held in custody before trial.
He was added to the sex offender registry before the date of his sentencing.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a false speech to the parliament
Africa's oldest leader, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to his speech disorder.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall spread viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also marred by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had been sent unnamed death threats warning them not to bow to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with intermittent screams as he delivered a speech to Parliament on the state of the land, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their cell phones warning them to disrupt Mugabe's speech.
The number of the message is not correct, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that Parliament would be left untouched and that when they step out, Parliamentary immunity would be no longer in force.
The group's supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was concerned about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard has committed to cutting 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the enterprise services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its fastest growing business equipment and services business.
The expected job cuts will bring about costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable transport infrastructure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into new business, Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises will have annual sales of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unparalleled integrated technology solutions to enterprises, the company said in a statement.
The split breaks down a company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates of Stanford University, to manufacture electrical appliances.
HP has undergone a major restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in a field based on the belief that tightly-bound companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the match at Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his recovery is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even at his best, Wilshire will miss at least four England games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will play in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest regret in this latest problem is that Wilshere's final season was a strong one after an individual ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season started.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but as Wenger admitted, when a player tries to return midway there is always a risk of further injury.
There's also an uncomfortable model in the making.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since making his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
In the six seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the Premier League teams to have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger's willing to give the witch a chance, but Arsenal believe their recovery from last season's injury will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, there can be a season when you have to build up and compete", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he gets the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to re-sign his squad as Arsenal begin their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, followed by games on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably in the beginning.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a breathing pause to the players who need it", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear defending champions of F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most feared stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 games since they produced their own undefeated campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season's Champions League surrender to Monaco, and is motivated by a still-distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This is a huge motivation", Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not a team of scoundrels.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not available in the series, especially given that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever and suicide rates among young men are higher than at age 15.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company's troubled Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Men, challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 high school and college students who showed symptoms of depression found that a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of their friends were healthy.
Similarly, those who were not depressed had a halved likelihood of developing potential mental health problems if they had healthy friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of social media communication, style is outweighed by content, and the immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though isolation is real.
This superficial success is governed by what psychologists call external values: money, image, social status, all at the expense of inner values -- inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The great thing about Frendi was that it turned this focus on its head.
No one character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished by their interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs from Joey and Chandler, moments of comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel, their humor came from knowing that yes, men can identify with anything, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a volunteer at the Samaritans' Association explained to me: ...As I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have truly understood how a little interaction with a friend can improve their mood.
Often, men who contact us feel they can't talk to their friends.
The old idea of getting over yourself is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you'll be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, outgoing position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're going to Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming locations are redesigned to honor the party, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee?
Or, what's even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what your friendship can mean.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to beat Malmö .
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan the paintings against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG to beat Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally opened their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut in less than four minutes, showing the way for the French champions, but the team missed several opportunities before finally increasing their lead on Cavan's 61st minute goal.
Paris, who are in the same A-League as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only had a place in the game but also improved on their quarter-finals in their last three rounds.
But even though PSG scored, it was not a classic match, as Laurent Blanc's Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of a goal and was later replaced by the field.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will create problems for the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though we have some things to deal with this season", Blanc said.
This was a good thing.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I regret we couldn't make one or two more paintings.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after an injury in one of three changes after the team was relegated 2-2 in Ligue 1 home match against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he was left in the fourth minute in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he left Manchester United last month, the Argentine striker was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why, when he ran Marco Verratt's pitch behind Malmö's defensive line and then hit a beautiful finish over Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a tough opponent, winning the final against Celtic to reach this level, with nine international players and five defenders in the opening round and two in the deep midfield.
But the offensive team offered little more than a 34th minute shot by Nikola Djurdjic, which went past the pin button on Kevin Trapp's painting.
However, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to missed shots and poor finish, particularly from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five attempts in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in Ibrahimovic's touch at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in presenting his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic's kick, Di Maria sent a round kick that tilted Wiland's pitch around the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour later, thanks to a sixth goal of the season by Uruguay's Cavan after Ibrahimovic had pressed forward from Maxwell's left-handed cross.
That ended Malmö's hopes of getting back in the game, and only Wiland's brilliant refusal to kick David Luiz's straight kicks kept the final numbers low before the substitute Ezequiel Lavezz's goal was scored at the end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were equal to his team.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I'm going to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion from the sale of shares.
The Swiss mining company Glencore, which suffered from a collapse in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a press release that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to cut its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in China's economy weighs on demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new mark raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trading.
The shares rose by 2,77% to 131,60 pence in the FTSE 100 Index, opening at a higher rate of 0,69%.
Glencore had unveiled last week a $2.5 billion stock deal as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold its new equity for 125 pence a share, which was a 2.4% reduction in the closing price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth a total of 9.99% of the merger.
Concerns over the prolonged stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement released Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and the wife of the President, Michelle Obama, are having dinner for X and her spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing President Obama and President X with an opportunity to discuss constructively issues of disagreement added to the agenda.
With the visit, first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with several US technology leaders before heading to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and the country's increased uncertainty in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is downplaying the differences in filmmaking.
Matt Damon and African-American filmmaker Effie Brown were talking about a difference Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
On HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown's talk about the need for different perspectives when it came to the dark protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series", Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted incredulously, commenting, "Oh! Wow. Okay, while the comments of the actor on The Martians were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat the character of Harmon", Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore who gets beaten by her white partner.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the film's rights from finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied with a dull response that their direction would end up giving us something we don't want.
When the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to anger Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film's plot, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WORKful that it hurts".
Since its publication, Twitter has amassed over 5,000 re-tweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the media's accurate portrayal of race is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide, urging lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince was referring to the release of the Grammy Award nominees for Album of the Year.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently released a statement in response to Fox News anchor Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group", the leaders said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional bodybuilder and bowl collector Isaac Caldier became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, and was awarded the grand prize of $1 million.
At the end of its seventh season, no competitor had ever been able to complete all the stakes in the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last mission involved climbing a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and overcame the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to complete the tiring fourth installment of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero did so three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard-earned win and was still shocked to win the grand prize of $1 million.
"It's great to think about this, since I've never earned or lived on less than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed sat down to discuss the final with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten won't get more prize money, even though she's the first contestant ever to cross the finish line.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money goes to the one with the fastest time", Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and life-changing, he still finds great satisfaction.
I don't think he's upset about that.
He's just so happy to have gotten to do what he did.
His fans have been praising him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior is returning for a eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are running past the Minnesota Twins .
Minneapolis -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams in the country, but now they're last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their role of a complete wrecker on Tuesday, when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed the opportunity to advance to the semifinals of the American League's second wild card game against the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night of a six-letter H-word pair that had been very hard to reach for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get it", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers catcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit made three runs in the first two rounds, then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) gave up 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality wave in his last nine games.
"I just want a strong finish to this year", Simon said.
It's hard for a rep to play every game, and that's why I want to get into the game.
Tigers quarterback Victor Martinez hit three home runs and allowed two runs, his first of those since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-pointer after hitting four home runs against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well", Ausmus said.
He looked good (in weight training), looked much better in weight training, and continued to play the same model.
The Twins were three runs behind in the bottom half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting two outs on the left field.
Right-handed Aaron Hicks retired with one jersey and Simon was directly burned by second-hander Brian Dozier before Simon was traded to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player facing off, to the upper-leading substitute Miguel Sanoa, who took two laps to the left from right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a two-runner on the two-point line, VerHagen had three-point Trevor Plouffe hit the double-digit lead.
It was a major-league record, 27th this season, when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had a run of nine in the first inning, Mauer scored two runs against Tigers pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
But the right-hander burned Sano's three strokes on his fifth save.
Detroit initially used Phil Hughes, who was rusty.
The Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who was left off the injured list before the game after being sidelined for over a month with a lower back infection.
"Obviously, I didn't want to start like this", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt better, and I felt I could make some nice moves in the third inning".
After Hughes hit the opening pitcher in the first inning, he let second-seeded Ian Kinsler advance one more time.
The right-handed walk by J.D. Martinez in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to the line of scrimmage, who took himself to the first pitch in midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 pipe when the runners were in good running position.
Triple-A player Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was dismissed for his attempt to advance to the triple-A.
The Tigers went on to win the second inning and got one shot, two in the nest run from hitter James McCann and two in the nest run from center Anthony Gosse, then the score was 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Paul Molitor, the Twins' manager.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew in the right direction.
Hughes started to be in the catcher's den and fed the third inning of the game, then was replaced by right-handed forward A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs on six hits and four walks.
NOTE: Right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez of the Tigers was sidelined with a sprained shoulder.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August for a shoulder injury, but he was scheduled to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will be on the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norway's Tigers record is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to the Tigers on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a right abdominal defect.
The Tigers-Twin three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set to pitch against right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana of Minnesota (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open up the economy to the wider world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide reform.
China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and develop a policy of transparency, he said at the 16th meeting of the Group for the Deepening of Globalization.
Supporting transparency while pushing reforms forward will add new movement and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, a relaxation of border control policies, an invitation to state-owned enterprises to pursue private capital and a review of the resident registration system.
The opinion states that a negative list will be created to identify the sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system shall be tested and improved gradually through experimental programmes.
The change is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on law and making the market more open, the opinion states.
The government also weakens its control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are being opened up to private investors to open up government sectors.
The Government will not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide them with better services, the opinion said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, green cardien, is facilitated by optimising requirements and easing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of lawyers to practise and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, the statement released after the meeting said.
