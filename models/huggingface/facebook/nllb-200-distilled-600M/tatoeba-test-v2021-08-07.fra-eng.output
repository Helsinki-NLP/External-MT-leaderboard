White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black pawn at h4 - chess and mat! That's what we call jokingly in chess circles the madman's mat.
White: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawn on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which black has only two options: take the tower on a6 or move their crazy to any other square of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, white players advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer chess and mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
