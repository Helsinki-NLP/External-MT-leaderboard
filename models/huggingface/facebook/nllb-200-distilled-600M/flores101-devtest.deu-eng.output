This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid on the lower side.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  reverse hooks and barbules  the researchers concluded that the rachis were probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or heartbeat, and the researchers suspected that the specimen, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, showed the feathers of an adult and not the downs of a chicken.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not chicken feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the police headquarters of the Turkish town of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty others.

To determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma stream, the luminous force and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic field's polarities.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts its gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as the large caves on Earth, which often have fairly constant temperatures, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona".
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a pre-printed sheet of paper on which the candidate for their election is registered in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives who will be present as witnesses to each part of the proceedings.

She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be tampered with because her picture was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they post photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is the lead prosecutor, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a return to the state of the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a 10-year military presence in the Jordan Valley from the date of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept such a presence for only five years.
The protectors of the accompanying pest control attempt should be closely monitored by rangers as the attempt has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick OFlynn, NPWS's Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunt received extensive safety and training training.
Martelly yesterday swore an oath to a new nine-member provisional election commission.
It's Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The unsuccessful election, some of which have been on hold since 2011, has triggered the violent protests.
Over 60 cases of overheating on defective iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company described as 'non-serious.'"
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The quake shook Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Protection Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older woman when she had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two Black Box aircraft.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna, too.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of the extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, very unique, just like her, a strong woman.'"
Dustin Goldust Runnels made the following comment: Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more crazy... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the share of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three-legged relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to relieve his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists are promising insights into how planets, especially the earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and callousness".
There's speculation that he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to enable flight controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport are provided and the overland trains will not stop at Wembley.
With the concern about the lack of transportation, the probability of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's fans increased.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within just two generations, although it had previously been thought that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal, and it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red carbonic acid.
The color of the coal juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been taken away (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Remnants of wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses visited by men and women in mixed society.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest service the bicycle has done us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the railroad, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized predators, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion ravens act similarly to wolf or dog ravens, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other large cats) and are equally lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar does not sound like the full-mouthed roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of roaring words.
Ozelots eat small animals, and if they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals the ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists believe that the Ozelotes track and detect animals for food with their sense of smell.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually aligning themselves with their surroundings and then plunging onto their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it used before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciesization, which simply means the emergence of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make clothing from plants, we feed mainly on plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus another set of teeth on his palate, which meant there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurians, and maybe even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex could not handle it.
While we may be familiar with much of their food, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, fowl, snail, and a type of rodent called the seven-legged sleeping squirrel.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich preferred to have a banquet together, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of God.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to conform to the gods' will by ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar room that was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not become so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard. The shops were just open shops on the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to the old Norse legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although all countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Knights Templar", you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the text says something on the back of the piece, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence", dated 4 July 1776, which is located at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293⁄4 inch x 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the label was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the French Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them".
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
After only two weeks, the American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is separate from itself, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, the 13 states formed a weak central government, consisting only of the Congress, based on the Federal Treaty.
Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial system, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all its laws, often uncooperative.
It also had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and the States took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands that became Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as the 'archipel.'"
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the native cultivation of grain and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used stand-up format is 35 mm, which is the dominant film size at the end of analog film fairs.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35-mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The side-ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) have exactly the same or very similar side ratios.
The much-deprecated and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple directive that creates momentum while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection of the lines that triangulate a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was undergoing a test.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had kept European nations together despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are there for that very reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the Church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to doubt whether this principle was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire seafloor sections, which posed a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each time period in China and each family that was in power was a dynasty of its own.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, bitter wars raged among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Even after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class ranking, the army ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing is seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little is seen or heard of this world.
The pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombstones, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The outline symbol looks like a V and the outline symbol looks like a bracket or square where the bottom line is missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The highlighting usually generates a softer sound, while the drawing is more powerful and expressive.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, and should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 in Versailles by a mob of market women.
They were travelling in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a screaming mob of people threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure on the conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and interest on bonds flowed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits that stemmed from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period of time in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other, that technology, in turn, has an impact on societies that are more inherently than socially determined.
For example, it can be argued that the passenger car inevitably involves the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, it is geography that shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures emerged in relation to that geography, and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily ostracized laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, due in large part to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world was also moving from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, Western styles are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was slowly developing its own style, and one of the most important developments of the time was that people began using buttons to attach clothes as a result of the crusades.
The purpose of the agricultural sector is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic cultivation that uses saved, native seed in the eco-region and combines it with exchange-traded funds or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation with a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called 'wilder' or wild. Some wild children have been held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations".
Wolf cubs may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within his physical capabilities) that are almost completely in line with those of his specific caregiver, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, Scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
So scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office clamp in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistive devices are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and educational, but many are forced to do so.
We think the nursing home system is a security for these children.
Our care family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The nursing home shall cover all the needs which they did not have in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specificities of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefits and rewards approach.
For example, learning and socialization are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustainable relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for interpreting microexpressions, few millisecond facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still properly appreciate the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
It also has serious consequences if left untreated: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (anthophytes, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep break is the process of being awakened during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way to do this is to drink plenty of fluid before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is known to have a urinary effect) and get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force there is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, in principle, and it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga is used to awaken the Kundalini energy through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god yoga, where the visualization of different deities cleanses the energy channels, opens the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war ended, the collision of systems, history and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a re-positioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods while also hampering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as farm animals to easily access their milk, fur, meat and skin.
The goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed hills or other pasture areas, and were looked after by goats, much like the more well-known sheep herders, often children or young adults.
In England, the first transport lines were built in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rough roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced early on to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realization was made that rails bearing a band of iron were more efficient.
This became commonplace, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railways were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking, which began two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (which means "right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not rise as regularly.
Doubtful species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little bit.
In many cases, this is just a symptomatic treatment, but if you don't want temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is very obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of the people have become more serious.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the John Dunlap printing plant.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that remain are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers -- or bits, to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately detectable, but the symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of swallowing poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term Wanze is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both predatory and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or housing of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the event of an adoption, the physical parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over parental responsibility.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based largely on the presence of body cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cycle-specific behaviors, which are not just responses to signs of external cycles, are known to most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run free-wiring cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material concerned and whether the cells concerned are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points to this massive carbon economy that has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you'll rarely hear a similar number of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such failures, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, since driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows are a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically roughly.
In order to better illustrate traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of infrastructure on the road.
Insects were the first animals to ascend the heavens, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find efficient food and sexual partners.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hideouts to hide in from predators.
Today, dragons and daybirds are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements.
Some people thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolves around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river on earth, carrying more than eight times the amount of water as the second largest stream.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon mainstream is 6,387 kilometers long, absorbing water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they are all found in nature in their original form and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, pencil has fallen into the background, pushing back its status and use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a leader.
You can be curious about what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy car over a hill, and if the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay at little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the tides and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more Mary on the near side, since the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's theory of the need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and hiring employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and take everything for himself.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization take the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization?
When all the resources available across all the departments of an organisation are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative approach to meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition, thus limiting the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supported by scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies are making it possible for us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, the development of strategies and schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution, allowing students to view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital each year, and the website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collectible album.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger struggles to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them.The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires students to write smartly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's texts and present their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north the pristine beauty of nature extends into Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more characterize Ontario beyond what outsiders consider to be typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or France and are known as luxurious seascapes.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the European-India caravan.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual family status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed, etc.
When you reject men, be consistent and do not hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences, however, do not mean that it is okay!)
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods like Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tin can are sold, but all this is for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, every stay outside Goma should be carefully planned to experience the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at Risk due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily fees for protection and admission.
It may also be worth buying a wild card, which allows access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focal point of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong Skyline have been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is visible from the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urbanisation is concentrated on newly acquired land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you're looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove belt, stretching for more than 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian state territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal kingdings and some 30,000 spotted deer now live there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses departing between 06:30 and 07:30 hours, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang.
Since buses between the districts are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Collector taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and two runways with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge has a height of 15 metres and construction was completed in August 2011, but the permit for traffic was not granted until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs inspection posts are expected to be completed by then.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for subsistence.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Greater West Indies, was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.x
For information on competitions and points of sale for polo tickets, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted on the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, but British and American currency may be accepted. Ask the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it's summer there, while it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in the summer months are usually above 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority has directed visitors to stay away from bears and wolves for at least 100 yards per meter and from all other wildlife for 25 yards per meter.
No matter how peaceful bison, wasp, elk, bear, and virtually all large animals may seem, they may come under attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking highly fragrant foods, and be careful to keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a disgraceful naval patch in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities, and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a nice shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more tolerable.
You can drink the local tap water without any worries, but if you're worried, you'll find water that's filled up.
"For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. A small black one is an espresso, cappuccino is filled high with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube squalls occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April 1770 north of the equator, and can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat being in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay at the destination after arriving.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as tenting, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for yourself if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers choose to camp locally, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the scene, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that in some parts of the festival, music is still played late into the night, even if the music on the main stage has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as ice breaking causes quite a terrible noise for the most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city.
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and sometimes it is hard to find exits.
They usually have a special offer of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them staying.
Some gambling establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of remaining sober.
If you want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On roads that are covered with snow, the liability is low and you cannot drive like you are on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or rolling snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, freezing and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to run uninterrupted most of the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
In common parlance, the term safari refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy, and you can better watch them with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a bush trip, a walking safari or a walking tour) is a walk that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation guidelines vary, but as of the end of March most cancellation guidelines due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, an average of about ¥7,000.
Many hotels offer iron and steel bars even when you're not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you do not want to wear curved socks, you can try using a forklift if one is available.
Make sure the material does not get too hot (this can shrink it or in extreme cases cause burns).
There are several methods of water purification, some of which are more effective in countering certain hazards.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals they do not know from their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by violence are not usually classified as insects.
Customs-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods which are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers whose destination country has high tax rates can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the greatest driving challenge, often leading through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the country roads, be careful: steep ravines, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate here.
The speed limits indicated are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than many other areas of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit baking is widespread, with apples being baked all year round and cherries and plums being used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is known as Berlin, pancake or crop, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either dry or wet.
Inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attribution, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the island, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with Javanese preference for peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut flower sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
The riders' legs are supported by a riding handle on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get trapped inside them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with his foot on the treadmill, he may be dragged along when the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures may be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a sash and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some seats, particularly English seats, have safety belts that allow a climbing beam to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  Chile's most important climbing destination, known as Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you can get a ski or snowboard on your feet and climb down a slope on a snow-covered underground.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as Skipenner, planning their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine skiing, but does not necessarily include mountain climbing, as the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much more rigid skiing and boots.
Consider the ski route a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you are able to travel slightly longer distances than walking  Very rarely will you reach the speed of running on well-maintained runways without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries, and usually you would have to apply for multiple visas and pass through multiple passport checks if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each Schengen Member State individually, which saves time, money and red tape.

The definition shows geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique" although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.

There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender-equal operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for the return trip.
Governments are willing to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated on the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
Security inspections have also become much more intrusive in the period after 9/11.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when they pass the scanner.
Rift currents are the recurrent flow of beach-broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming backwards is no harder than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you're not caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust back to their culture of origin.
When you come home from a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and abandoned some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding may not be expected of returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's still before the show starts.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula pass here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest peak of which is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in a clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, and by expeditions requiring data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to that service.

In general, there is a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to get to the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight boats owned.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days, while returning in the evening and staying overnight on the ship.
If you are only going ashore during the Bordeaux excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown or have a traumatic experience behind them.

Learning more about the operation and operation of airplanes during a flight can help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the quick delivery of goods, and time is often a very important factor in corporate documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies used their own aircraft, but on other routes and on smaller ones, difficulties arose.
If they were to ship goods by air, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through it faster was to ship it as abandoned baggage, because airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to add a big batch of money to the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to bear the cost).
But that's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for business and elephant for first class!
In general, it is pointless to seek discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money and charge appropriate prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.

Please treat this place with the dignity, respect and respect that you deserve.
Don't spoil the place by putting or scratching graffiti.

The barbarian appearance of the Parisians disappears very quickly when you put in the groundwork.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mostly scrub, ferns and ponds, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owl, lynx, wildcat and chicken as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go up to the knees and cover their shoulders.
Although most monasteries have wrap-around skirts for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that extend over their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each wearer, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.

Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution was not the problem it is today during its peak, it is usually found in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
