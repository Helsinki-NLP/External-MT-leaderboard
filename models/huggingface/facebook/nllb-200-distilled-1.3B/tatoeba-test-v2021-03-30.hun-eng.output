That's in the past.
I'm trying to control myself.
He's wiped the dust.
This dress is a bargain.
He gave up to go abroad.
It's a very old book.
He always asks your opinion.
It's ugly, it's yellow, it's creaky, and it doesn't match anything, but at least they don't run over in the dark.
It's a wise choice.
It's not that far.
There are a lot of schools in this town.

I can never thank you enough.
The stakes are high.
Tom showed Mary the way.
I need coffee.
Tom is persistent with his question.
Tom shoveled Mary.
Tell him to hurry.
They were very happy when we arrived.
What are you cooking?
It's a gray stone building.
I found it in the attic.
Tom was waiting.
Look at you, man.
It's time to rest.
He explained the rules to me.
I was resting.
This old building is not worth tearing down.
We can't get any more.
I took off my shoes.
Everyone is fine.
He needs this.
Tom is useless.

There's no elevator in the building, and I can barely perform with my sore knees.
That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things: either destruction, and the dead are not conscious of anything; or, as we are told, a real change: the soul's migration from one place to another.
Don't get lost.
That was a stupid question.
If you've read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you'd just finish telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
It's only natural.
What are you doing? !
I'm gonna put my passport back in the safe.
Tom felt it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mary.
You know almost nothing about that animal.
You take care.
When Tom woke up, Mary was taking a shower.
Get your ass out of here.
Everybody was all over me.
The show was a success.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Is he sick or a doctor?
Tom was a nervous child.
The leaves turn red in two or three weeks.
No one can live to be 200 years old.
He'll call me from time to time.
Something's not right.
