Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulation of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends across the EU/EEA countries and the UK which confirms that while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the knowledge gained from Italy, the country, hospitals and ICUs need to increase preparedness for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia related to an unknown diagnosis theory was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as the active ingredient is now referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The data to date is that 80% of COVID-19 infected persons have mild infections, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Of the 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious illness that requires hospitalization, while 6% cases develop into a more serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this survey, we are reviewing trends in the cumulative cases of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, and comparing them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy between 31st January and 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Following China, COVID-19 is spreading more geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world are currently following this country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020.
In the March 5th issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases among individuals returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, were reported by France on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported since 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number and extent of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only reports the number of COVID-19 cases counted in each country worldwide, obtained from government sources such as the countries' Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it to what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for active COVID-19 outbreaks, we calculated the 14-day short-term increase in COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK over the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We have also presented the cumulative numbers of cases reported in each country as of 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am and compared them with the cases in Italy from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day short-term increasing incidence trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed the same trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative cases of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was driven primarily by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing COVID-19 incidences (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK for the period 31 January-15 March 2020 with Italy.
It is noteworthy that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy's only three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, national public health responses are different, and countries may have different definitions of cases and different protocols for screening patients that must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study in the form of 4.2 beds per 100,000 lakh in Germany from 29.2 in Portugal showed a large-scale difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010/11).
Modelling of healthcare capacity saturation situations, with a view to the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations in each EU/EEA country and the UK, shows that there is a > 90% risk of ICU bed capacity overrun and this is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
As cases are still clustered across EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK, and hospitals and ICUs typically provide a specific regional service to the population, it is advisable to obtain information on infected and ICU beds in the Regional Unit Naming System for the NUTS-2 level.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICU should therefore prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission situation of SARS-CoV-2 and the growing number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare and especially intensive care, as occurred in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and holistic approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection is essential, with a shift from containment to mitigation approach, as unless implemented early, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, adopt and utilize their response accordingly.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the strain on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, bringing a catastrophe to humanity.
SARS-CoV is similar to its homologous virus, which caused SARS in several thousand people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause the same symptoms through the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more contagious and affects older people than younger and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of disease epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention, and will also cover the following topics:
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on 25th January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all the Chinese people who were told to stay indoors for weeks after the holiday due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the associated disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, with over 40,000 patients released and over 3,000 patients dying.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""People's Enemy No. 1"" and possibly more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7th January 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment have been published which have identified virus sequences isolated from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing field.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 pandemic).
We discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prediction and some remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, causing about 15% of the common cold cases.
However, in this century, we have twice been exposed to highly pathogenic bacterial human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started an epidemic outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with dire symptoms and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the pneumonia clusters that were of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
The CoV sequence was released seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers were notified of the infection, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan city was locked down and all public transportation was shut down.
The first diagnostic study of the disease on January 24th stated that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with Wuhan seafood market, which is considered to be the origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and some 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2).2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined as the situation is rapidly expanding.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre survey of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has been seen mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 of those infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in waves, mainly in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
The average time from onset of COVID-19 to diagnosis is 5 (2-9) days.
The average incubation period of the pathogen was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the period of mass transportation before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the combined mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subclass of large and enveloped viruses containing a single formula of sens RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope key (S) glycoprotein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidial peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then membrane binds.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope with glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins forms a genomic RNA virion-containing vesicle or gland, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel type of beta-CoV with a genetic identification of more than 99.98% among 10 sequential samples collected from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, the source of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 has much more similarity to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV genetically.
Through scanning electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the microscopic portion of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
It was reported that human ACE2 was a receptor in human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 relatively more weakly than SARS-CoV-2 does, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms an innovative micro protein encoded by orf3b and may also form a protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in its ability to cause viral disease and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a compound containing the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed adaptive mixture was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoVs.
For reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials.
Primary and intermediate wearers
It has been reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans through civet cats and camels, respectively.
By a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host virus helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown and the route of transmission is yet to be explained in detail.
Ji and others who introduced snakes from bats to humans as carriers of the virus that are involved in homologous reassortment between S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that long-horned pangolins, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology, among the CoVs detected in ant-mammal SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore conclusive results are still awaiting for a solid proof (Fig. (Fig.33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive outside the body for up to 5 days in a dry environment for 48 hours and at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race is generally immunocompromised against SARS-CoV-2, and therefore at risk of being infected with the novel virus.
No detailed studies on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported at this time.
Thus, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, once a virus enters the host, it is first identified by the host's innate immune system via pattern-marking receptors. These receptors include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus survive the immune system response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell death.
Immunity of the body including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential to fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovering patients repel MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hypersensitivity to immunotherapy locally produces large numbers of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multi-organ deformity or even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a rapid onset, is more likely to affect elderly individuals and pregnant women with pre-existing conditions.
It is common for people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or who have a weakened immune system to be more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period of the disease was 3 days on average and the duration ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study as described above showed that the exposure period of the pathogen was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate exposure times, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected to asymptomatic people.
As a general practice, people who are infected or have been in contact with the virus generally need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the primary symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea.
A week after the onset of the disease some patients experienced dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and/or hypoxemia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy rapidly.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be tested for the virus in the initial diagnosis even if there are no pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms were fever, 76% were dry cough, 55% were dyspnea and 3% were diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by infection from an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients and is consistent with the higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13) -25%) were the main symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of 14 February, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2% while the confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 8,096 (10%) of confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was as high as 6.47, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster onset is often in the same family or from the same group or vehicle such as a sea vessel.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or exposure to infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks of developing symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and that patients who have been released from hospitals and recovered may carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphopathy and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found with lymphocyte count <1 × 109 /L and white blood cell count <4 × 109 /L. For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphopathy and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found with lymphose number <1 × 109 /L and white blood cell count <4 × 109 /L.
Some patients had elevated liver and muscle stimulators and myoglobin levels in the blood, and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte subpressure in the blood.
In severe cases, levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have chest radiography abnormalities and are characterized by bilateral impervious shadows or opaque abrasive glass in the lungs.
Patients often have asymptomatic pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung weakness.
So, the worst type of chest radiographic scans are often seen in the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18th February, 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytes discomposition, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nucleated sincyteal cells in the lungs of deceased persons, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main benchmark for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to extremely high false-negative rates, which can accelerate the pandemic, from February 13, 2020 in China, clinical or diagnostic manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation has been observed in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the linkage of disease history, diagnostic displays, laboratory tests and radiological investigations is essential and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects isolated fragments of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than one hour, without the need for extensive equipment.
It is hoped that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and efficacy when tested on diagnostic samples.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians can provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients as well as other CoV-compounds such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2) with various therapies previously used or recommended.
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychosocial support for current and potential treatments.
Plasma from recovered patients was even suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and also possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and disability are the main threats and the leading causes of death among patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and is lifesaving, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-cutoff ventilation, and mechanical ventilation that is cutoff depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock, and protect vital organ function in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been reported to result in cytokine disruption from an immune overreaction in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine catastrophe is a form of tissue-specific inflammatory response that occurs through the release of classes of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines release large amounts of free radicals through immune cells, which are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression of immune response is essential in the treatment of cytokine disorders, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilezumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disorders.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine disruption include T cell-directed immunosuppressive response modification; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK mitigation; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling 4 inhibitors; and HDAC inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the chances of recovery.
However, short courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended to be used with caution for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed as of writing.
However, intravenous administration with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential resistance to other single-form RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied the compound to China to run a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as potential therapies for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from falling victim to the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against germs and other foreign objects, and they detect and directly mitigate specific molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it decreased inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and verification and clarification is needed before proposing approaches for mass use.
Also, in terms of therapeutic effects, some complications associated with plasma should be considered with caution.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially fatal toxicity.
Blood levels of antibodies are generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing antibodies at a certain stage is difficult to combat global pandemics.
Thus, it is more important and rewarding to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes to monitor effective antibodies against the proteins needed by the virus or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their optimal combination are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main treatment options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe episodes.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were reported to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Many provinces in China where TCM was used in 87% of patients had the highest recovery rates, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only roughly 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing WM and TCM combination therapy with Western medicine (WM) treatment.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, symptoms to resolve and hospitalization was significantly less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the rate of decline in signs (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM await further controlled trials at larger scale and at more centres.
It will also be interesting to identify the process of work and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatment or their combinations.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience extreme fear of highly contagious and even life-threatening illnesses, and those in quarantine also experience feelings of loneliness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, cough, and adverse medical effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to further anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a wide range of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on people's families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those who have come into contact with them as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple medical disciplines, with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plan, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are needed to prevent the chain of infection from animals to susceptible animals and infected humans, and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and robust resistant antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, before starting a clinical study, the bioavailability of these vaccine candidates in elderly humans and in lethal-challenge models and their protection against human-to-human transmission of the virus from animal sources have not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the scattered incidence and MERS outbreak continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the affected areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and several have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people who are not immune is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required (average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic mutation of CoV-complexes.
As a novel disease, the full diagnostic course of COVID-19 has only just begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients with no prior condition can recover gradually.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher morbidity and mortality rates in severely infected patients.
Therefore, it is imperative for healthcare agencies to develop a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on the diagnostic studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with disease-specific indicators in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of those patients who were over 50 years of age, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age group of 30-65 years.
Patients who required intensive care were also more likely to have other conditions and complications and were significantly older than others (median age of 66 years vs. median age of 51 years) which indicates age as a disease-specific factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: Men have been more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Multiple diseases and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are at higher risk of severe heart attack and arrhythmia.
Also cardiac events were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, resulting in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormal data: Blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissue and have been suggested as a potential disease-specific indicator for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation between CRP level and severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during cell damage.
So, these are the traditional markers for heart or liver failure.
Key diagnostic symptoms: The timing of chest radiography and the progression of diagnostic symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict the complications and outcome of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were used at high rates in severe SARS patients, many respondents suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients often suffered unusual stress due to prolonged quarantines and extreme uncertainty and seeing close family members and fellow patients falling victim to death.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
In addition to making replications in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively make replications on the surface of the respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoVs responsible for the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected at the early stage or during the exposure period can produce large amounts of virus during daily work, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, whereas most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
China is currently undergoing a massive effort, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others predicted that COVID-19, which is proving to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbine and throat lacerations of recovered and discharged patients 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus will become a similarly cyclical episode to influenza.
However, there are optimistic indications in China based on the falling number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would cause a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could become vulnerable to infection and eventually die out or become a relatively less infectious virus in coexistence with humans.
A comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is shown below (Figure (Figure 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and also possibly through direct contact with contaminants contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, highlighting the new possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases showed that 41% of cases were probably due to nosocomial (hospital-derived) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Thus, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers and even those close to the sick or infected people need to take adequate precautions to keep them safe.
Wearing masks can be used as the first stage of protection to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or getting stuck on the surface of objects, from where they could have spread to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860) masks can protect against inhalation of small viruses such as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are around 85 nm.
As particles can enter even through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series# 1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflamed eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also make sure that patients wear transparent face masks or goggles while working.
In the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for keeping a patient away.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, China should have taken high caution based on deep recollection of the 2003 SARS outbreak, according to a report dated 7 January 2020.
However, prior to 19 January 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control had reassured the citizens that the novel virus is less contagious and limited in human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly eased public fears, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival and significant time was wasted in Wuhan to minimise the disease.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this tough lesson and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements as every word will be considered by citizens and it may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unwanted information from clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more regulatory to suppress potential epidemics at an early stage rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue frequently targeted and effective practices aimed at increasing public awareness of pandemics and periodically testing and improving the response of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, it has spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of a return of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for pandemic control and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals and women more than younger individuals, and the severity and mortality rates are higher in older individuals than in younger individuals.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus without symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually do so in severe illness, making it much more difficult to control COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more rapidly and more extensively than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients may be positive for the virus again.
These discoveries dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Were there any intermediate species for the transmission of the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively slow the spread of infection and the outbreak could return at any time.
While molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block ACE2-receptor cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot get a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus genetically multiply during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, a death like SARS, or a recurrence like the swine flu sometime in the future?
It is essential, but it takes some time to find the answers to these and many other questions.
But whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humankind, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the coin upside down to reveal just how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the forefront of discussion and surprised us by showing a higher transmissibility and lower pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic source of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Intermediate host bases for some HCoVs have also been reported.
Animal nutrient detection has a direct impact on human immunity.
Investigating CoV-host exchange in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their animal origin and inter-related transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic was discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful hospice replacement and the effects of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV-s) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which consists of a group of coiled, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"Hosting the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases of RNA viruses, these viruses were dubbed ""CoV"" due to their crown-like anatomy under the electron microscope".
Structurally, CoVs have integral genomes that are of the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
The polyproteins are processed to produce 16 more non-structural proteins, which are named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including the key (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Several lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV gene contains most HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Ethnological evidence has shown that bats and mice serve as the gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary bases for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have steadily crossed the interspecies barrier and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoV-types) have been identified.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively large number of patients with highly pathogenic, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a high probability of expression outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that transmission of HCoVs was generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and with a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak continues to plague the Arabian Peninsula and spread disproportionately to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the active agent of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal origins from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The search for animal origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the causes of natural history, driving forces, and species-to-species hopping limitations.
It may guide or direct the search for the origin, intermediate and extender animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future spillover.
In this review, we present a summary of animal sources, inter-species transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we would like to draw attention to this general context and discuss that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally pathogenic in their natural host base but become pathogenic when they enter the body of a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoVs where pathogenicity often declines with increased transmissibility.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoV-sets were collected in various infected animals including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs before the first collection of B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from nasal secretions of common cold patients.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced common cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, nausea, and sore throat, and fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was extracted from organ culture and subsequently repeated growth of the virus in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished markedly from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally widespread and are transmitted mainly in winter climates during the tropical season.
Typically, the onset of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common colds.
Only a few immunosuppressive patients were found to have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first documented AMBV-caused pandemic in human history, and its causal agent was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV".
The first case of SARS was detected in Guangdong province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across many countries and continents, with 774 deaths.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could increase the incubation period by about two incidental cases, with incubation periods of 4 to 7 days and showing final signs of viral load as the 10th day of illness approaches.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, respiratory distress, cough and respiratory distress are seen as delayed symptoms, primarily with muscle aches, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In SARS patients, there is also a marked loss of the dissociated alveoli, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may become infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine disruption that can be especially fatal in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an indicator patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially prevalent among young children, the elderly and respiratory illness patients with low immunity.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 include cholera, eye irritation, fever, and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is identified as causing about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and has the highest incidence in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to hereditary-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
HCoV-HKU1, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been found globally, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four strain-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause high pathogenic disease, although there have been accidents for unknown reasons, such as the rare case of a highly pathogenic subtype of HCoV-NL63 that recently caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs have the ability to functionally transmit and persist in humans, they become relatively less harmful or contagious.
MERS-CoV was first collected in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and rations in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, out-of-state cases have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary spread to close contacts.
In 2015, another second-stage outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
Characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, the diagnostic manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal impairment, which is unique among HCoV-caused diseases in the case of MERS.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach diseases such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed a mortality rate of over 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses to the human body.
In mid to late December 2019, classes of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as being case-related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death rate of roughly 3.4%.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, compared to 1.2%, outside of the country.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in different branches of the ethnogenesis tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the time of the pathogen's onset and the duration of the HCoV disease course are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is mediated by SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) that are transmitted in the population.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection displays characteristics that are typically seen during infection of community-acquired HCoVs with non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show signs of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection cluster shows interesting characteristics of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the cohort-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 has reduced transmissibility after human transmission as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether SARS-CoV-2's fecal-oral infection plays a role in at least some circumstances, such as SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is of particular interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 shows the same seasonality as community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission, will influence the outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four strains of mildly symptomatic family-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of the primitive HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and those that have developed serious HCoV disease in humans have been killed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to accumulate adaptive mutations that fight host-boundary factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance of it being fully adapted to humans.
If adapted well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four strain-acquired CoVs have been spreading in the human population, triggering the common cold-cough among immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not need any animal basis.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and cannot sustain transmission to humans.
They need to be maintained and spread to zoonotic bases and possibly to potential human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifier carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least so far, it is as highly transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than the family-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts to humans and spreads to humans without any intermediate host or animal.
Before discussing the animal source of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, basal, intermediate and modifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoVs if it harbours a closely related ancestor by sharing superior homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The parent virus usually adapts well to the host and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, an Aadhaar host provides HCoVs with shelter continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infectious and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs are newly introduced to an intermediate host before or in the immediate vicinity of human exposure, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and act as an amplifier host in temporarily replicating the virus and then expanding the range of human infection through its transmission to the human body.
If HCoVs cannot sustain transmission between intermediate hosts, transmission may be halted.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and initiate long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate is the natural base.
Epidemiological data traditionally revealed that there was a history of contact with prey animals with indicative cases of SARS.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that there were higher outbreaks of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than among the general population.
A raccoon dog in the scenthound (Pyguma larvata) and live animal markets was first identified to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the stink bugs were killed in the markets.
However, it was reported that masked palm civets from wild or farmed areas without exposure to live animal markets were basically negative for SARS CoV, indicating that masked palm scented pods would serve only as intermediate amplifier hosts but not as the natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of the different animal species in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals could also act as intermediate amplifier carriers for SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
These are all thought to be one-way carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent investigation of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinelophus Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horseshoe bat. Subsequent investigation has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinelophus Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoV-series share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats provide shelter for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV-types) have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as viable viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from bat stool samples was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serums of recovering SARS patients were able to inactivate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high degree of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not the immediate parental virus and that bats are not the immediate primary host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analyses classify MERS-CoVs as Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5 in the same class.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoVs are phylogenetically close to those of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that single-celled camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV specific inhibitory antibodies, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was collected from the nasal swab of a conch-tailed camel, further suggesting that the camel acts as the true base carrier of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have been shown to have a high incidence of viral shedding, although usually with mild symptoms.
Significantly, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the anal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS before the onset of symptoms had no history of contact with camels, possibly human-to-human transmission or transmission pathways associated with any unknown animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
Bat CoV RaTG13 collected from Rhinolophus affinis bat has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to determine parental relationship.
This means that bats may not be the direct base carriers of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-uniform bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Hunan seafood wholesale market, with which the early many cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as bonrhui (Manis javanica) may also carry SARS-CoV-2 related pathogenic beta-CoVs.
The nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% of these novel BonRui CoV genomes is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
However, with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences, they are equally bound to RaTG13.
They cluster into two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the ethnogenesis tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 by identifying a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more distorted, although the sequence homology is genome-wide to a higher degree.
An earlier study on ill Bonrue also reported the detection of continuous sequences of virus from lung samples, which were shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various assembly methods and manual presentation to generate partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct Bonrui origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence separation between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrui SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrui SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV-clusters.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is not yet established.
While most sequence homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrue's RBDs, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, share the most genome-specific sequence homology.
It is highly promising that the RBD-related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 in Bonrue are driven by high similarity selectivity-mediated recessive evolution between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
A counter-proposal in favour of recombination between a Bonrui SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination between beta-CoVs is widespread.
The exact animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylegenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat CoV, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), detected in North American tricolored bats has been reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, was genetically related to another bat CoV, Hipposideros/Ghanacovam/19/2008, although comeleids are also suspected as intermediate carriers.
For clarity, the animal sources of known HCoV-groups are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnological analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events of CoVs in history.
A respiratory epidemic was observed in the 1890s when HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an Alpaca-alpha CoV.
Several pieces of evidence support transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, the shared ecological environment may be from bat contact with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated bats are diverse and non-pathogenic among the bat alpha-CoVs, while alpaca causes respiratory disease outbreaks in animals infected with alpha-CoV.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas may acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not too surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool for HCoV-229E, while alpacas and one-horned camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as MERS-CoV does.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the transmission of interspecies transmission from bats to a camel and from a camel to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection and further confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic material and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, nesting colonies, close social interaction and strong flight capabilities are the conditions for bats to be ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was first detected decades ago in a camel with a conch.
It adapts well to these camels which have gone from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural base shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of transmission in these animals.
The spread of MERS-CoV to humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge for MERS-CoV because it cannot be contained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV infection, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic among pangolins.
They may be the last host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs similar to the scented cockroach in the case of SARS-CoV.
The potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cross-species transmission from animals to humans may need to be included or eliminated in future studies.
First, bats may be the host base of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, Bonroux may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected by biting and eating the flesh of prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals has been confirmed for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
Animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being investigated.
In addition to the various animal hosts, three main factors of viral side are also important in helping CoVs to cross the interspecies barrier.
First, their relative high rate of mutation in RNA replicates.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV-clusters can be considered to be ""medium"" to ""high"" depending on the decade of CoV adaptation of the novel carrier, and the average replacement rate is ~10-4 replacements per year per site".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, whose elimination results in extremely high variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to form CoV replicas by attenuating exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 components being tested in diagnostic trials.
Yet, the transmission rates of CoV-groups are almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, when CoVs do not adapt well to the host, the rate of mutation is often high.
Compared to SARS-CoVs with higher mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate, indicating a more adaptable human.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host nearby to humans.
As well as SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a bumblebee camel.
In theory, the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely to quickly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective.
Second, the large RNA of CoVs uses extra flexibility in genome mutation for mutation and recombination, increasing the possibility of evolution with interlinkages, which are favorable for the emergence of CoV-clusters when conditions become favourable.
It is supported by a large number of unique encoded open-reading frames and protein functions at the 3′ edge of the genome.
"Third, CoVs change templates when replicating RNA, randomly and often through a unique ""copy-like"" process".
Strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA replication in the host mixing vessel.
Highly homologous full length and subgenome-specific RNAs can recombine to form new CoVs.
Phyllogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found between both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Viral-host interaction related to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Among them, the recombination of SARS-CoV was taken as a model example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies transmission occurred.
Based on comparative analysis between human and olfactory SARS-CoV-clusters, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to rapidly adapt to mutations of RBD in various hosts, especially S proteins.
Typically a CoV interacts with the RBD cellular receptor on the S protein and is highly selective by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment which binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been shown to be distinct from odorless viral isolates in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in receptor-focused designs to interact with ACE2 receptors.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD has K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the frequency of spike protein exchange with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be critical for the viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are homologous.
The 30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that the binding tendencies of its S protein to ACE2 in humans may be altered.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10 to 20-fold higher binding tendencies than the one between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine whether other co-receptors may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Concerningly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopoptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after they have been transmitted from their animal hosts to the interspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcomes of HCoV-group interspecies transmission are also driven by factors of host dependence and restriction.
The separation of these host proteins between humans and the natural host hosts of HCoVs such as bats, a camel and mice can inhibit interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must capture host-dependent factors and destroy host-restrictive factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this case, identifying and characterizing the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interactions remains to be done.
A neutral genome-wide screening of host dependence and restriction for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR could be beneficial.
The emergence of novel HCoVs: Back to where it started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample scope for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to drastically modify acquired or lost viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV adnexa, ORF8 has been found to be important in human adaptation because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but have been found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide-deleting feature of SARS-CoVs was found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This cleavage splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and appears to be an adapted mutation that encourages shelter switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where a large number of small recombination regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Reassembly locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV went through a re-combination event between different strains, which occurred in a camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs cause recombination with CoVs from other animals in genes that do not constitute them.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly resulting in the release of viruses from selective stresses such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to bi-nucleotide removal.
Although intact ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, Alpaca alpha-CoV appears to be embedded inside a single nucleotide, with consequences seen in frameshift.
But last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures on their underlying strains.
When bats were infected with CoV they were asymptomatic or they only detected mild symptoms, indicating mutual adaptation between CoV-complexes and bats.
Bats have been shown to adapt well to CoVs both in terms of origin and physiology.
For example, in bats, defects in response activation to inflammation effectively reduce CoV-mediated pathology.
In addition, the activity of the bat's natural killer cells is suppressed due to the low expression levels of the suppressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by bat's high metabolic activity can both suppress CoV replication and affect proofreading by exoribonucleases, thus providing the selective pressure needed to produce strains of the virus when exposed to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, the possibility of three new HCoVs emerging in the last two decades is not a coincidence.
CoVs cause mild symptoms in non-pathogenic or their host hosts such as bats and camels.
They grow solid without a strong resistance response from the host.
This is the secret to why asymptomatic vectors are seen and what causes serious human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was isolated from the CoV counterpart.
The same technique of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Also, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, NLRP3 anti-inflammatory agents including MCC950 may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common factors by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were raised.
A bat beta-CoV was found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while a bat-CoV also shared 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although marketed scentholes and other animals have been reported to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Unusually homologous BNR beta-CoVs have been found with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that BNRs may act as one of the intermediate hosts or BNR beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragmentation to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either intentionally or accidentally synthesized.
CoVs have once again come into focus due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal sources and animal bases of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and mosquitoes in markets, killing mosquitoes there by shutting down wet markets could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal transmission in light of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, what and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through bats and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a single-celled camel for a long time.
Besides being an important means of transportation, these camels serve as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife market in China to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
We cannot eliminate these viruses, which could lead to new genotypes.
Many types of animal CoVs are circulating in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are highly diverse.
There is a high potential for these zoonotic CoVs to multiply and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the onset of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparedness and response plan.
Many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They stay on their own natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chances of human exposure to bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecosystem of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural basis of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to Bonrue, it will be seen under what circumstances bats and Bonrue may share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be undertaken.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 6th February 2020, our team released a Rapid Advisory Guideline for the detection and treatment of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline has added to our experience and made a good reference for the fight against the pandemic globally.
However, as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided a brand new diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases, in line with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out, which has been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a Rapid Advisory Guidance and published it online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has received a huge response.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines on COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, in a total of seven editions, each with some substantial changes in content.
Now Zhou and his colleagues have commented on our guidelines, suggesting a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also provided valuable reference for the global pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank their remarkable work.
However, their work should also be updated to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (trial version 7) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical prerequisites with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics, or three clinical prerequisites if there is no clear epidemiological history.
Epidemiological history: (1) residents of or travel history to Wuhan city and its surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive on nucleic acid test); (3) a history of exposure to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city or surrounding areas, or other communities where confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of exposure to Gush (small areas such as homes, offices, schools, etc. within 2 weeks and fever/respiratory infection ≥ 2 kB).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts at the early onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of onset of lymph.
For a confirmed case-by-case diagnosis, there should be either of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive on a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic real-time PCR test; (2) high homogeneity or similarity to the novel coronavirus known in full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) positive on SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody in serum testing; or positive on a variant of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody negative, and ≥4 times the suspicion stage of normal and severe growth.
We have seen that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions have included respiratory nucleic acid detection real time PCR testing and blood samples.
Pathogenicity detection of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the researchers' ongoing work that rapidly searches for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for blood samples including respiratory tract samples, which increases the availability of different samples and which helps bring specific antibody positive results to the confirmed standard.
Moreover, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to be cautious about patients with irregular symptoms and those without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou and colleagues should update the flow list, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in subsequent clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
To diagnose suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend identifying them and following the most up-to-date guidelines in your country.
Our team will update our guidelines in a timely manner to assist.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 as the highest daily.
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day yesterday.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, Bangladesh Institute of Pathology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjadhi, two of the cases are over 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60 years old and one is 41-50 years old.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told local news agency Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Kadir said that public transport will remain closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The public transport shutdown started on 26th March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4th April.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Bangladesh on 8th March, in two individuals and the spouse of one of them, who had returned from Italy.
As of March 19, all three have recovered so far.
SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide have exceeded one million
Johns Hopkins University data indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide on Thursday exceeded one million.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to the coronavirus disease, COVID-19.
The landmark event occurred on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed that it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the WHO has documented 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours on 4 April at 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths linked.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 people in the United States have died from coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries announced tougher measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments will continue even if Russians do not go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, ten against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day; previous curfews were only in effect from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand had planned to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Shops in Australia lower the limit of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the limit on the purchase of toilet paper per transaction to two and one packages, respectively, at all stores nationwide.
Also, on Saturday ALDI introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were posted as messages at checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Shopping was reportedly stockpiled for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited sales of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes follow the four-pack limitation following the previous transaction that Woolworths and Coles launched on March 4 and 5 respectively.
"On March 8, Coles announced via a campaign that the four-pack ban had been introduced in several places, but that ""many stores were still selling out within an hour of supply"", describing the demand as ""unprecedented"" and in a Facebook post on Tuesday at ALDI they described it as ""unexpected"".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales rose sharply last week.
Costco's store in Canberra was also cleared for two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the rate of supply recurrence, Woolworths orders additional stock, with ALDI making stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery make it difficult.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after the previously unstocked, some stores could not handle the Wednesday special sale.
In a News.com.au report, retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology said that stores replenish their inventory every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy substance which makes it very scarce in stock and when it is sold out, huge shelves are empty, further reinforcing the feeling of scarcity.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths thought that if he had lots of stuff, and he could [buy] things like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and he had enough, maybe he could reduce that fear", Russell Zimmerman said".
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Hu Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes Clinex toilet tissue and the solarium paper that makes the sorbent, insists that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, some of which were due to buyers having a long weekend off on Labor Day.
In this Thursday edition of the NT News, printed daily in Darwin, an eight-page supplement is given to cut the pieces and use them as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on 3 March said that shops were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on their shopping.
Russell Zimmerman also said that there is a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the sale of used toilet paper at the online British supermarket Okado is limited to two 12-roll packs every Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - a pandemic.
"While the term "pandemic" does not refer to the seriousness of specific cases but to the extent to which any disease has spread, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic".
"WHO Secretary General Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that if states can identify, " "test, treat, isolate, identify and integrate".
"We are deeply concerned by both the spread and alarming levels of severity and the alarming levels of inactivity".
"The global pandemic is ""unprecedented"", according to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention".
"In a February CNN commentary, he said, ""Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked continuously since its emergence in the world"."
Gebrassas also expressed the same opinion, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
"And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new status as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said of the outbreak, ""In fact, it's going to get worse"."
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000 resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and Union Territories resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The Chinese case fatality rate is estimated at 4%, while the global rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your face while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control and closing facilities.
The global pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, cancelled sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and increased supply shortages due to fearful shopping.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people, and others from areas where significant cases of the virus have been found, based on race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions levels have decreased.
In Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), health authorities reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and thus the virus is thought to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the Bonrui coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The person who first reported symptoms was later reported to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019; and the person subsequently had no visible connection to the wet market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unverified report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case found to be of origin on 17 November 2019 may have been the first, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had reportedly declined, but had increased abruptly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had for the first time overtaken the number of new cases inside China.
The number of cases may have been underestimated, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of them under 19 years of age and 2.4% of those worldwide.Patrick Valens, Chief Scientific Adviser to the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population will need to be infected before the functional population can develop immunity.
According to the official protocol, the case refers to the number of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had formalised a policy of not testing only those with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China were undetected and that unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official estimate.
The initial estimate of the normal reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is likely 5.7.
Most people who get COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the interval from onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common interval being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths in China were people over 60 years of age, and 75% of them had pre-existing conditions including heart disease and diabetes.
The number of deaths resulting from COVID-19 may be much higher, as this may not include people who die without testing - such as in homes, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy suggest that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted ""We know that [the reported death toll] is a lower estimate than the actual number"", a statement that was corroborated by reports that were not based on data from the United States. Such underestimations are common in global pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica. Several methods are used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death-to-case ratio as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio has decreased from 17.3% (of those with symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (of those with symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other preventive measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which expresses the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation above this range is consistent with a statistical study of the first allopathic test of COVID-19 in Germany and the analysis of the test's impact on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the epidemic can be controlled.
The maximum and final timing of outbreaks are uncertain and may vary by location.
"Machieze Bonney of Penn State University said, ""When left untested, infectious strains usually dominate and then begin to decay when the disease no longer has a host".
But at the moment it is almost impossible to project any judgment on when that will happen.
"Zhang Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries could come together to follow the World Health Organization's advice to stop the spread of the virus, ""it could be over by June"".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""will probably continue to spread for a year or two"."
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, ""physical distancing and other measures are needed until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more) """.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's highly unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so contagious, will disappear completely", and that it "could become a seasonal disease, coming back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Relatively uncommon symptoms include restlessness, shortness of breath, loss of smell, shortness of breath, pain at the junction of muscles and bones, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coffee spit, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, wakefulness, and bluish facial or lip, which are all urgent symptoms; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic without clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers recommend that those who have been in contact with confirmed infected persons should also be monitored and tested to avoid infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratios range from few to 44%.
The incubation period (the period during which infection and symptoms occur) ranges from one to 14 days; the incubation period is five days. In the case of uncertainty, the fraction of individuals with COVID-19 who initially had a scent louse accounts for 30% and those who subsequently had a louse accounts for 15%.
Some details on how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is thought to be spread primarily by contact and small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact means being between 1 and 2 meters (3 and 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a cough can cause a drop of water from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets of fluid that may be produced when talking and that remain in the air for a long time. Respiratory laryngitis can also be produced during exhalation, including when talking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Water cells can enter the mouth or nose of those who are nearby or they can enter the lungs through respiration.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory discharge to become aerosol and consequently spread through the air.
It can also be spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the stool, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the mouth through feces. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it can be transmitted before and after symptoms.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission may occur before any significant symptoms appear.
There have been few reports of lab-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person typically infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus is found in plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, cardboard for one day and copper for four hours for up to three days.
This varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as infected people do after touching other surfaces.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap as it breaks the protective opening of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be the source of some animal-borne disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically co-infected with the strain from two bats in the genus Betacoronavirus in the subgenus Cerbecovirus (Line B).
The complete genome layer of the BatCov RaTG13 samples is 96% identical.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in Bonnruis and the virus in humans differed in certain parts of the genome sequence by only one amino acid.
A comparison of the entire genome to date has found a 92% genetic similarity between the Bonrui coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 at very high levels, which is insufficient to prove that Bonrui acted as the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily depending on symptoms, but is ultimately confirmed by reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected red cells.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging properties are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis"."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within hours to days.
Usually this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for long-range use.
The serological test, manufactured by Chelex in the US, was approved for use only in authorized laboratories in case of emergency.
Characteristics of radiographs and computed tomography (CT) imaging of people with symptoms include opaque peripheral ground glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from tests of confirmed cases.
Imaging and detection of COVID-19 without any confirmation by PCR for mixing with other infections such as adenovirus is restricted.
A large study in China compared PCR with chest CT results and explained that while imaging of the infection is now less precise, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests considering it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based transmutation birth control has been developed which can produce viral characteristics through radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing into tissue and throwing the tissue directly in a garbage can.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures were also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments advised against or restricted all non-essential travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of mass transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers who care for someone who may be infected are recommended to use evidence warnings, contact warnings and eye protection. It is important for health authorities to find out who has been in contact to determine a source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The administration's use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issued a statement calling for such surveillance to be limited.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log one user's proximity to others' mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they come into contact with someone who is positive for COVID-19.There are many misconceptions about how to prevent the infection, such as that washing the inside of the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water occasionally for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; before flushing, coughing, or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the virus can be killed with household soap, which breaks the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available, at least 60% alcohol should be used instead.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (within one minute of contact with disinfectant on stainless steel surfaces), including 62%-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and clohexidine gluconate are comparatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an area such as an office or daycare, offices, bathrooms, public spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their face and nose over when coughing or sneezing or cover the tissue with tissue paper and dispose of the tissue properly as soon as possible.
People at risk of infection are advised to wear surgical masks.Wearing a mask can help control the amount of water released during talking, sneezing or coughing and the extent of spread.
WHO has issued a guideline on when and how to wear masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene"." The use of masks is also recommended for those who care for people who may have the disease".
WHO advises healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their own faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the public to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends that healthy members of the public use disposable medical masks, especially when in close proximity to other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask while travelling on public transport or in public places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is illegal to go out without a mask or a mask.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has issued an order that a face mask is required when entering every grocery store.
Israel has urged all its residents to wear masks when going out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about 10 million masks per day since mid-March, will require passengers to wear face masks on trains and interstate buses for travel from April 1.
Panama has made masks mandatory when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy masks wear homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) also includes controlling the spread of infection by reducing close contact between individuals and slowing the rate of disease spread.
The measures include: quarantining; restricting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can implement social distancing practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or advising social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the gathering, as advised by US government authorities and health agencies, quickly dropped from 250 people (if COVID-19 is not known to be spreading in the area) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and impaired immunity are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and in areas of outbreak in the community the CDC advised them to stay at home as much as possible. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the phrase ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", explaining that the goal is to maintain social contact via virtual means or distance".
"The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact that has led to complete social isolation rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others in alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during pandemics".
This included the advice to only have sex with someone who lives with you, who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who are infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they have been infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infection are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
The strategies for controlling any outbreak are containment and containment.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak, and other measures of infection control are initiated and vaccinated, in addition to identifying and isolating infected people to stop the spread of the disease in the remaining population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and society.
A mixed standard of both containment and mitigation may have to be adopted at the same time.
More extreme measures of containment are needed to reverse the epidemic cycle by reducing the initial reproduction rate to less than 1. Reducing the epidemic maximum is part of the response to an outbreak of an infectious disease, known as epidemic curve levelling.
This reduces the risk of healthcare emergence and gives more time for vaccination and treatment to be improved.
Other ways the outbreak could be controlled other than medication include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; acknowledging such other ways and engaging the public to participate; as well as environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a series of standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and local quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the manufacture of face masks and increased fines for medical supplies fraud. The pretence of efforts by Great Britain and the United States proves that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (increasing the response to the epidemic) are major challenges.
While the most desirable eradication policies could reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, health systems are still being crippled with millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred course of action but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), as measures are relaxed or the virus will return rapidly.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic damage.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop and test existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold-cough medications, drinking fluids, and resting may alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the illness, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory assistance may be required.
Steroid use can have worse results.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO further stated that some traditional and home remedies help to alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and the acquisition of health centres for COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a preventive measure to contain the outbreak of the disease in the first place.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care delivery centres to remove sources at multiple levels, including increasing laboratory surveillance for testing for COVID-19, increasing the number of intensive monitoring by isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and increasing the number of ventilation and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of them were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or in other words, it has an animal source. A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus"".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was bribed by his senior staff for raising concerns.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Wuhan has reported a number of unidentified pneumonia cases that are under investigation since early January. At the early stage of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China stated that about 140 new cases were detected in one day, including two people from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
The next official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people already had symptoms.As of March 26, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, overtaking China and Italy.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There was at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
In Europe, due to the pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as quarantining everyone (a stay-at-home order or an order to seek shelter somewhere, or lockout) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are under lockdown.

COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on 20th January 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely blamed on the new religious movement of the Dayagu, known as the Shincheonji Church of the Jews.
Visitors to the Shinchangi Church from Wuhan who had come to make pilgrimages to Daegu were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, 1,261 of the Church's 9,336 followers, or about 13%, reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.

The airline's schedule was also affected and so it was changed.South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people and track and quarantine those they came into contact with, which is considered one of the largest and best organized programs in the world.
Screening methods include self-reporting of symptoms in new international arrivals through mobile apps, drive-through testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people daily.
Despite not fully quarantining cities, the program in South Korea has been seen as a successful measure to contain the outbreak.South Korean society was first polarized in response to the crisis by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either claiming the outbreak has been officially abused and calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.

However, the United States has been testing very slowly, which has led to the actual number of infections being trapped by smoke during the outbreak.
The testing was hampered by the lack of state government approval on defective test kits produced by the state government in February and private test kits (education centres, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and the regulatory eligibility that people had to qualify for a test until early March (a doctor's order was required from then on).

"On 23 January, in response to the decision by central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gaden Galle commented that ""WHO definitely did not recommend this"", and that it was ""a very important indication of the commitment to contain the global epidemic in the place where its concentration is highest"", calling it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"".On 30 January, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and increasing the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth since the first declaration of the PHEIC in 2009 during the Sino-Flu pandemic".
"The WHO Director-General said that the reason for PHEIC was ""the risk of global spread is higher in low and middle income countries where there are no advanced medical facilities".
"In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that ""there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and business"" and also said that ""WHO does not recommend restricting business and movement"."

Some critics believe that the move is to protect the Chinese Communist Party's General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, denied an earlier admission that the coronavirus outbreak first started in Wuhan, denying the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
"The Donald Trump administration in the US has referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"" saying that China's ""censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which some critics have criticized in response as racism and ""an attempt to distract from his administration's failure to contain the disease"".
"The Daily Beast received a statement about the US government's conduct that outlined a communication strategy with credible sources at the National Security Council, where the strategy was cited as "all about China".

"This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
"An anonymous ""high-level political source"" quoted in the Italian newspaper La Stampa as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""useless or of little use to Italy"".
"The source accused Russia of embarking on a campaign to please it ""geopolitically and diplomatically"".
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi De Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying that the United States imposing sanctions on Iran made it difficult for his country to fight the outbreak due to its lack of access to international markets. The outbreak has urged the United States to adopt common social policies, including universal health care, universal childcare, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health in other affluent countries.
Political analysts speculated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"After announcing that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined in government-designated places for two weeks by Japan, South Korea criticized Japan's ""obscure and passive quarantine efforts"".
South Korean society was initially on two opposing sides in President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon to be sacked, while others praised her response, claiming the government mismanaged the outbreak. The global pandemic has given many countries the opportunity to enact emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow the government to further entrench their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament gives Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the power to issue decrees to govern indefinitely, suspend parliament or conduct elections, and punish dignitaries who spread misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and how the government is dealing with the crisis.
The outbreak was blamed on supply shortages, increased global use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, panic and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.

The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electrical products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has increased the prices by 20 times and delayed the delivery of medical supplies by six months.

The pandemic in Australia has given Daegu retailers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity led to inadequate baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both areas have had to free themselves from severe food shortages, ensuring over-demand for food.
Measures by China and Italy against the stockpiling of essential goods and illicit trade have been successful, which avoided the severe food shortages that were projected in Europe but also in North America.
Although there is no significant decline in agricultural products in northern Italy, industry representatives say prices could rise.
When Chinese government officials released stored pork to provide adequate nutrition to the population, even in Wuhan they initially faced empty food shelves.
Italy has a similar national law that requires food producers to stockpile food for such emergencies.

The stock market fell again due to the coronavirus, with the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider the possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Mohammad El-Arian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the Central Bank and the State.
Central banks are coping faster than they did in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments, with government restrictions on tourism, including all populated places and all travel around the world.
As a result, several airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled flights for relatively low demand, as British regional airline Flybe crashed.
The devastating impact on the cruise industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The Chinese New Year holiday marks the start of the main tourist season in China, called Chun'an, which is when the pandemic began in China.
Many events where crowds can be large, such as the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, have been closed by national and regional governments. Private companies are also closing their stores on their own and have closed down various tourist attractions such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year celebrations and tourist gatherings, including the Forbidden City and the Traditional Temple Fair, have been cancelled in Beijing to prevent crowds.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has maximised its contagious disease response and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced or temporary closures in store opening hours.
In Europe and Latin America, store visits fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60% drop.
As a result, the number of shoppers in shopping centres decreased by 3343% in March compared to February.
Global shopping mall operators imposed additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers' temperatures, and canceling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession that began due to the global pandemic could have pushed 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty in Latin America than the situation would have been had it not been for the global pandemic.
In Wuhan, in January and February 2020, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs at the peak of the epidemic.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in the inland or stranded in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance in March 2020.
According to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates reaching 32%. In India, the lockdown has resulted in the loss of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid per day). A survey by the Angus Red Institute found that 44% of Canadian families are suffering from some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their employees on a government-subsidized short-term work scheme known as Kurtzarbeits.
The German short-time work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations as well as individuals - both employed and self-employed - globally.
Institutions in the arts and culture sector sought to maintain their (often government-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage in the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and at various levels have closed indefinitely by cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events and performances.
In response, intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms have been underway. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week in Rome, the final week of the Christian Lent season.
Many dioceses have advised elderly Christians to stay home rather than coming on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television, and others are holding services without getting out of the car.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square being empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities have also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurudwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and religious sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disaster in the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season have either been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event ""will not take place after the summer of 2021 unless rescheduled for any date after 2020". Casinos and other gaming venues worldwide remain closed, and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled".
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups to gambling sites suggest that this has led to a shift in online gamblers. With various bands suspending or cancelling tours of the waters, the entertainment industry has also been hit.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live events, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" where artists could perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, the fire has spread in a coronavirus-themed internet meme that is both ridiculous and distracting from this uncertain time.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, unwarranted fear of foreigners and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there are reports of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports of cases since February have documented racist attitudes towards different groups of Chinese people around the world, where they claimed they were worthy of the virus or what was being done to them as just retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was support for people in the virus-hit areas.
The people of Italy, experiencing the horrors of the COVID-19 outbreak as the outbreak progresses in new hotspot countries, may be susceptible to suspicion and xenophobia as the first country in Europe to experience the horrors. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions/petitions to seek a ban on Chinese people entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseRajaJapan was very popular.
There are reports of increasing levels of racial abuse and attacks against Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and US.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", as critics see the phrase as racist and anti-Chinese".
Ukrainian protesters attack buses carrying Ukrainian residents and returning foreigners from Wuhan to Nabi Sanzhahari.
Students from North-East India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dileep Ghosh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God has taken revenge on them".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata has sharply criticized the comments in Kolkata and called them "misguided". Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China has increased further during the pandemic. Here, foreigners are described as "foreign garbage" and are marked for disposal.
There are other newspapers including Paywall that have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many publications have produced scientific papers related to the outbreak that are available in open access.
Some scientists are in favour of publishing their results quickly on some innovative servers like Biorex.
Emerging infectious diseases are infectious diseases of emerging pathogens, which are often novel in their range of outbreaks or modes of transmission.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to report or who were asymptomatic.
The results of the test can be used to determine an accurate mortality rate and group immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests performed across countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the mortality rate in reported cases, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples, can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR test performed with throat swab is reliable only in the first week of illness.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but may continue to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested at week 2, samples may then be taken from deep in the respiratory tract by a suction catheter, or a cough-induced discharge (sneezing) may be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the common ""E"" gene present in all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene, which is characteristic of SARS-CoV-2". In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time diagnostic RT-PCR panel to public health labs through international reagent resources".
One of three genetic tests of older versions of the test kits resulted in unresolved results due to defective reagents and a trial interruption at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples being successfully processed on average per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not determined reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on 9th March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced; sampling and processing must be performed as required by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in as little as 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization ( EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a trial on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 Cepheid similarly received an EUA from the FDA for a trial, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require periodic temperature cycles, the method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the US, and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can give results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like a rapid influenza test.
"A March 2020 literature review concluded that ""the importance of chest radiography in the early stages is very low in terms of diagnosis, but data from CT [computed tomography] may be present even before the onset of symptoms"."
The features of CT include a bi-lateral, multilobar ground-glass opacity with a marginal, unbound and backward distribution.
Subplural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation occur with the onset of the disease.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the epicenter of the current epidemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for screening for COVID-19 or for diagnosis""". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in humans, to assess immunity and to monitor the population from the 7th day of onset of symptoms. Evaluations can be performed by central laboratories (CLTs) and point-of-care testing (PoCTs).
High performance automated systems will be able to perform this assay in many essential laboratories, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of marginal blood is typically used for CLT, although sequential samples can also be used to track immune responses.
A single sample of blood is usually taken by piercing the skin for PoCT.
A pre-screening step is not required for testing like the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 institutions that provided the agency with notification as required and are therefore now able to deliver their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use approval. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits at the end of March 2020, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test is capable of hundreds of samples in a few hours, and therefore much faster than traditional PCR evaluation of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that none of the antibody test kits they bought were good enough to use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, return it and get the test results shortly after. The British NHS has announced that they are launching a scheme on a trial basis to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting other people if the patient goes to a hospital, or if the ambulance is used to disinfect it. A healthcare professional uses appropriate precautions in the drive-through test to eliminate suspected cases of COVID-19".
The drive-through centers helped South Korea to have the fastest, most extensive testing of any country. The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have the capacity to do about 12,000 tests per day in a mobile setting, and tested 10,700 people in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a doctor, the health insurance covers the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, drive-in tests were offered in many major cities.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the 12/2020 calendar week, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method to aggregate samples from 64 patients together, and further testing was done only if the aggregate samples were found positive. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary 2000 square meter emergency detection lab called ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye in Bengal"), which could process more than 10,000 samples in one day".
The supervision of the construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and modeling of the completion within 5 days showed that the testing capacity would have increased by 47% in Hubei and the associated cost of quarantine management would have doubled.
Huo-Yan labs in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory.
The test capacity was 50,000 per day as of 4 March 2020. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, the lack of reagents and inadequate supplies were a limitation to mass testing in the European Union and the UK and US.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for subsequent testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country and is on track to increase the testing dose to reach a larger portion of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capability and a population-scale production laboratory purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to operate outside China.
Testing systems targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The German system of producing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits was adopted by the WHO.
The German system was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying testing available in the US. There were problems between China and the US over the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and to meet testing recommendations by health experts.
In contrast, experts say that increased testing in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has been building up testing capabilities in private sector labs for years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased demand for testing due to the widespread transmission of the virus has created millions of testing backlogs in private US labs, and pressures on the supply of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
"In the United States, the test kits prepared by the CDC had ""error""s; then the administration removed the bureaucratic obstacles that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be erroneous".
The agency explained that the incorrect results could result from failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits it purchased from China the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovič proposed throwing them in the Danube. Turkish Health Ministry's Ateş Kara said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a ""high rate of defects"" and they ""did not use them"". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable".
Testing and then quarantining those who tested positive and tracking those who came into contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people resulted in positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Va, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of testing on a total population of 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all those identified were quarantined.
The new infections have been completely eliminated by controlling the movement of communes.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, through inbound travel controls, testing and quarantining, but without any extreme controls such as forcing restaurants and retail establishments to close, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after a holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries have also aggressively tracked people in contact, through inbound travel controls, testing and quarantining, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more than the number of deaths had much lower death rates, because these countries were probably able to identify patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
"In the chart below, the column ""How many percent of tests are positive"" is influenced by the country's testing policy".
Countries where only hospitalized people are tested will have a higher percentage of positive tests than countries where everything else is equal, regardless of whether people have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of cleaning one's hands with the intent of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route".
People can also contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments of the day when washing hands with soap is important are: before and after urinating, after cleaning the baby's lower abdomen or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can be done with ash.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the toilet that the child has used.
After you have a runny nose, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who care for food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the infant mortality rate during home birth.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing habits may drive short improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce the mortality rate from this disease by almost 50%.
The adoption of handwashing incentives can reduce diarrhea by almost a third, and is comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea. Handwashing with soap is performed as an automatic practice in homes, schools and communities around the world as the single most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the cause of the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, a change to the firm practice of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet could save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cut deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing protects against infectious skin diseases (impetigo) that are spread through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, skin rashes and a condition known as hand eczema, or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times of the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of diarrhoea are: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning the baby's lower abdomen or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent transmission include before and after treating cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or nasal mucus; after touching animal waste or moving an animal; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very rare.
A 2015 handwashing survey in 54 countries found an average of 38.7% of households washing their hands with soap. A 2014 survey found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States had the middle rate of around 77%, and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Several practice changes are now in place to increase handwashing with soap during the crisis.
"The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education".
The key to this program is disinfection twice a year, daily hand washing with soap, daily fluoride tooth brushing.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to the water increases the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce the solubility barrier and increase the solubility.
Water is a poor skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are the constituents of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
The cleaning is done by moderate water flow.
Nitrous soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
The small number of studies that targeted bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is less likely because bacteria are washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""liquid soap that can be controlled without the use of hands is recommended for application"."
There has been a lot of publicity about antibacterial soap among the health conscious public.
No evidence of the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms has been found to date.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which has the ability to resist organisms in high doses.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective ingredients, refined preparations may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, methanol, plant extracts) as pH regulators. A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps containing triclosan-based antibacterial soaps are as effective as those containing triclosan for preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.
The warm water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial weight on the hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rub hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol-based rub, antiseptic hand rub, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
For ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, gel carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) or humicants are mostly made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, prepared together with thick components such as glycerin in liquids or foams.
Adding mixed hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccina, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol Rab Sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application to the hand and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria after 1 minute of application to the hand. Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and relatively less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against Norovirus (or Norvac) type virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to properly dry or wash hands.
Rub the liquid, foam or gel on the front and back of both hands and the middle and end of the fingers for about 30 seconds until it dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands thoroughly with hand sanitizer rub, especially if there is dirt on the hands.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and quick destruction of microbial life; although they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing when soap and water are not available.
If the formula does not include emollients and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening ingredients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or disinfectant detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact rash, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or alcohol-containing substances rarely occurs in alcohol hand rubs.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower incidence of painful tactile dermatitis became an attractive factor.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless materials do not clean the hand's biomaterials, but only disinfect the hands.
Because germs remain on the hands, soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many germs.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and preparation and has done significantly less than alcohol and alcohol rubs in the past.
Very recently, preparations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to maintain stable and exuberant antimicrobial activity after application unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income societies do not have the money to spend on soap and instead use ashes or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but less so than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it could increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
When soap is not available, the WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
Proper handwashing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease infection include the following:
Soak your hands in hot or cold running water.
Water is recommended because a permanent basin may be contaminated, but water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Rub enough soap on the back of the hand, between the fingers and under the fingernails and remove the soap foam by hand.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing is a process of friction that removes germs from the skin and more germs from the skin if it is rubbed for a long time.
Wash thoroughly in the stream.
Washing hands in the pool can re-contaminate.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands are more likely to re-contaminate. The areas that are most likely to be left out are the fingers, wrists, between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives can be developed for hand washing convenience, e.g. pouring water from hanging jars or suitable perforated lawns and/or using ash as needed. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving soaps such as "TP-tap" and other low-cost alternatives".
Tippi-tap is a simple technique where a jug held by a rope and a leg-driven liver and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Proper hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of hand drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
A study produced by the Paper Towel Industry European Tissue Symposium and conducted by the University of Westminster, London, in 2008 compared the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the fingers and 254% on the hand towels.
Drying with jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the average decrease in total bacteria was up to 76% on the fingers and up to 77% on the hand towels. The scientists also tested to demonstrate whether there was a potential for cross-contamination from other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which expels air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow germs from the hands and units and remove potential contamination of washroom users and the washroom environment by up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads the microbe up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. A 2005 study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryers exist, and paper towels have been compared to hand dryers.
In the absence of soap and water during travel, hand sanitizing wipes are an alternative to hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory in the hospital environment long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the efficacy of handwashing (1846).
There are electronic devices that give feedback to remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that using them reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds and using sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to remove foam from each part of the hand.
Fingers should be joined and hands should be rubbed together.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can be present in the water on your hands, it is important to wash the foam thoroughly and wipe it off with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water tap (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This will prevent the hands from getting contaminated again.
"The purpose of hand washing in healthcare environments is to remove disease-causing germs ("germs") and prevent their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing in most medical settings remains unacceptably lacking, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus causing microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection rates by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in the health care sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines by the organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene when regulatory compliance verification is required.
"The World Health Organization has a ""five-minute"" time for hand washing:
After contact with blood/liquid
Before the disinfection, and
"After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "anti-microbial" soap) gives the handwashing material the ability to destroy".
The death may be experienced before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are prevalent. Surgical procedures require a hand scrubbing valve that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washing, disinfected towels for hand drying after washing, and a brush for scrubbing and other disinfecting tools for under-nail cleaning.
All jewelry must be unlocked.
This procedure usually requires 2-6 minutes of washing from hand to elbow.
Long-term (10 minutes) hand rubbing is not required.
During washing, water from the palm of the hand to the elbow must be prevented from flowing back to the palm.
After hand washing, hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use hand antiseptics.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand-washing was achieved from the first 20% washing, and little additional benefit was found when hand-washing repetition was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap resulted in a threefold increase in bacterial infection in food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-washing with alcohol-based solution over a 30-second interval, each showed that alcohol-based hand-wringing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, alcohol-based hand rubs are more effective than soap and water/water in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile germs from hands. This may include hand washing, education of staff and written and oral reminders to staff on the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings.
More research is needed to determine which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities at people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to achieving universal handwashing practices.
For example, while there are cheap alternatives to build handwashing facilities in most rural Africa, there are rarely handwashing taps near every private or public toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate is probably due to deep-seated habits rather than lack of soap or water/water.
Promoting and advising on handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in people's habits.
To work effectively, it needs to be monitored and evaluated.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches at LMICs were effective in hand washing, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap among other hygienic necessities".
By achieving the minimum standards, schools can reach three stars from one to the end.
The installation of handwashing stations can be a part of helping the handwashing campaign that is being run to reduce the disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign that is trying to change habits. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on prevention of DALYs.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is comparatively more cost-effective than other water/sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers in hospitals who have just given birth or wounded soldiers - was recognized by two pioneers of hand hygiene in the early-mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English ""founder of modern nursing"".
Until then, most people believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmus.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne illness and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, in Germany posters with ""proper hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and next to the hand washing sinks in office buildings and airport toilets".
"Such a phrase as "shake hands with the person" means to express one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the matter or to be a partner in the evil".
It originates from the passage in the Bible of Matthew where Pontius Pilate refrains from crucifying Jesus Christ, but through wider use in some English-speaking communities it has become a language expression.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an effort to clear the imaginary stain of madness by expressing her guilt over the crime she committed and for inducing her husband to commit it.
It has also been found that people, when thinking or thinking about immoral acts, are more likely to wash their hands than others and tend to value hand washing devices more.
"In addition, those who are given hand washing after this type of intention are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" activities such as volunteering".
Religions instruct hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water for hand washing but not using soap, is a feature of many religions. Hand washing is part of religious practice, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Judaism Tevilah and Netilath Yadaim, Christianity Lavabo and Islam Ozu. Religions instruct especially healthy hand washing after performing certain activities.
Hand washing after using the toilet is mandatory in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions.
And, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health practices to manage risks to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the work to be done, a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace work
Moderate exposure risks include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but requires frequent or close contact with people who may be infected due to ongoing disease spread in the community at the workplace or international travel.
This includes workers who have public contacts, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some overcrowded retail areas.
In addition to the primary infection prevention measures, risk control measures for the group include ventilation using advanced air filters, sneez guards and personal protective equipment when facing COVID-19 infected persons.
OSHA considers health workers and morgue workers to be at high risk of coming into contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and the risk is increased if these personnel apply aerosol-generating procedures or collect or handle samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients through this process.
Suitable risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure air circulation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment for workplace tasks.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in the workplace can have many impacts.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, to care for others, or because of fear of possible contact.
The type of business can change both in terms of what products are in demand and the way these products are purchased (e.g. shopping at off-peak times or through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, shipping of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with the workplace and work to be done, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community, and personal risk factors of workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also described the controls needed to address those risks and the preparedness plans for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives of the outbreak response include reducing infection amongst the workforce, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and reducing their adverse impact on other organizations in the supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses adopted.
The hazard management hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in the control of occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to work-related policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly fitted as applicable (e.g. respirators), worn consistently and appropriately, inspected, maintained and replaced regularly, and properly opened, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid pollution.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplace workplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplaceworkplacework
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, providing respiratory etiquette including face covering during sneezing and coughing, tissue and garbage disposal, preparing for telecommunication or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and materials, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in keeping employees, customers, interviewers and others safe at work.
Workers who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are advised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, and sick leave policies, which allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, should be relaxed, and staff should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but requires frequent or close contact with people who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 within six feet (1.8 m) due to ongoing disease spread in the community at the workplace or recent international travel to a location where the person has been widely spread with COVID-19.
Administrative controls for these and higher-risk groups include encouraging people to stay at home, replacing face-to-face contact with virtual communication, introducing shifts for different types of exposure, introducing COVID-19 precautions, providing workers with a safe environment and training on how to use safety devices and other protective equipment in places of work, eliminating the risk of COVID-19, providing employees with a safe environment and training on how to respond to the latest COVID-19 events, and providing employees with information about the need to avoid contact with the environment, including the need to avoid contact with people who are sick.
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include keeping sick people at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a staff member to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue when sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to the call of a sick passenger or when touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment should probably be used if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial ships including pleasure ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel if sick, isolating oneself and immediately notifying the ship's medical center if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be in the quarantined person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, regardless of the public transmission of disease, the CDC recommends that if an infected person enters a school building, it be temporarily closed for cleaning or disinfection.
When there is minimal to moderate spread of disease in the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, rallies and other large gatherings, such as physical education or group music classes or eating in cafeterias; increasing the distance between desks, separating office and holiday times, limiting unnecessary appointments, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When a large amount of disease is spread in a local community, additional school stoppages may be considered as a social distancing strategy. The health risks of law enforcement personnel performing routine activities are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who have to contact people who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If workers come into close contact during the emergency, their duty belts and tools should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wiper before reuse, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and dispose of used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death services workers to be high or very high risk exposure.
High-risk jobs of contact include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who come into contact with patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If workers perform aerosol-producing procedures, or collect or move samples from patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, they are at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-producing methods include tube insertion, cough initiation procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and the collection of samples by inserting tests or instruments.
High-risk, death-related jobs include those who work preparing the bodies of all people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; this becomes very high-risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for people in this high-risk group include quarantine rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, while performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and sleeping environment.
Samples should be handled in accordance with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPE for people who are known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 within 6 feet of their workplace and for people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program, including health testing, training, and medical examinations, requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 or enhanced filtering facial respirators.
Other types of respirators may provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covertol, as COVID-19 is not spread through bodily fluids, but rather is a respiratory disease.
WHO recommends a surgical mask only for screening personnel at entry.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the inadequacy of PPE supply worldwide, WHO recommends the use of physical distancing such as telemedicine, transparent windows, and allowing only those directly involved in care to enter the room where a COVID-19 patient is present, using only PPE needed for specific purposes, continuing to use the respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, allowing monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the wearing of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The global COVID-19 pandemic is an event that highlights global human interconnectedness and our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the global compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen among all our colleagues through email, phone calls and chat is a remarkable testament to the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues.
Last week someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how much it means to the world to be able to see Wikipedia right now and how powerful a symbol it is that this important resource is online and available to everyone.
Your job makes it possible, whether it's keeping the sites running or paying our colleagues or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant changes in the way we work together from this coming week.
The Bible says: "The one who is in the house of Jehovah is his servant".
As Robin mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought in that conversation about the best way to respond to the situation we were facing and how to keep the company alive at this time.
Most of us wanted to relieve the pressure and support our cause for the long term.
If you need to dial back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
Until further notice, our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normally, the mission can put you to use.
But the world is uncertain right now, and whether you need to take care of a loved one or pick up groceries or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
It's hard to say, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian at T&C Ops so that T&C can assist and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from the authorities.)
People working as hourly workers will be paid full wages.
We have already said, and we vow again to honor our commitment to our contractors and our colleagues as watchmakers.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a way to divert their stress from the world around us in a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We'd like you to contact your manager so we can know what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all our departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to collaborate on what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, just let us all focus on the most urgent projects.
If you work slowly now, you won't hurt yourself.
We do not plan to work double time to feed ourselves after the pandemic.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish the job on time, which is no longer realistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and deadlines.
What happens with the APP?
To align with our new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we also want to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which would give more time to budget preparation to allow employees to prioritize essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones, while also complying with the demands of those who want or need to work on reduced schedules for the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and we will update the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
I thank the APP team for their leadership in this.
Office conditions, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But as a precaution, we hired a team of antiviral cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect every surface and lobby and elevator bench that entered our floor.
The building is employing its own service-duty protocol-using products that help keep their tenants safe.
We are relieved that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco last week.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a space in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know this can be a compromise, and wanted to give you some advice:
If the meeting is too long, limit it to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to break them up into smaller parts over several days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep an agenda, and send the text materials ahead of time.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom, make video the default to facilitate live collaboration and connectivity.
To facilitate each meeting, have someone monitor the questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and have someone take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.
The HR Management Team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics instruction to help grow the work allocation across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community donors to cancel public events like the Wikimedia-funded Edytathon until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying these targets.
This coming week we will be inspiring additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
There seems to be both a sense of depression over the general disruption of the global community, but also the ability and clarity of Wikimedia and elsewhere to focus on their own community.
In the coming days CRT is working to create a page on the Meta-Wiki, to provide a place for the community to monitor the impact and follow our interactions with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are all united in this situation and will help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and find other important information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff residing in the significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please feel free to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide assistance and coordination as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a departure from our duties and responsibilities.
It is rather an acknowledgement that we are now likely to have to adapt our tasks and responsibilities in ways that we have not done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movements need, and deliver the services that the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to help each other and make room for the important work that is coming in the weeks and maybe even months to come.
We need your help to do that, and so we want you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can be healthy when the time comes.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hime V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Bangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the cell membranes of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the work of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (≥1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal electrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active site in the activator is uncovered on the cell surface of the lung and other tissues.
The exocrine domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadades and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the membrane of alveolar type II cells of the lungs, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and vascular endothelial cells of most organs, and the cyclic muscle cells of the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into the vasokonstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 isolates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) from angiotensin II and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can differentiate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the membrane exchange of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with heart failure.
ACE2 as a transmembrane protein serves as the entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and displacement of the endosomes located within the cell, both the virus and the enzyme.
This entry process also requires the priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential cure. This has helped some to speculate that lowering the levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continued use of evidence-based ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, there was a significant 34% reduction in pneumonia risk associated with the use of ACE inhibitors""".
"In addition, ""ACE inhibitors also reduced the risk of pneumonia in patients, especially those with high risk of pneumonia, stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although their results were less potent than those for overall pneumonia risk".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered an innovative therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of piglets with symptoms of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
In humans, rhACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours and an onset of action of 30 minutes, with a duration of action (stability) of 24 hours.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be promising in people who are intolerant to class I renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or have conditions where angiotensin II secretion is elevated.
"b'COVID-19 Apps are mobile software applications designed for contact detection, i.e. the process of identifying individuals who have come into contact with an infected person (""contacts"") in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic".
Numerous applications were developed or proposed in several areas and jurisdictions with official government support.
Several infrastructure has been created for the development of contact tracing apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems that work on the basis of geolocation of app users.
Relatively unauthorized access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user touch-and-go to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was created by a local IT group, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched Stop Corona!, a Bluetooth-based app aimed at detecting the manifestation of symptoms of a potentially infected person and providing a quick response from healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store as of 14 April 2020.
"On 12 April, the government announced that the Connection Tracking app was in the advanced stages of development and would be available for use in a few weeks. Similar apps ("StopCovid") are planned in Ireland and France".
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geo-fencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure they stay at home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a lack of effectiveness if the app's acceptance is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of confusing or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set restrictions on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only ""governmental"" or otherwise reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who advocate for privacy expressed their concerns regarding the implications of surveillance of the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus global pandemic will be terminated once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The agency announced eight conditions for the government project:
"Supervision must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate"".
There should be a sunset line to enhance monitoring and surveillance;
Data use for COVID-19 purposes should be restricted;
Protect information security and anonymity and demonstrate security based on evidence;
Digital surveillance was needed to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalization;
The sharing of any data with third parties must be specified by law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"Significant participation of all ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health experts and marginal groups will be required. The German KOS Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Oehne Grengen) (RSF) have issued a checklist".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to remove tracing processes from the operating systems of their devices when they are no longer needed, thus resolving the problem of persistent surveillance.
Some countries used network-based location monitoring instead of apps, which eliminated both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all central server systems require access to personal location data; multiple privacy-preserving systems have been created that use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
An app-less system was used in South Korea for contact monitoring.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to send notifications via text message to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential contacts, the government has made location information available to the public, with some approvals due to far-reaching changes in data privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
Many of these data are available to the public through apps and websites, and some countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected communication detection is a well-established concept with a practical component of research education dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording the proximity of another cellphone user using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized codes of conduct include decentralized privacy-preserving proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive codes of conduct and procedures for mobile communication identification (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable information never leaves the device and occurs within all matched devices.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on a white paper called Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, which was released in March 2020. Another similar effort is SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of their information.
On 5 April 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was established by a few groups that came together on what was essentially the same approach and broader overarching codes of conduct that were needed, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling universal interoperability of identification and alerting apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has the open-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to track people in contact, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also released details of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three stages:
A roll-out of tools to enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to track coronavirus
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android: Google and Apple plan to solve the take-up and endless surveillance issues by first delivering the system through an operating system update and then removing it in the same way if a disaster occurs.
Drug repositioning (also known as multi-purpose, re-profiling, new-functioning, or reverse-treatment) is the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or condition different from the one it was originally designed to treat.
This is a pathway of scientific research currently being pursued for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convoluted plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-specific proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysing these binding sites provides a reasonable project for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the papine-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helix, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussain A.A., et al. studied various candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in his pre-clinical studies for candidate skeletal similarity by the most similar approved drug to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity diagnostic trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in New York state would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as an investigational treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to participate in clinical trials within the European Union.
"The CDC states that ""the use, dose, or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven".
"The doctors said they were using the drug because they had no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be ""clearly effective"".
In the four-day interval, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not receive it had a duration of illness of 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients conducted in Wuhan, half were given Favipiravir and half were given Umifenov.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug was completely inadequate and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicines from Japan for stockpiling and use the military to deliver medicines to university hospitals, where the medicines would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use in pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs, concluded that ""no benefit was observed"".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO includes lopinavir/ritonavir in the international mutual support trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had in-vitro antiviral activity against multiple phyllo-, pneumocyst-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is that it develops immunity through mutation which can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
Several preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to prevention. Several diagnostic trials are underway, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for people with additional serious illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for the delivery of vaccines for hospitalized and critically ill individuals with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a diagnostic trial for alvesco (cyclosonide), a taijin inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat pre-symptomatic patients with novel coronavirus.
A trial of a type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients in critical, hospital admissions to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is taking 6000 adults aged 40 years or older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective method of contraception, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used in the treatment of patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on the use of enoxaperin sodium in preventive and sedative doses in 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, systematic scientific attention has been focused on reconstructing approved antitoxic drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: According to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines, ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Umifenvir: Umifenvir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition.
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially novel for treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tsilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed diagnostic trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that they did not expect an effective vaccine for the virus, SARS-CoV-2, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in the Phase I safety trial.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the released genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was stated that the CEPI initiative is conditional on speed, production capacity, large scale deployment and global access to develop the vaccine.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working towards R&D in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that have advanced in the Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The virus is caused by a vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5)
In April, CEPI scientists reported 115 total vaccinated individuals in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 were confirmed as active (according to the Milken Institute, 79), and 37 were reported as others, but these are based on little publicly disclosed information (presumably planned).
Phase I-II trials conduct initial safety and immunity testing and are typically randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted at multiple sites while determining more specific, effective doses.
Phase III trials with vaccine efficacy and control group for disease prevention typically involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects at optimal drug doses.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still under ""pre-clinical"" studies)".
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular-binding vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
In Canada, around 24 January 2020, the University of Saskatchewan International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-Intervac) announced the start of work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies led by Hanneke Schuitemaker announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing a Seva vaccine in conjunction with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18th March 2020, Emergent Bio Solutions announced a partnership in manufacturing with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the Oncogene Laboratory in Romania published a brief paper on a vaccine design of the same technology used for neonogen vaccination therapy for cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, Generax subsidiary Neugenerax Immuno-Oncology announced that they were launching a vaccine project to develop a LI-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On 5th March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced their plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detroit and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or around 10th March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has merged with Novavax Inc.
In the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12th March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working on 11 isolates and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, albeit at a fast pace.
On 12 March 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like molecule partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR).
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory testing with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered to give 'a large amount of money' to Kurivac to obtain a monopoly on the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical trials, and diagnostic trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they would receive the results of pre-diagnostic trials in April 2020 and may have their final vaccine candidate tested on humans in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research consortium for COVID-19 vaccines, which included Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to US$29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun trials of six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical immunity against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Chicago.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for COVID-19 vaccines, and several new vaccines have plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVacc on mice, stating that ""MNA-determined SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that appeared early in week 2 after vaccination"."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be engineered using bacteriophages to make replications inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a combination of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing company, created a unified resource for the US government, industry, and three universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
An additional 4,170 healthcare workers are being sought for an additional randomized trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary studies evaluating vaccine efficacy in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals indicate the need for biosecurity-level 3 control levels and international coordination for the management of live viruses to ensure standard protection practices.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS broke out, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and immunizations against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed its first clinical trials in humans and three others are ongoing, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other variants of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are mild, in some cases it may progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread to humans through small sputum particles caused by close contact, often by coughing, sneezing or talking.
When saliva particles are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than spreading over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it is likely to spread before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and a low-pitched mouth or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea have been observed with a percentage variability.
Some cases in China were initially only seen with chest cramping and chest palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
It's called the germ-eating stage.
The viral exposure period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms will show it within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests they may play a role in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected individuals who are asymptomatic is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic while hospitalized.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily count; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected people tested asymptomatic that day.
Both saliva and spit can carry a higher number of viruses.
Speaking out loud produces more saliva than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the face can spread tiny droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission may be possible, and air collectors placed in people's outdoor hallways gave positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory discharges to become airborne particles and thus cause airborne diffusion.
The risk is considered low, although there is concern that it may be spread through stool. The virus is most contagious when symptoms are seen in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms are apparent, but the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person typically infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on cardboard for up to one day, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and 99% copper for up to four hours.
It varies with humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective when used properly; soap products break the fatty protective layer of the virus, neutralizing it and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospital admission.
Of the six patients, five of the first samples showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on day two of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in nature related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large quantities in the lung type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 to enter the host cell".
Severe cardiac trauma was reported in 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular episodes is higher due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial trauma may also be associated with the heart's ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 receptors travel quickly to the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammatory infiltrate-associated lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tendency to move to the respiratory tract-containing epithelial cells - ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreted monocytes and recruitment of severe pulmonary pathology.
The autopsy report was lymphocytic infiltrate.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or saliva samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and reveal the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in the pipeline of development, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience in testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA approved the first topical hygiene test for use in the United States later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend infection detection methods based on diagnostic features and epidemiological risk.
A bilateral, multilobar ground-glass opacity with a marginal, unparallel and posterior distribution is common in early transmission.
Subplural dominance, irregular pavement (lobelar septal proliferation by filling of the altered alveolar) and consolidation may be observed with progression of the disease.
Very little information is available on the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Plurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pneumonia - the most common type of lung cancer, but also the most common type of lung cancer.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytosis hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation including lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: Damaged dispersed alveolar (DAD) with dispersed alveolar secretions.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia sarana: organization of the saliva in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and practicing proper respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with bare hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue during coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public to partially limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing instructions also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected before 2021, a key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, this is known as ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers when only soap and water are not available. WHO provides two formulations for local production in places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
The antimicrobial activity in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide alcohol is used to remove bacterial spores; it is ""not an active ingredient for hand antiseptics"".
Glycerol is added as a humicant.
People are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other critical organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a regular mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive therapy may be effective in people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonology specialists in the United States have organized treatment recommendations from various organizations into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for initial use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of viral transmission, especially in healthcare environments when performing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that in addition to using evidence warnings, contact warnings, and airborne warnings, the person be kept in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). The CDC has outlined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust particles but efficacy against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for label-specific use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face coverings or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a few percent are.
Some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or by-level positive airway pressure is being actively studied in patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure for hospitalized people.
It is not known whether either of these will lead to the same benefit for those with serious illnesses.
Some doctors choose to keep it through invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe events are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, limiting the capacity of health management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of cases of severe COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance with ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 in hospitals end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is further complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen delivery, while reducing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax associated with ventilators.
High levels of PEEP may not be available in old ventilators.
Potential treatment studies began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing diagnostic trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While it may take until 2021 for new drugs to be developed, several drugs that are under trial are already approved for other uses or are already in pre-trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious illnesses.
WHO proposed volunteers to participate in a potential efficacy and safety trial. The FDA has provisionally approved convex plasma as an investigational treatment where the person's life is seriously or immediately at risk.
The necessary diagnostic studies to show it is safe and effective for disease have not been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect the potential risk of transmission of 'close contact' and consequently surveillance data.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine if a potential risk is detected, it also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect and enforce quarantine of those who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, Deutsche Telekom shared integrated phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, in March 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus and for research purposes.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said mobile phone operators told him that ""40% of people are moving around anyway""".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may feel ill from quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects or fear of their own infection.
"The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic depression are the perfect catastrophe to damage people's mental health and well-being"."
Like other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, the disease may progress with little or no symptoms.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but severe or terminal cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but data from COVID-19 is lacking. In some humans, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
In the majority of severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can cause rapidly increasing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, particularly prothrombin prolongation, was observed in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was observed in 4% of the group.
Transaminases have been seen in approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between onset of symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was 10 days.
However, patients transferred to ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the interval from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full six to 41-day period.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the pulmonary sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid secretion in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Cardiac arrest or increased troponin levels were identified in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to the US March data, 89% of hospitalizations were pre-existing. The socioeconomic status of a region and the availability of medical facilities can also affect mortality.
The estimation of mortality from this disease varies not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
Counting fewer mild cases may overestimate the mortality rate.
However, the reality is that deaths are the result of past attacks, which means that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Hong Kong hospital authorities noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is highly likely based on behaviour of other coronaviruses, but recovery from COVID-19 has been reported in those cases after positive coronavirus test results.
These cases are feared to be due to a more severe deterioration of the permanent infection than recurrence.
The virus is thought to be of natural and animal origin, through spillover infection.
The exact source is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A survey of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was published in The Lancet in January 2020, with the first date of onset of symptoms reported as 1 December 2019.
The official release from WHO stated that the initial onset of symptoms was on 8th December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and U07.2 to deaths due to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The death-to-case ratio refers to the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death-to-infection ratio as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which identifies the percentage of those diagnosed who have died from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which identifies the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics do not have a fixed time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Casiglione Di'Adda, is a small village of 4,600 people, with 80 (1.7%) already dead.
In Gangelet, the disease spread through carnival festivals and among younger people, causing relatively few deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
Moreover, the German health system has not collapsed.
In the Netherlands, blood donors may have about 3% antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004%) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have found higher mortality rates among men.
Men are at their highest risk in their 50s, and the gap between men and women closes in their 90s.
China's mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Sex-based immunological differences, relatively low smoking prevalence among women and the development of co-morbidities in men at a younger age than women, such as high blood pressure, may play a role in higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
Since April 2020, the US government has not been tracking gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at higher risk of being exposed to the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or human groups, in line with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing contamination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communication".
"Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"".
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness as the temporary name for virus and disease in terms of the 2015 guidelines on the use of virus and disease location.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare components such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in an Italian hospital and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, a local new company tested the manufacturer's product manufacturing and produced the necessary 100 valves overnight.
Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
It is believed that humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is underway by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched a "mutual support trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest promise of efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but several companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, researchers are aiming to develop a full-fledged virus vaccine.
The aim of using the virus, whether it is inactivated or dead, is to generate an immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study targeted the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third technique is nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, innovative technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines must be tested from any of these strategies for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first diagnostic trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a genetic code that does not harm to replicate from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent growth has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active diagnostic trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of the studies in China are being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine Phase III trials of Remdecivir across countries are due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated including Remdecivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon biter.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir in March 2020.
Diagnostic improvement has been observed in patients treated with the experimental drug Remdesivir.
Phase III diagnostic trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, the pillars of research need to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending one dose of the drug per day, notes that doubling the dose can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Initial data suggested that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further vivo studies after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparation of the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) through interaction with the ACE2 receptor is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir in vitro does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine disruption can be a complication of the later stage of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine rapid release properties. Tocilizumab was included in the National Health Commission of China's medical guidelines after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a Phase 2 randomized trial at the national level in Italy after seeing positive results in people with serious illnesses.
Blood tests with serum ferritin to detect cytokine disruption are meant to prevent the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017 CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA based on a past-related case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination to those who need it.
The technique was tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral inactivation is the anticipated mechanism of a particular approach by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of generated monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of liquid portions of blood taken from recovered patients, can be increased to rapidly synthesize these virus-specific antibodies.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
