When we are about to die, we shall be alone. From all our earthly possessions we shall be about to depart. Earthly friends - friends who point out our position, our wealth or our social qualities - will leave us when we enter the dark valley. From those bound to us by the strongest ties - our relatives, our loved ones, our children, brothers, sisters, and others no less dear to us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior - from them too we must depart. Though not all will leave us. There is one who "remains closer than a brother" - One who having loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.

In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmate. In the second situation, White takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
