Welsh AM is annoyed by you as a toy
There was a concern among some AMs that their names should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was started as a result of a plan to change the name of the local council to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across all political spectrum are so anxious that it can lead to insults.
A Labour AM said its members were worried that it was falling behind the Twp and Pwp.
For book fighters outside Wales: In Welsh twp means slice, pwp means poison.
AM Wear said the whole thing was "angry", and there were other comparisons.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open-minded" about the name change, but claimed it was a short transition from MWP to the Games.
In this sense the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the English letter u of Yorkshire.
The National Assembly Commission, which drafted the rules to introduce the name change, stated: The final decision and any interpretation of what is called the Members of the National Assembly shall be the word of the members themselves.
The Welsh Planning Commission 2017 authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultations and the objectives that found widespread support for calling the national assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the name of the AMs, the Commission was based on the Welsh Parliamentary Members or WMP, but the MWP's choice was largely supported by public consultation.
The AMs are certainly proposing more options, but the struggle to reach an agreement could be a major pain for Chief Executive Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver a written order for the changes in the coming weeks.
The rules for the amendments will include further changes to the way the national assembly operates, including rules for the composition of the AMs and the technical aspects of the organization's system.
AMs will have a final vote on the question of what should be called when they refer to the bill.
Macedonians will go to the polls for the nomination of a change of name
Voters will be able to vote on Sunday if their country's name will be changed to Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was held to settle a long-standing dispute between neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its mountainous neighbors' names and claims on its territory have been expressed, and they have continued to block its request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the election and the name change, has said he will ignore the election.
However, supporters of the appointment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that corruption and name changes are the only costs of joining the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's Bell Falls as the Church in Harlem and the National Convention
"In the past, the elders I spoke to said there were bars and churches all around", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is none.
He said that he understood the outcome of the bars.
People are gathering in different ways now, he said.
The bar is no longer a room where people go regularly.
For church members, it is a concern that the profits and sales of property will not last as long as the leaders thought, but they will soon return to where they started.
Church members, he added, could be replaced by a large residential building, which would be used by people of the same species who would not assist the rest of the sanctuary.
The vast majority of people buying apartments in these houses will be white, o said, so they will have to speed up the day of the complete closure of these churches because it will be difficult for most people to immigrate into these houses as members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congresses before Harlem became a black city - the City Hall in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The first Methodist congregation left in 1930.
The six black congregations worshiping nearby took the name of the house.
Black congregations took over St. Martin under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a blockade of merchants on Highway 125, the main shopping street in Harlem, who prevented black people from hiring or supporting the market.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but as Father Johnson's church organized the renovation, they built the bell tower.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
The expert who struck the bell in July called it something else: Traditional treasures and historical equipment cannot replace.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who visited the largest bell tower in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not succeed him.
What has been discussed at St. Martin over the past few months is the story of complex architects and designers, some of whom were introduced by the church's leaders, others by the church's bishops' ministries.
The training room - a church administration unit, full of leaders - wrote to the church department in July for the opinion that the church department would want to transfer the bills to the parish, even if the parish did not engage in hiring the clergy and manufacturers sent to the parish department.
Some church members complained about the lack of revelation in the church department.
The 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark in a lobbying raid in California
The 13-year-old boy fell asleep and was injured by a shark on Saturday as he was forced into the water for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. on the banks of the Beacon River and the Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends were forced into the water about half an hour early Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, then he and some others boarded a boat to help pull him into the water.
Hammel rightly said that he thought it was a new idea to catch lobsters, but then he found out that it was ringing, and I came!
I did it!'
All of his legs were torn out,  Hammel said he noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water! Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed in critical condition.
The species of shark that made the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in an editorial that the shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a bad shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a serious injury to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed the river from the Ponto River Gorge at Casablad to Swami at Ecinitas within 48 hours for research and protection purposes.
Giles also said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered to be bad.
Sainbury's plans to enter the UK jewellery market
Sainbury battles Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by using a well-crafted jewelry store filled with professional assistants.
As part of a £2.8bn drive into the UK jewellery market, which continues to grow into a clothing and home appliances market and returns, the jewellery line will be tested in 11 stores around the city and transferred to other stores in the coming year if successful.
The cost of cosmetics is coming as stores and businesses are pushing to fill the gap previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would scale its cosmetics product range to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and the first Dr. PawPaw.
Real sizes from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have slots in areas with similar brands to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The stores are reopening its jewellery store to make the majority of the products animal-free - a requirement that growers now have.
In addition, Fragrance Shop sellers will be licensed to two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the daily movement to small grocery stores means that the larger stores have more work to do to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's CEO, has said that small shops will continue to be like a supermarket where department stores are trying to reimburse Aldi and Lidl's taxpayers by adding more jobs to non-food items.
Sainsbury has a small Argos store in several markets, and has introduced a significant number of Habitats since it bought the two companies two years ago, which it says has increased the food market and increased the value of the purchase.
Previous attempts at a supermarket to resume the search and sale of drugs have failed.
Sainsbury tried a merger between Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger stalled after a dispute over how to distribute profits from pharmacy stores to its major retailers.
The new rules come after Sainsbury sold a 281-store pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would work on the plan, by adding the size of large, well-known healthcare stores such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's marketing director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics to create an environment for our customers.
We also invested in specialised staff who would be available to advise.
Our brand size is designed to fit all needs, beautiful surroundings and good conditions means that we promote a decorative environment that is distinguished among the old ways of doing business.
Iwe has signed a £11million deal with Peter Jones as Holly Willoughby
Legendary Dragons member Peter Jones is filled with anger as TV presenter Holly Willoughby signs off on an £11million deal between her real estate business to focus on her new deal between Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time for the homewear and furniture market Truly.
Both of their businesses have been put on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop market.
This Morning's announcer, 37, went to Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has spared the wrath of Dragons legend Peter Jones by leaving their successful live-in business in the last few days - to focus on her newly-branded contract between Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reporters said Jones was furious when a much-loved TV girl agreed during a rally on Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to focus on the Truly homewear and furniture market.
Compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business, the deal was predicted to double Willoughby's assets to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to visit one of his vacation homes.
A headline said: Truly Holly's greatest concern.
It should be his future in the medium that will take care of him for decades to come.
His decision to leave left everyone in a state of confusion.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and it came very close at the beginning.
There is a full-service warehouse at Marlow Headquarters that is ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's anchor, who is one of Britain's most famous investors, could cost the store millions of dollars due to a massive investment in products ranging from chairs and candles to towels and home furnishings, and the possibility for a second execution at its opening.
It may be the end of the long chain.
Willoughby's mother of three, Dan Baldwin, was a friend of Jones and Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016, Jones, 52, joined as a lead in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV advertising company.
Willoughby will be the company representative of M&S, and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's Im A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said last night We can no longer talk about his business.
Hard words then we love each other
He was known for his hate speech and for his disdain for the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump forgive so much?
Trump spoke in a journalist's voice to his son.
I have left nothing behind.
He also said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June that Trump hailed as a major step in North Korea's massive nuclear disarmament.
But the talks on eliminating nuclear weapons have ended.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean high-level envoy Ri Yong told world leaders that the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a consistent response from the U.S. for the North's previous operations and disarmament.
Instead, he added, the U.S. continues to impose penalties for using firearms.
Trump followed the idea of good faith in his summary speech.
We are doing a lot in North Korea, he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could die.
Now we have a big real crop
He said his efforts to improve the clearance between Kim has produced positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free the use of the weapons and restoring the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his different approach to collecting along with Kim.
It's very easy to play the president, but instead of playing 10,000 people in a crowd trying to get into a crowded area, we have about 200 people standing here, Trump said, measuring the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroyed the Islands, Killing Many
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international conventions were told that they were not governmental.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been expelled from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, the first reason for seeking foreign assistance.
Mostly, sadly, they made it clear that they did not want foreign help, so it was a challenge, Mrs. Sumbung said.
Since Save the Children is registering a trip to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work in the country.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were investigating the situation in Palu to see if foreign companies would be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
In the face of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the city is not immune to global unrest.
As the tsunami tower in Aceh, this is not common on other watersheds.
The signs of a tsunami and no warning in Palu, even if forecast, could contribute to the death of people.
At best, traveling between most of Indonesia's islands was a struggle.
National disasters add to the complexity of organizational structures.
A hospital ship was set up in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims and is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's infrastructure upgrade of Indonesia has ruined the theme of his election campaign, but he has lost money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's budget and execution were short as he awaited re-election next year.
Mr. Joko and the conservative opposition have long existed in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced the conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim criminals in street fighting, using knives, bows and spears, and other vicious weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's response in the final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat by Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team was chasing 1-0.
He put the ball in his left hand before shooting the ball over the post.
The test went over the box as it moved to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually crossed the Cape Arrizabalaga and stretched out and fell into the net.
It was trying to get into that position, holding the ball and players like Shaq and his colours in front of him every time there was more energy, so I myself tried to figure out how much more energy I had, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, touched her once, didn't think much about it, shot her right away.
Chelsea led 1-0 on penalties after a 25-minute goal from legendary Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a back pass in the game, before he ran away from the halfway point and hit the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a fast run in the middle of the stadium.
He played a good ball, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard crossed the line and scored the goal in the top of the net by shooting a left-footed shot and passing Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool and Napoli will play in the first leg of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the city's disaster center said early Sunday morning.
Most people were reportedly trapped under the collapsed buildings of a 7.5 earthquake that on Friday triggered a 20-foot high wind, the company spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is filled with weeds from fallen houses.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police in an investigation into a murder to stab a woman with a knife
An inquest into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhard, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound in Grayson Mews on John Street, arresting a 32-year-old man in the murder investigation.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come to their homes.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: The investigation is still in its early stages but I would ask anyone in the John Street ward in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can handle anything in the dashkam image to contact us because they may have information relevant to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who found the body was a local resident in Birkenhead, found her in a bank.
This afternoon friends believed them when the woman came to the camp to ask about where she had been this morning.
An investigation is underway as police say they are preparing to report the incident to the deputy.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mew tried to enter the building but police told him that no one was entering or leaving the house.
When he learned what had happened, he was shocked.
The residents are now told that it will take a long time before they are allowed to enter again.
A police officer was reportedly telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the camp in tears.
He was making a bad repetition.
At 2 p.m. the car was outside, and two police officers inside the line were outside.
Some police officers stood inside the rope and watched the houses.
Anyone with information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and report 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament is the latest monument to the debate over the rewrite of history.
His expulsion would be a punishment for his Taliban-like crimes against many of England's cultural and religious institutions, committed by the persecuted Puritans.
But The Cromwell Report described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and "a rewrite of an old story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Group, said: It is unlikely that the current debate over the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statue and statue outside the Palace of Westminster will be the focus.
The religious stampede during the English Civil War was not Cromwell's order or his own.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been unjustly executed for the wrongs committed by his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful performance for Cromwell illuminated 19th-century thought and was part of a human history that many believed should be exalted.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is often promoted, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliamentary pressure from outside, in his official remarks.
But that is a perfectly accurate illustration and is the subject of an ancient and ongoing debate.
Clearly, the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the development of our community, and Cromwell was so prominent that he represented a part of the divide.
His maturity as the Supreme Protector is worthy of exaltation and to be remembered.
A Chinese Farmer Bewitched by a Beetle and Murder
A farmer was stabbed and killed in a market in western and southern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname Yaun, was found dead, paralyzed, and bloodied near the pork market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer and fisherman approved vaccination of the chickens in the chicken household on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He and his nephew reportedly set off from the Yunnan province near Wenesde to sell 15 hens at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead, and he found a doorway to an open house.
He said that inside the pig's house was a large amount of real blood in his mouth.
Forensic research has suggested that the 550 pounds of fat had affected the farmer, according to the report.
My nephew's legs are covered in blood and wounds, the nephew said, using his father's name and a reference to Wu, as reported by Guiyan Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the goats.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yaun's or his nephew's.
A sales manager told the Evening News that the dog was locked up to prevent it from drowning, while the police were collecting hand tools in the camp.
Yuan's family and the licensors are discussing a financial crisis over his death.
Although it is rare, a real hug is a historical record.
In 2016, a dog slept with a woman on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was haunted by 650 pigs and their daughters until his wife drove the animal away.
After the Oregon farmer's chicken was eaten in 2012, a Mantioba farmer told CNC News that true and violent but blood sugar can be a motivator.
They are just afraid.
They are small, they have great research ... they can't hurt you.
You should give him the proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy precipitation from the southern and eastern portions of the US
As a weather forecast, Typhoon Rosa falls over the cold waters of northern Mexico.
Rosa will, after all, bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and the western and southern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricanes, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, it is located 385 miles west-south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Now, a large crater has begun to collect across the Pacific Ocean and eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California watershed on Monday as a tidal wave, it will begin to dig deep into the deep northwest and south of the U.S.
Rosa will raise about 10 inches of rain off the Mexican side on Monday.
Then the floodwaters and the melting in the great open space will produce a large wave of rain that spreads westward and southward over the coming days.
In the region, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will lead to severe flooding, sweat and wetlands can be in the desert.
Deep water will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour and a half, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
As expected 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in some parts of the West and south, especially across Arizona.
Floods can occur in a state and quickly because of the nature of the heavy rainfall spreading the mud.
It would be a bad idea to walk into a desert where there is a risk of torrential rains.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms and forecasts can cause storms and sand and wind.
The next big rift will bring some heavy rains along the coast of Southern California.
A rainfall of over half an inch can occur, which can lead to slight sweating and road and military damage.
This would be the region's first rainy season.
Some heavy rain sprayers will begin arriving in Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday nights.
Heavy rainfall would spread through the Fourth Quarter on Tuesday and continue through to Friday.
October could see some extreme temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will be warmer.
Sometimes this leads to a big change in the search results in a short time.
There are many examples of dramatic temperature differences that have passed between the U.S. and Saturday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moined, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will continue to try to cool and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm early October of the 80s from the Southern to the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a great opportunity for the average temperatures above for the eastern U.S. to exceed the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's funeral
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of the 1980 rape of Christine Blasey Ford, on the main television network.
Now, with the political power gridlining continuing, the media was suspending the scheduled events for Friday's final quarter: a deal that Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake had planned for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Legislative Assembly that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had drunkenly beaten him and tried to rob him of his high school performance.
Kavanaugh, in a highly influential statement, said he was 100 percent sure he hadn't.
There is a chance that more than 20.4 million people watched it according to Nielsen on Friday.
The station averages viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks to show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen often has problems with the equality of the people in their industry.
To make that clear, that's the size of the viewers who are in the category of winning football club or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose rational editors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, surpassed the entire network by averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day census, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest grew as the crowd ended.
Flake was the one who paid attention to Friday's talk.
As Republican media outlets and the media outlet released its announcement that he would be extraditing Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning where tourists were angry and hated him for trying to climb the escalator and attend the Grand Jury.
He humbly waited for several minutes for the swearing-in, which was immediately shown on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you", said one woman.
Do you feel that he is honest with our people?
She was told, "You have authority when most women do not".
Flake said that his company had issued a statement and said, before the conference was over, that he would have more to say at the end of the convention.
Cable networks and the media were covering up what happened immediately after, when the General Assembly had to raise its hand to push Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Legislature for election.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would monitor the nomination within the next week, which was being supported by the minority Democrats.
Flake's mind was slightly altered by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
After Coons's consultation, and after several lawsuits, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was justified, as it was a mistake that Republicans did not have a vote to support Kavanaugh in the referendum.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British PM May and critics accused of politics over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of using Britain's future political  for her plans to leave the European Union and undermine public interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson confirmed his dispute over his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea that Britain and the EU should both collect taxes was a "big silly thing".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murder of LSU terrorist
Police arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities uploaded a video of the Sims-Simpson fight, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB said.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said he agreed to the murder of Wayde.
His bomb was stolen at $350,000, Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Inspectorate released the first findings on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is praising the hard-working Louisiana State Police, state police laboratories, Southern University police and local residents for their support in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for his diligence and follow-up.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was in a state of shock and disarray due to Wayde's death.
This is what you've always thought, Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern tip of mainland Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to get out of the volcano after damage was detected in the crater, and it recorded 183 shipments of gas and dust over 24 hours.
The station detects a number of sounds and earthquakes.
Images in public toilets show small ashtrays and a car park in the center of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geologists have detected the origin and damage of the volcano 45 miles (72 km) east-south of the mainland since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been known as Don Goyo since 1994.
Police and separatists in Catalonia fought before the anniversary of the independence elections
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters attacked police, while thousands paid thousands to join another march to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia referendum and the bell.
A facial mask of police and barricades was used to support the split and to paint them gray, creating a black cloud of road ash that often overwhelmed passengers.
Later that day, a riot broke out and the police used a stick to stop the fight.
For hours the movement for freedom was fighting Never forgotten, never forgotten In front of the unity protesters, Life in Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The regional pressure for independence rose within a year after the October 1 Madrid elections saw the electoral process as unconstitutional but that of the Catalonian separatists had already died.
Voters voted in whole to remain free, although few candidates where non-separatists disapproved of the election.
From Catalonia's authorities as many as 1000 people were injured last year as black police tried to stop the election to continue the electoral process across the region of the major clashes.
Freedom activists marched on Friday to block protests and the support of the national police.
The protest continued but they were respected by another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, who was a campaigner in the separatist movement led by his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
Last year we saw one of the best times of our lives.
I watched my parents cry out for a chance to vote but now we're done", she said.
Not to mention a brief victory in the regional elections held last December, pro-Catalonia parties have tried to keep up this year's appeal as many of their most prominent leaders fled or were imprisoned awaiting trial for their role in organising the election and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car builder who recorded the protest on her phone with the support of the police, said that the political parties on both sides had sparked the riot.
He spoke of the people's hearts and efforts very much,.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's most senior officials in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament.
"Putting a candidate for the European elections is the best way to overturn the backlash against democracy and the persecution we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car hit a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for frequent bus-busting in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
The car may have been at fault at one point.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Livingston's first goal by Dolly Menga led to a win
Livingston moved to the Rangers to put Steven Gerrard in his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal set the record as Gary Holt's team advanced to the same level as Hibernia in Second Place.
Gerrard's undefeated Premiership team this year will face the Hearts, who are eight points behind, the following Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extended their win and no return in the division to six games, while manager Holt has not lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost their opportunity to foreigners and inexperienced
Holt's team had to be ahead before scoring, and their strong game caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed but lost his attempt ahead of the goal, then Alan Lithgow lost his attempt as he tried to get the head ball that Craig Halkett had passed in front of the goal.
The four were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, hoping to cause trouble for the foreigners with the balls thrown at the same place.
But that was the way they gave the important goal.
Rangers gave a free kick, Livingston opened the hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to form Menga, who touched him once and went from the middle of the box and scored.
At the time, the Rangers had all the balls but were unable to pass the four defenses and the post guard Liam Kelly was unharmed,
The series continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos assigned Kelly to do his job.
The foot of Rangers postman Allan McGregor was turned by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow missed the ball that Livingston had thrown in one direction.
Balls came repeatedly into Livingston's box, which lost all of them, as two penalties were withheld - after Halkett had introduced Glenn Middleton, one for touching the ball - after Halkett had been withheld.
Fantastic by Livingston - collection
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland and Tony Macaroni Park
The action and the results were terrible for Livingston.
In the eyes of one man, they did well, going ahead and exceeding expectations in their climb.
The sport and team have not changed much since they returned to the top, but credit will go to Holt for the way he has handled the situation since he arrived.
He had many widows.
Captain Halkett played a very hard and defensive role, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in charge throughout the game.
The Rangers had no motive.
Even the best game they had seen under Gerrard, they did not reach the flags.
Their final ball was not enough - only once they opened the home team, it was a development for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a wide-ranging reception in Cologne
There was a smile and a green sky (September 29) as Turkish and German officials saw for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the visit and the start of President Erdogan's conflict with Germany - intended to reconcile relations between NATO allies.
They have been controversial over issues including civil rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police stopped 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of dissidents - mostly Kurds - also raised their voices, hating Erdogan's policies and the decision by the Germans to admit him to the country.
The protests show the division of some Turkish immigrants from Germany and others see him as a dictator.
Deptford traffic accident: Motorcyclist killed in a car accident
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, east-south of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The man stopped in front of the car, and the guards looked at him, but the man died there.
The accident happened months after another cyclist died in a kidney accident while running off the Childers Road, about a mile from the Saturday emergency area.
Metropolitan Police said police were working to identify the man and alert the next person.
The road closure and the large-scale transportation of cars are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six workers injured in riots
Six prison staff have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Service said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday which are still ongoing.
Specialists from Tornado have been called in to solve the riot, which included eight prisoners, and has been staged in one direction.
The workers were examined for minor facial injuries there.
Prison Service Speaker said: Do not send special prison staff to meet the current situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Do not check for injuries in six groups.
We do not accept riots in our prisons, and those who do so will be handed over to black police, who may spend longer in jail.
HMP Long Lartin employs more than 500 inmates, including some of the city's worst criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in hospital after being bedridden by a prisoner.
In October last year, a riot was called to solve a major problem that involved heavy balls and forced workers to sleep.
Hurricane Rosa May Cause Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vega, Salt Lake City (Summer Area Benefit)
It is difficult to see a gun-force storm hitting Arizona, but that is what could happen earlier this week as the remaining force in the Rosa Cyclone passes through the Western and Southern Desert, causing flood hazards.
National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, eastern and southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix immediately on Tuesday, with rainy weather and by Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has tweeted that only ten bad winds have sustained a tropical storm or hurricane within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ coast.
The latest National Hurricane Standards now predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with a total of isolated peaks reaching 6 inches in Mogolllon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western and Southern Deserts including the central Rockies and the Great Basin can reach 1 to 2 inches, with separate collections up to 4 inches and stronger.
For those who are not in the flood zone, Rosa's rainy season can be a blessing to the area with a severe drought.
Although flooding is a major threat, some of this precipitation will be needed as the western and southern parts are now experiencing severe droughts.
According to the U.S. Summer Survey, only over 40 percent experience extreme droughts, the second-highest, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa falls across the Baja California watershed of Mexico.
Rosa, still in the midst of a strong storm Monday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The winds are moving into the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and are therefore slowly dissipating.
So it is expected that heavy rains will hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
A cold weather across parts of Mexico can be severe, and flooding is a threat.
Expect a 3 to 6 inch precipitation from Baja California to the western and northern parts of Sonora, up to 10 inches and stronger, weather.com reported.
Rosa would then travel north from Mexico to the tropics before reaching southern Arizona early Tuesday morning as a thunderstorm, which would pass directly through Arizona and then into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The most anticipated survival from Rosa or its remnants is a massive avalanche in Baja California, western and northern Sonora, and the U.S. Western and Southern Desert, National Hurricane Center said.
These drought-induced precipitation can kill people and sweat in the desert, and in the desert lands.
Midsomer Norton Accusation: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in an attempted murder investigation after a 16-year-old man was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The young man was found with a wound in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he was in good condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock district last night, Avon Somerset Police said.
Police have asked anyone to have a cell phone picture of the cause.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered, heartbroken, angry by the Democratic Party
One vote for Justice Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the cruelty and overreach of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered a heart attack, angered by the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Assembly on Thursday, furiously and vehemently denying the accusation that Christine Blasey Ford had assaulted her ten years earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified against the prosecution.
The president said on Saturday that Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence, character and encouragement that day.
A vote to approve Justice Kavanaugh was a vote to approve the most mature legal opinion of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service and a public record, he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president in a different vein referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the need for Republican emergence in the midterm elections.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going out, but I'm really going out, he said.
So I've been everywhere supporting very good applicants.
Trump reached out to Democrats on a journey to stop and stop.
The first important election in the National Assembly for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
The earthquake, tsunami, and tsunami that killed hundreds in Indonesia, numbers still rise
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful windswept along the coast and wiped out many people, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when a wind of up to 18 feet [6.8 m] hit the ground late in the evening, causing most to die and damage to everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat began to hit, people were holding their celebrations along the river, they did not immediately run away, so it affected them, Sutopo Purwo Nugrogo, a spokesperson for Indonesia's national disaster management agency BNPS said at a rally in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come to his control, he drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground, Nugroho said, and it was reported that the tsunami passed through a large river at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach.
Some climbed trees to survive the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transported to 24 Witnesses in Palu.
The rooftop of the disaster center showed most of the buildings and shops destroyed, bridges rising and falling and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, an earthquake continued along the coast.
There was a systemic impact of earthquakes in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Institute for Research and Technology (BPPT) said that the claim that the magnitude of the Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's land, which extends to the end of a long, narrow river basin, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "spread-related" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the people he affected under the grass of collapsed houses, he said, left 540 people injured and 29 in the blank.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could extend to the 300km (190 miles) coastline along the northern slopes of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications had no information but soap from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
He said this has been an accident, but it could get worse,.
The company was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in Palu, although officials said a strong wind had come during the warning.
In a photo shared in a public toilet, a man can be heard on the roof screaming loudly and warning of an approaching tsunami warning to people on the road below.
Within minutes, a huge flood washed over the river, taking away the house and the car.
Reuters has not been able to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive electrical damage that cut off communication in the Palu region and left the licensors in distress and organized rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees still need food and other supplies for quick living.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only, and will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the refugee shelter in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian Tsunamis has exceeded 800.
He was very wrong.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, while its staff were shaded under a tapestry shade raised outside their factory, they went through a cycle of destruction on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said they told me that they saw many damaged buildings,.
It was very bad.
Even as relief groups began the groundbreaking work of disaster relief, some complained that international relief workers with the necessary skills were being prevented from visiting Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign money, equipment, and personnel can only begin to visit if the site of the destruction is designated a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
It is still a camp-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government said, Okay, this is a national disaster, we can open for foreign aid but there has been no announcement.
As the second night falls in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of those still missing who hold faith and their loved ones will be miraculous and stir the spirits of the worst part of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a baby was thrown out of a pit.
On Sunday, first responders rescued a woman who had been hanging under the grass for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the leader of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two paragliders for the Asian Games in zero, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others arrested under the Roa Roa Penitentiary, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
As a paraplegic, I had my own mental health problems, he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled one time, within an hour of the news of the fall of the Royal Wealth Building spreading through the paragliding pool, he quickly sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach side event.
His message, however, came only from a single grey mark, not a faint blue mark.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent", he said.
$26,750 was taken by the cold during the repair of the ATM in Newport, Levee
The cold on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee at the repair ATM in Newport and Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was clearing the ATM at the resort and was preparing to spend more money, Police Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While at work, another man from behind surrounded the Brink's employee and stole a purse of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many of these people suspected of escaping the scene, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the crime.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapa changed his name to Ye
Rapa Kanye West and changed her name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: People used to be like Kanye West.
West, 41, has recently changed her nickname to Ye and used the same name as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The changes come ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new song Yandhi.
She replaces the actress Ariana Grande in the show who was cancelled for emotional reasons, the show's producer said.
And as a shortened form of his current surname, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
I believe ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, in the Bible it means you, West said earlier this year, when discussing his song title among the Big Boy radio host.
I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, I sing to you, and I sing to you, I sing to you, and I sing to you, and I sing to you, and I sing to you, and I will sing to you, and I will sing to you, and I will sing to you, and I will sing to you, and I will be to you, and I will be to you, and you, and you, and you, and you will be your name you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you will be my name, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, you, and you, we will be, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, we will be, and you, will be, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, will be, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, will be, and you, and you, and you, and you, will be, and you,
It comes from Kanye, which means "one, one, one" - the expression of our goodness, our badness, our complexity, everything.
Fear is also a manifestation of who we are.
One of the famous rappers changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year expressed interest in the names Love and Brother Love.
The former Western partner, JAY-Z, has used but sometimes misused a conventional and large font.
AMLO of Mexico has vowed not to use military force for civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military and soap for civilians to enter the country by the 50th anniversary of student violence.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Mall that he would not use the military to torture Mexican citizens.
Armed gunfire in a cold march at the mall on October 2, 1968, killed up to 300 people during left-wing student protests that began throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly student aid and opening more public universities free of charge.
She has said that there is no job and no education opportunities and that young people are being put into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double the A.I. fee
As China increases sales of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should cut spending on research at the camp, said AI promoter and trainer Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The announcement came as many parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the entire U.S. lacked a well-known AI plan.
On the other hand, China launched its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in new AI deployments by 2030.
Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, I'm sure that all other countries have already contributed to the U.S., but we look forward to the next big surprise in AI, Lee said.
Double funding could increase the opportunity and maturity of the next big AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in China's most well-known AI company, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the highest-ranking Othello musician in America, eventually becoming president of Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee agreed to U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next new players.
Researchers in the U.S. sometimes work hard to get government attention, Lee said.
It's not China that takes over the education authorities; it's the industry, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university experts to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. support its AI efforts.
I think those with PhDs in AI should be automatically granted green cards, he said.
The State Assembly of China adopted the Next Racial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides education to people in the construction industry with one-half of the funding the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education services in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense created the Artificial Intelligence Community, which should connect partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced $2 billion investment in a new project called AI Next.
For NSF, it now spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
On the other hand, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of the National Defense Intelligence Agency has not been in effect for months.
Macedonians contesting the name change
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a solution to the long-standing dispute between Greece that has blocked its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insisting on its mountain neighbourhood name and expressing claims to its territory, has blocked its admission to NATO as well as the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a new name comparison, but the rivals were the capital city and argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's largest Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not contest the election, and the media has also questioned whether the candidates will reach the required 50 percent for the election to be valid.
The question in the nomination document read: You support NATO membership in the EU by accepting a treaty between Greece.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a debt to be paid to follow the adoption of EU and NATO-like laws for Macedonia, one of the emerging states in the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came today to speak out for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia to live as they want under the protection of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, members of the full parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the election to make it more important.
The name change would require two-thirds of the size of the legislature.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of crime at 1 p.m.
However, the result was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters submitted their ballots.
"I decided to raise my vote for my children, our situation in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a Skopje mayoral electorate.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko submitted their ballot for the nomination in Macedonia for a change of the name of the country which would pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov 54, was preparing for a small platform, leading a seat in front of the hall of the electorate that had been set up by those who wanted to block the election.
We stand with NATO and the EU, but we want to enter through the mountains, not through the official channels Kavadarkov said.
We are a city with no money, but we have mountains.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look for others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia mix.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to the required investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a lot of people would like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO", Zaev said after finishing his book.
He said the result would be the certainty of our future.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Constitutional Review Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the election - and not enough votes.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents had scheduled Sunday voting.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
For the election to be successful the results should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the appointment would signal the first major challenge to the government's policy and support of the West since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero outscored all Brighton defenders for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lost to Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker scored a goal in the middle of the field early in the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses, before entering the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by people in green shirts.
He moved one defender before running away from many others to the head of the Brighton box.
Then he hit the ball with his left hand, finding Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who had hit it with his leg to pass the Brighton kicker Mathew Ryan by a single shot to the right side of the net.
Aguero has some foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We discussed the course for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League win.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored a goal in the Brighton stadium in the match.
He sent a beautiful left-handed ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched him a few times before taking Sterling to the post office.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net before he could get out of the stolen field.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the first round of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m., on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to meet spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals and the champion tournament gone, there is no longer any way to get a fresh start.
But Scherzer's big rival hopes to climb the ladder on Sunday at the games with the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a winner's game scenario for the Rockies, who have a game-winning lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rochies earned at least a selection card by winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
Even if we don't have a goal, at least we can play knowing that the circle here in Denver is in the middle of the crowd and the other teams will be playing the highest level of football any time I meet this year.
Why would I not want to be a part of that?
The Nationals are still waiting to announce the starter for Sunday, but have reportedly been relying on Scherzer to step in.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, along with the practice session on Thursday, will play on Sunday as his break.
Washington's offense was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a public meeting in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation involving the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court where he spoke of the need for Republican votes in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done could be ruined in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I don't show up but I show up so I'm everywhere fighting for the very good ones, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this very bad rebel group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
They focused on restoring energy by any means possible, you see, their heartbeat, the bad practice.
They don't care who they've wronged, who they'll rise to gain power and control, that's what they need power and control, we won't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were on a journey to shut down and shut down.
"But you see over the past four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry, angry, mean and dishonest".
He named the top Democrat Dianne Feinstein of the Legislative Assembly, which received a huge outcry from the crowd.
Do you remember the answer?
Have you opened the book?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I thought one - there was the worst show - the worst show I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer talking about expansion.
He does not accept those who express their opinions
When Momentum supporters in my local politics put their hands on me to silence me, it was not a joke.
Look, the latest line of MPs told Labour that they were not accepted - just to express our opinion.
May my congresswoman Joan Ryan get the same reaction because she firmly opposes Semitism.
In my own case, the ban was a criticism of me for rejecting Jeremy Corbyn.
The need for a proper economic policy, national security, and Europe, in turn, were the same issues Jeremy used and disagreed with in previous administrations.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that we want the meetings to be complete and productive.
For almost eight years I was the local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were usually like that.
Sadly today, not the voice of the majority of the assembly and the good politics, the calmness promised are things that have long been forgotten if, indeed, it has only begun.
It is a big mistake that Labour politics does not accept differences, and any opinion is now being considered.
This started as soon as Jeremy became the boss, my colleagues, who I thought shared the same political views with, started to expect me to immediately turn around and take positions I would not agree with either - whether in national security or in an EU market.
Whenever I made a public speech - it would not apply to my words - there was a huge uproar immediately following the rally calling for removal, criticism of the centre-right, and my refusal to be a Labour politician.
But I am not alone.
In fact, I knew that I was still better off than some of my colleagues because of the comments that my messengers often made about politics.
I have a sense of efficiency and determination from my colleagues who get criticism of human nature or race every day but they don't run away.
One of the most depressing aspects of this political era was the commonplace use of harsh criticism.
Jeremy Corbyn and his petition last week that Labour should learn the moral of patience.
The fact is that we are no longer the debate about expansion, nor any 'unreliable' norms or changes in electoral law, politics and the shell.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years and told me to be humble, to stop talking too much then I will not have a problem.
But that is not what I am about in politics.
Since I joined Labour for 32 years as a student, spurred by Thatcher's government tourism, who left my school in a terrible state of disrepair, I wanted to lead a beautiful public service for those most in need - whether I was a local minority leader or a government minister.
I had not previously hidden my political affiliation, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would be confused about my legal status and the areas where I disagree with the current politics.
For those who voted for the bill on Friday, all I can say is that when a country and Brexit will have a negative impact on many of our families, businesses and public services, I did not feel the need to waste time and energy on my support for Labour politicians.
But the truth is one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my designers, or Labour or not: I am happy to serve you and I promise that there is no risk of any reduction or political acceleration that will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr has not seen failure
Two untimely tests have narrowly affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr should win today's Tennents Premiership.
Now at the top of the table, only one team has won ten races.
In the end, it was their defense that was stronger, and he took their better chances, the bullies in the house, and the leader Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have tried our best so far, we have not won, so we are happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: Thanks to Ayr, they took their time more than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute test, which Frazier Climo completed, with Ayr ahead, was awarded a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, which the Warriors left for the game, giving Melrose a chance to score their assist, while Jason Baggot won the unfinished test.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by penalty kicks, before, once in the half, he scored and completed the test alone to make it Ayr's 17-5 in minutes.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second round and Patrick Anderson's test, which Bagoot completed with a head, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was a major delay in the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was thrown, and in the opening, Ayr walked through Stafford McDowall's trial, which Climo completed on goal.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, Melrose benefited another man from the unfinished trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of the great fire season.
The team returned home, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a goalless Climo, outside the penalty line, MacPherson was left behind by Ayr's problems and faced.
Climo turned it on, as he did a little later at the start, so Kyle Rowe grabbed the bullet in David Armstrong's box and sent one of Gregor Henry's teammates for the fifth test of the team at home.
The famous Still Game man needed a new job in the restaurant industry
Still Game's legendary Ford Kieran wanted to join the management after finding out he had been invited to become a director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old played Jack Darvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final in the series, meaning Kiernan is set for life when Craiglang comes to an end.
By accurate records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The group refused to comment on the report, however the Scottish Sun reporter compared Kiernan to seeking to join the prosperous Glasgow restaurant business.
The river is ours: Bolivia is a circular land in the hope of a court reopening the road to the Pacific
The ships and the ships were crowded around the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings and flag waves are a huge river and a blue sky.
The waterfront from Titicaca to the Amazon is full of corners: The river is our nature.
Restoring it is a task.
Across the Bolivian peninsula, the memory of the devastating 19th-century Chilean watershed still shines bright - as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Those expectations are perhaps highest in a decade, as Bolivia awaits a foreign-owned company decision on October 1 after five years of debate.
Bolivia now looks forward to the outcome with encouragement, spirit of unity and calmness, and with a positive attitude, said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Most Bolivians will watch the ICJ's ruling in broad public appearances across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will investigate the interest of Bolivia's accusations that - after decades of favorable talk - Chile is forced to negotiate and give Bolivia a free passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, the attractive Bolivian president - who faces a tough fight for re-election next year - also has much to rely on Monday's decision.
We are nearing return to the Pacific Ocean, he swore last August.
But some investigators believe that the court may not be able to make a decision that would appeal to Bolivia - and that little would change if they did.
The Dutch constitution granted Chile territory, explaining that it would not decide the outcome of possible cases.
In the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the final bells ringing that the case is unambiguous, said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in foreign law.
Far from supporting Bolivian aspirations, the past four years have had the power to reverse.
The issue of access to the river has been taken over by Bolivia's current authorities, Zárate said.
Morales's hatred of the word sweetness and anger have drawn the affection of every remaining Chilean, he compared.
Bolivia and Chile will also start a conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to have a conversation like this afterwards.
The two cities have not had a representative since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, refused to consult and rarely made the court's decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new era of reconciliation between Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with a shared vision, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - used the term water as a political endorsement.
Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Great Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision was an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.
North Koreans have said that nuclear weapons will not be deployed unless they trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not be the first to declare nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promise to the Singapore congregation among the leaders.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be nearing the start of a closed nuclear talks since three months after Singapore's split between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a dream that continued sanctions and U.S. sanctions and the declaration of an end to the Korean War would lead North to his knees.
Washington is very cautious in accepting the Pyongyang declaration where there is no clear action on the part of the disruption.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a growing doubt that Pyongyang's willingness to reject the country's weapons may seem the only way to defend itself.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show showing the latest line and a large headwear that is coming Highway ahead of you
If you want to lift your hat or to completely protect yourself from the sun, look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a dismal headgear for their SS19 street art collection at the Paris Nature Week.
Instagram has been a hot topic this summer, but these designers have not yet released their amazing product in a straightforward fashion.
Valentino's unique hat is a beige hat that is wrapped underneath the cap like wings that cover the heads of the models.
Other heavy appliances include jewelry-plated eyelashes, a warm-up hat and a scarf - but they do not warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed a mask and a sense of horror - he arrived just in time for Halloween.
Most of the beautiful face masks had a flattened lip and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One product looked like a plunger with snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a glass of melted ice cream.
But if you continue to make that high declaration - you are blessed.
Fashion experts predict that the large covers may reach the highways around you.
The white hats come straight from the La Bomba crossing, a two-step-wide green hat that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The trademark confirmed the hat and was not suitable for use when the public broadcaster sent another large-scale demonstration on the street - painting the beach side of the river with thick grass until a model wore a swimsuit.
A hot orange raffia bag, made with thin raffia and applied to a clean skin, is a stand-alone item from the collection SS19 of Jacquemus La Riviera at the Paris Nature Week.
Famous costume designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing a large hat and beach bag reach the highway for the summer to come - as the designer has had such a huge impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for huge supplies.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the world's citizens
The Scottish Independent Schools set a record for the highest level of education, but this continued in 2018 with excellent test results, which were backed by individual wins and other clubs' athletic, artistic, musical and club efforts.
With a growing number of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to bringing the highest levels of employment to their students and parents.
Independent schools are committed to preparing students for future and higher education, their chosen profession and their status as global citizens.
As the education sector can integrate and incorporate the curriculum of higher education, we see new languages evolving to include the topics of choice required within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that's a good thing.
If you speak to him in his own language, that goes to the heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English when we try to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
Starting with the results of this recent year's tests, we can see that languages are being ranked in the competition table with the highest level of maturity among independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received A-Levels.
Data, collected from 74 participating SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved A Grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German readers, 69 percent of French readers and 63 percent of Spanish readers achieved A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as an important skill for children and young people to use in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, seen in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the liberal arts curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Institute for Performance and Skills in 2014 found that employer-sponsored factors prevented them from filling job openings, with 17 percent associated with language skills shortages.
So often, language skills are also essential for young people to prepare for their future career.
With so many job opportunities that may require language, these skills are essential in the business world.
Whatever the skill of choice, if they learn a second language, they will benefit greatly in the future from such long-term skills.
Having the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a person in a multilingual position in front of his or her target audience.
With YouGov's selection of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent are no longer able to speak enough foreign languages to communicate, while French is the only language with a low percentage of letters, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now essential for children today.
Multilingualism, more so than the rich and upper class, will sustain children by providing them with better opportunities and rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language and curriculum.
Some schools will focus more on new languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as most important to the UK in the foreseeable future in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there must be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there must be teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools dedicated to creating an educational environment would support children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future might bring.
There is no denying that today, in the global business environment, languages are advanced and vital for the future of society, so this must be demonstrated in education.
Of course, a new language should be considered as a foreign communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for Scottish youths.
It must be well done.
John Edward was the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools' Conference
Lebron will make his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The darkness has come to an end for fans waiting to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers manager Luke Walton has announced that James will be taking part in the championship-year-long game on Sunday between the Denver Nuggets and San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes he will play is still unknown.
It will usually be more than one but not more than 48, which Walton said on the Lakers website is correct.
Lakers complainant Mike Trudell wrote that James could play a minor league game.
Following sponsorship earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game Lakers championship sponsorship series.
"I don't want the early game in my current position in my job to be ready", he said.
Trump's political session in West Virginia. Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump opened several political rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five political rallies for Trump over the next five weeks, with stops for friends including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his own nomination for the Supreme Court seat open, Trump hopes to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the House when they sign the bill in Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia political rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling West Virginia rally was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia presidential campaign online, below from a live video on Youtube.
Trump could speak of this week's debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which began to stir up up up up sexual abuse allegations and the expected parliamentary vote to be held for about a week while the FBI was investigating.
But the main goal of many of these political parties was to help the Republican Party in the tough November election and get encouragement.
President Trump's campaign therefore stated that the upcoming five-week rally was to encourage payroll and support, as Republicans tried to preserve and expand their hold on the Lower and Lower House Legislatures relying on Reuters.
The administration of the Legislative Assembly is critical to his plan, so that the president will visit as many countries as possible, as we enter the political era Trump's political spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Featured on Wesbanco Wheeling News, this nightly rally was able to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and drew coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia last month, a state he won by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for West Virginia's legislature Patrick Morrisey, who is on the move in the investigation.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will come to promote him in the poll, said Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the age of struggle to keep hope and enter the single-elimination bracket on Sunday
After three consecutive games, a four-man race on Saturday morning may be the Ryder Cup requirement.
The power of the elevator is entirely a game design discovered but is believed by gamers, which often reflects the similarity of the elevator.
So where would they say that power is now?
They went by six points and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little encouragement, I wonder, Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
European countries have gained, of course, four points ahead and 12 are still in the money.
Americans, Spieth said, felt they had little air on their shoulders and a lot of motivation, not least as Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each would boast three points out of four.
Spieth was injured from a knee injury to a career-ending knee injury and was walking as a walk-on.
The strong cries of the eagle continued as his colours progressed, pushing the ball needed to keep the fourth game on the same line after he and Thomas had hit twice with two moving blocks.
The same kind of screaming sound met him in a fight that gave them a 15th win, a fight that tells you that he believes the Americans have not gotten out of this.
"You'll look inside and miss your own game", Spieth says.
All the players now have the same.
18th hole to mark.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the previous two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup story is undeniable.
The beautiful and unexpected European union is four-fourths unlikely to do anything wrong.
Moliwood was the only non-stop link on Saturday afternoon, but they closed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and closed at 9am on Friday morning.
The side, and the strength coming and going from the rousing crowd proved to be the most desirable players on Sunday, which without another famous player could lead to a European championship as the sun sets at Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to do both at the same time in different spaces.
The glory of Europe has not yet arrived, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson used Sergio Garcia to play a game in a two-man football match in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One pass and nine double-crossed the Spanish and Swedish national into a pit they could not climb.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of your hole.
Two-man and four-man footballs are amazing to watch because of the interaction in the middle of this connection, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the plan changes immediately.
Europeans have so far been successful as a single country and have been a dominant force until the last day but these four figures show that the USA is so aggressive that some, especially the US, are more reluctant to argue.
European nations go 10-6 and enter the Ryder Cup on the final day
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a fat score of 10-6 to United States in a two-man and four-man match on Saturday.
The two inspired players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led by two wins over Tiger Woods in the attempt, with four points to go to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, seeking to retain the trophy they had lost to Hazeline two years earlier, continued the American team's defeat in the morning one-two match, winning the match 3-1.
The US pushed hard on four rounds, and won two more, but they could not reduce the number of victories.
A team called Jim Furyk needed eight points from a 12-hole golf course made by one man on Sunday to hold their winning cup.
Fleetwood was the first new European to win four points in a row since with Molinari, he was named Molliwood after a special weekend in which two teams won by four points in their first four Ryder Cup qualifiers.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-man match, they combined well to defeat Woods in a landslide against new American nationalist Bryson Dechambeau by a 5&4 score.
Woods, who pulled himself into two shots on Saturday showed his skills in the shot put but has lost 19 of 29 shots in one-two balls and four in seven consecutive rounds.
Justin Rose recovered from a two-man morning soccer match, returning to join Henrik Stenson in a four-man race which he beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka-ranked first and third in the world with a 2&1 lead.
Europeans did not get what they wanted, however, on a sunny day in Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American flag with two points on Saturday.
They secured a strong 2&1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a two-man return match to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in a four-man race, having lost in the opening two rounds.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history have a team come back from four points behind to win their first-ever race, despite being the cup holders, a Furyk team only needed to catch a goalie, a goalie to hold their cup.
After two days of fighting, the Sunday attack seemed to outstrip them.
North Korea says it will not be able to withdraw without approval
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions created a lack of confidence in the United States and that their country could not survive its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told an international organization that their annual Summit in North Korea had taken a very important step last year, such as stopping nuclear testing and mines, expanding nuclear testing facilities and pledging not to destroy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any further comments from the U.S he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in such a situation, we will have no way to get our weapons out of the way.
While Ri reversed North Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to conduct a nuclear weapons program under which North Korea would be considered a small-scale nuclear program, his comments were useful because he did not reject the immediate nuclear weapons program as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to the statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump spoke at the first meeting between the incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to see about the "nuclear-cycle" explosion of Korea where Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea was seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States had said that Pyongyang would first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease the international blockade of North Korea.
The U.S. has maintained its commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and has further advanced its recommendation through sanctions to achieve its goals in a strategic manner, and has further adopted the Declaration of the End of the War, Ri said.
The realization that we will be cut off from our prayers is a mere dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the developmental barriers are eroding our confidence.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. president announced at the United Nations that week.
Instead, the minister announced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: If the issue of nuclear survival is addressed to South Korea rather than the U.S., the nuclear survival of the Korean peninsula will not come under this kind of conundrum.
Still, Ri's voice changed dramatically from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that using North Korean rockets to reach the U.S. capital was not possible, as The Bad President Trump called Kim The Rocket Man in the line of duty.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year condemned North Korea's total destruction, praised Kim for his courage in following the nuclear disarmament process, but said that there was still so much work to be done that the ban would remain in place until North Korea stopped nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time for this, saying that if it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should give Pyongyang a handle on their measures.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that the imposition of the Security Council ban will continue vigorously until we have completed the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, at the end.
The Security Council has jointly promoted North Korea's ban since 2006, in a bid to curb funding for its nuclear program and Pyongyang's bombing.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and later told him that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there was no future, only that North Korea would reject him within hours for passing similar laws to the anti-apartheid one.
North Korea pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the mines and nuclear facilities if the United States joined the solution.
He said Kim told him, "The appropriate order" he was seeking was Trump's security pledge to Singapore and to continue to improve relations between Washington.
Harvard students study to get enough rest
Her Harvard University study this year made it difficult for all students to sleep well, causing a long wait to read all night.
One scholar found that students at the world's first university often do not know what is right and come to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Havard Medical School and a professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital organized the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the study after giving a lesson about the effects of sleepless learning.
After that a young woman came to me and said: Why is this being said to me now, since I am a child?
She said no one had ever told her the importance of sleep - which surprised me. she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explained to students how the benefits of good sleep help education and sports, and also improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and university medical director, said the university decided to start the study after it was discovered that students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The study lasted an hour and included a discussion program.
In one section there is a bedroom image, where students sit down with a cup of coffee, a safety net, sports shoes and a book to inform them about the effects of the lights and how sleep deprivation affects sports activities, the benefits of sleep-time programs.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleeplessness caused the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and tuberculosis.
A school map features a dialogue sign, and encourages participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know that he will not change the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know- just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking choices for health, Professor Czeisler added.
The practice of night-time wakefulness, he said, is still alive, along with new technology and the increasing demand for students, which means that sleep deprivation is a serious problem.
Ensuring adequate, healthy sleep should be a student's weapon to combat the stress, fatigue and heartburn, he said - even after completing the intake, sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of extreme hunger, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course, where he had taught a class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and prompted him to push for this education to be available to all schools.
Next, he hopes to invite students who have completed primary school to complete a similar course before entering the school.
Professor Czeisler encourages students to think about putting a hatch for when they need to sleep, and when they need to wake up, and also to be aware of the effects of electronic appliances' screen damage the negative lighting of the screen and LED lighting, which can disrupt the way your body behaves, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga scored the goal against Gerrard
The Rangers suffered a broken leg as Dolly Menga's shot knocked off Steven Gerrard's broken leg in a 1-0 win over Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first straight win since a 4-1 defeat in February at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt side gave Gerrard a second win and won 18 games as manager with eight points above first-team Ladbrokes Premiership side Hearts.
Menga took the lead before seven minutes of the half, and the Rangers without motivation were unlike their own.
With the Rangers down in the sixth, Linvingston climbed to the third and with a goal difference was only behind Hibernian.
That there may be future problems for the Rangers after a Calum Spencem shooter was healed of a head injury, after a measurement of the visitors' side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the side that crossed Ayr to the next round of the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, in turn, took the 11 Livi, which took away a score from the Hearts last week, and that he would have liked how his strong men pursued their enemies everywhere.
The Rangers may have been the best catchers but Livingston was the best receiver.
They had to take two minutes to get to the goal after Menga's first small goal sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGrego's goal, but the midfielder missed his big gap.
Keaghan Jacobs's shot came against goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his starting line-up rival Alan Lithgow could only miss him.
The Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than there was confidence as to how they were playing in the third quarter.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have penalised at the 15th minute of the match against Steven Lawless but the coach Steven Thomson ignored the Columbia's complaint.
Rangers only managed to get to the postseason twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unharmed in the head-stroke and the unsuccessful shot by Ovie Ajaria.
Since the 34th minute goal scored by Levi could be a draw, no one would say that it was a draw for their efforts.
Also the Rangers couldn't touch Jacob's deep end.
Scott Arfield was unable to get Declan Gallagher to turn the ball over to Scott Robinson, who was too slow to pick Menga for the loss.
Gerrard repeated in the offseason as he used Ryan Kent to replace Coulibaly which immediately affected the effect, as the runner-up knocked out Morelos but Kelly's good runner ran from his position and stopped him.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play their favorite sport, while Lithgow and Halkett played a regular game of football.
Holt's side had to extend their win in the final but McGregor had to fight and reject Jacobs, before Lithgow took the lead with the ball to the side.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a complaint about a penalty that did not come in time to meet Jacobs but Thomson looked again.
Almanak: The inventor of the Geiger
Now a page from our Almanak Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Read ... the date of birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhem Hans in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for measuring and measuring the size of radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the Geiger Calculator.
A scientific basis since then, the Geiger Triangle has also become the basis of a new race, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado. Its characters are not as popular as the cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN: WHAT on earth is this thing?
Rogers: It is a Geiger's Cube, used to detect the location of a mineral such as uranium.
When the radio is turned on, you can hear the result of the radioactivity of the atomic radiation in the ground.
Evans: Tell me, it is happening now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery of his name is ahead.
A new seed vaccine can train the immune system to detect cell damage
A new strain of the vaccine can train the immune system to detect and kill damaging cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaging cells as a treatment method
This process involved extracting the protective cell from the patient's body, then converting it into a laboratory
They can detect and retrieve the protein common to many fruit diseases
Test-based vaccines have been shown to satisfy patients with various bacterial infections.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaging cells, saw her vaginal infection go away for more than 18 months.
The method involved extracting the protective cells from the patient, turning them into laboratory proteins, which are common in many stem cell diseases called HER2, and then returning the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland, said: Our results show that we have a satisfactory vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of many fertility diseases, including breast, ovarian, spinal cord and urinary tract diseases, Dr. Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure to removing the protective cells from a patient's body with a newly trained stem cell diagnosis has been used to treat a type of bone marrow disease.
Kanye West went on an angry tour with Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on SNL.
Failure
Kanye West's voice was heard in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a film of his own praise for U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would be appearing in 2020.
After playing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town's Cold Case of Make America Great, he continued to slander Democrats and voiced his support for Trump.
Many times I talked to a white person, they said: How can Trump be liked, who hates a black person?
Indeed, if I had been affected by the practice of hatred of blacks, I would have been out of America. he said.
SNL began the film with a slightly humorous tone, with Matt Damon, as the Hollywood celebrity mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on the alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not being aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the West's angry speech to social media.
It was unclear whether Rock intended to tease West with the message.
Also, West told the audience that his hat was locked behind the house.
They have spoken against me in the backyard.
They told him, "Do not take off your cloak and go away".
They spoke badly of me!
And they said again, that I was in the deep". he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued. "Do you want to see the mystery?" he said, "I'm going to wear my superman suit, which means you don't tell me what to do.
Test the love.
His remarks sparked a stir from viewers at least twice and SNL staff shut the doors, Variety says, quoted by one of the letter's authors: The whole theater was quiet.
West was recruited as a replacement for the late vocalist Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West joined many people in a confused dress-up as Kalama Perrier performed the song I Love It.
West received support from TPUSA's CEO, Candace Turner, who tweeted: For one of the most inspirational: DO NOT TRY TO TRY THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE.
But the film's voice-over artist Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who he is, and this is pretty cool".
But I have been chosen NOT to give a glimpse (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) to someone who I believe is acknowledging and expressing harmful beliefs in society.
He was free.
So we too, he added.
Before the film, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was the first known person to be Kanye West.
He was not the first actor to change his name, joining the footsteps of Diddy, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, has since responded to Snoop Lion, and the more sophisticated rapper Prince, changed his name to Mark and the actor formerly known as Prince.
Charging for attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant was expected to appear in a lower court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Library Service will examine the leaked book.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harrington has been fired for his role as a bad guy
Kit Harrington is known for his knife-throwing role as Jon Snow in the HBO drama Game of Thrones with a horror based on Old Testament ideas.
But the actor, 31, has broken the identity of the heroes, saying that this type of screen-based acting means that boys will feel they need to be tough before they get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "things have gone wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of working with bad men during #MeToo.
Kit, who is married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, is also 31, admits that he is "very upset" about getting involved.
"I personally feel very strongly about it, now - where have we gone from being a man to a man?" he said.
What do we teach boys as they grow up, about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that the cinema has inherited little in the way of male dominance, thanks to male characters in the cinema.
He continued: What is regular and educational?
What is taught in theaters, and in the theater, that makes boys feel that they should be this way with men?
I think that's a big question in our time - how can we change it?
For she has certainly done some harm to our sons.
In the interview he agreed that he would not do the opening or sequel story of Game of Thrones but the show would end next summer, saying that he and the horse fighting game had ended.
From November Kit will appear in the Sam Shepard film True West which is a story about a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor soon announced that he felt meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this movie, so in that way she gave me my family in the future, and my life went on". he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who was loved by Kit and Jon Snow, and later won an Emmy nomination.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie Park in Scotland.
HIV/TB: China's farming pressure is 14% in new cases
China announced it is taking a 14% cut in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and influenza.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the city, health officials say.
Up to 40,000 new words were broadcast in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Much of this new term is sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of HIV infections in this way has dropped to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Over the years, however, the number of people infected with HIV and influenza has risen by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious issue among LGBT Chinese.
The legalization of homosexuality in China was lifted in 1997, but LGBT discrimination remains high.
Because of the city's safety standards, research studies predict that up to 70-90% of men who have sex will eventually marry women.
Many of the infections are transmitted through the lack of adequate sexual coverage in the making of these friends.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide a vaccine against HIV as part of its efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied that her employee was the one who sent the data to the GOP lawmakers, denouncing the nightmare and the conspiracy.
U.S. Lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees included the personal information of three U.S. Republican lawmakers on the Wikipedia lawsuit page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the accusers were members of the ultra-right wing and webmasters.
Hate, hate, and hate is evil, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided contained a home address and phone number for U.S. Congressman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The message appeared online on Thursday, anonymously posted on Capitol Hill during the Congress debate over sexual charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The flag appeared when three lawbreakers questioned Kavanaugh.
Standard security sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate announced that the IP address used to determine where the information was leaked was associated with Waters' company, and released information from Waters' user, Hill announced.
This absurd accusation is completely false and complete hatred, Waters continued.
My employee, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false accusations - had nothing to do with the message.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and utter hatred.
Waters' statement immediately sparked outrage online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is outrageous,  Fleischer writes.
This means that there is no such spirit as the Lawgiver.
When someone is offended, they should not be angry.
They should not argue.
They should not question the accuser's motives.
They should be calm and calm.
It came as Fleischer was criticizing Waters' behavior and the Democrats' slander against Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly taking a big hit during a debate on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican who sought to remove Waters' seat during the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
Big if true, he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said his company had informed the authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false allegations.
We will see that those who have done it will be exposed, he goes on and they will be held in law for all their harmful and terrible acts against the person and all my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again interview - directed by Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to seek the need for Brexit in any new British-influenced film, and this as it relates to the Johnny English comedy-drama - which was adapted by Johnny English starting in 2003, and then returned in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Does that mean that the comedy about how we were stupid is now a new marketplace?
Even the foolish, plastic-faced Johnny English has changed his ability to promote a second time - his name more than anything indicates that it is a comedy idea designed for non-English speaking parts of the world.
He was indeed a secret agent who, however intricate, had a small Clouseau, a small Mr Bean and a man's introduction to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The plot revolves around the traveling and international spy Atkinson who was cast in a Barclaycard TV commercial that was forgotten, sparking a riot.
There is one or two beautiful times in this new JE.
I was fascinated by Johnny English's approach to the airport, where he was wearing old-fashioned military uniforms and a vacuum cleaner.
Atkinson's gift for visual humor is brilliant, but the humor is not strong and overly intense, and even the non-comic films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves have a sense of humor in them now.
The childish comedy was more intended for adults, for me Johnny English tour had no special premise and was intended as a silent film by Atkinson, the son of Bean.
The main focus now is that Great Britain is in trouble.
An Internet intruder has been unauthorized into Britain's most secretive intelligence network, exposing all of the operational intelligence personnel, and the confusion of the operational intelligence personnel - a minor event for Kelvin Eldon.
It was the last for a troubled, arrogant president, who no longer had any government support at all: Emma Thompson tried her hand at a similar Teresa-May event but had no book to work with.
His security advisers told him that since all his secret services were known, he would call out a retired person.
That meant Johnny English was a self-proclaimed liberal, who was employed as a teacher in the schools of the wealthy, but offered lessons that were not literate as this was a secret service: he was a very good writer here, as English gave to the type of secret school School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for providing a briefing and the second person to commit suicide at Bough's torture, Ben Miller, did it again.
Bough has been married, linked to a water gunner, a move by Vicki Pepperdine's colored man who made him an alcoholic.
So Batman and Robin's constantly ruining Her Majesty's Secret Service has begun, meeting Olga Kurylenko as the successor Ophelia Bulletova.
Kosila, the president of the magic-loving tech giant, who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta's villain Jake Lacy did it.
English and Bough embarked on a journey of their own absurd comedy: transformed as a cook, lit a French restaurant fire; they caused a stir to hide themselves in a Volta holiday boat; English stirred up confusion as he tried to use Virtual Reality's main app to identify the Volta room.
The final round was all-purpose, but all the fun and games were in it, and there were small children's TVs in all of it.
Everything is not perfect.
Like other Johnny English films, I was not bothered to wonder: could not British actors give Rowan Atkinson a performance that would bring out his talent well?
Labour denies that they are not negotiating plans as British workers work four days a week and receive five days' wages
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is proposing a change that would ensure that Britons work four days a week for their five-day paycheck.
The group wants the owners of companies that transfer their assets to employees through artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them a day off work.
It would provide workers with three days' pay per week and a month's salary.
The speakers said the idea would be in line with the group's economic objectives and plans to make it fit for the working class.
Trades Union Congress members have approved a four-day weekly launch as a way for workers to gain exposure to the changing economy.
A Labour Party spokesman told the Sunday Times: An announcement of a predictive review is expected before the end of this year.
It will not be done immediately but working four days a week is the objective of the organisation in line with the economic reforms to accommodate the workforce and the collection of the organisation's industrial resources.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 political season.
The Labour Party does not currently support the aim as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: Four-day work a week is not a party's prediction that the party does not consider.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his vision for change and prosperity.
Ms. McDonnell said she decided to recover the rights from unknown corporate heads and high-value investors in the residential industry.
The shadow chancellor's plan also meant that shareholders in the water industry could not get their capital, as the Labour government could make a shortage on the basis of wrong intentions.
He also announced plans to put employees on board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would transfer 10 percent of the shares of public companies to employees, who could receive a capital gain of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said 60 minutes whether the FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final election and his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions that the agency's investigation could change the minds of Republican lawmakers and withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, reporter 60 Minutes Scott Pelley asked Republican Lawmakers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could raise any objections to their convictions.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I wonder, yes, Kennedy said.
I was told to enter the debate, I was told, I was told, I was told by Justice Kavanaugh.
I called him later, and when the accusation came out, he said, 'YOU did it?
It is not broken, it is decisive, and it is unquestionable.
Graham's vote, of course, as written.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, that he'll take the blame", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know why but I know this: Brett was very much against it, Graham added, reaching out to Christine Blasey Ford.
But none of those who were called believed him.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Program, and has it been doing anything to reduce visits?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that features a lineup of famous and amazing actors, with an amazing purpose; to stop the immigration.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people meet at Ama Central Park, who not only enjoy the performances of actors like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, but also promote awareness of the real purpose of the program to stop migration by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival which was announced in 2012, is a branch of the Global Poverty Project, an international policy-making organization that hopes to stop poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (see if you wish to pay a ticket), the people who come to the show will perform certain activities, or do things like get a job, email the mayor, make a phone call or any other useful way to raise awareness of their intention to stop coming.
But how does it succeed for Global Citizen when they have only 12 years to implement its goals?
The idea of giving people free tickets, is this the right way to get people to make factory calls, or is it just another way called kliktivizm - people who think they have something special they're actually doing by signing an online complaint or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that they have produced 19 million pieces by its sponsors, claiming for the achievement of various goals.
He said these technologies have helped to make international governments announce commitments and forecasts of over $37.0 billion, which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group signed a pledge that 390 levels of production from its plants, at least $10 billion of which have been distributed or measured in cash, would be paid.
The same predicts the number of safe havens that have affected the lives of 649 million people around the world.
Some pledges including Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based fundraising partnership and volunteer workers to help children grow up to be what they will be, pledged Rwanda $35 million to help them end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With support from the UK Government, donors and foreign governments, and Global Citizen like you, we will make the misuse of malnutrition a supplement to hysteria. Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a music festival in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 production units were completed, calling on the U.K. to improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a project funding, Power of Nutrition, which will use the nutrition aid to reach 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the FAQs is on his internet, asking, why do we think we can stop the mass influx?
Global Citizen answered: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail and fail.
But, as the extreme political rights of the people and the anti-racism that happened before us, we will win, because we are stronger and united.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the actors at this year's festival in New York, which will be co-hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for the blockade to prevent Russian power market transfers- Local Press Release
Washington could use its Navy to block Russian market access, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke accused Russia's involvement in Syria - famously, where it operates under the influence of legitimate governments - of being a fraudulent way to investigate the renewable energy market.
"I believe the reason they stayed in the Middle East was to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the European continent", he said.
But, depending on the employee, there is still a way to fight it.
The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that our waterways are open, if necessary, closed, to ensure their power is not commercially viable. he said.
Zinke told the audience gathered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, the group does not seek a profit that has established itself as the "voice of consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's treatment of Russia and Iran, finding that the two were identical.
Iran's economic option with Russia is, dependent solely, on the loan and recovery of fuel for cars, he said, referring to Russia as a "threat group" with an economy based on fuel and dirt created globally.
The announcements mean that the Trump administration is trying to promote the transfer of its natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is still cheap for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to force Germany to conclude that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which was based on Trump, was wrong and that Berlin was used by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only a project for the economy.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's over-imposition of the plan was solely due to economic factors and was a poor strategic plan.
I believe we agree that power cannot be a tool for making recommendations, consumers should choose their customer, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following his meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been echoed by Germany, which has also expressed its support for the plan.
The German industrial regulator, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from the European energy policy and the city-state agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I was in a serious situation when the third country was focusing on our energy market", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Look Very CloselyTo Run for President in 2020, said the Massachusetts legislator
Massachusetts lawmaker Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be more careful to run for president, following a midterm election.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren also announced that he would run for office.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which has put women at the top. he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, the presidential election will be very much watched.
Warren spoke to President Donald Trump during the city's congress, saying he was leading the country in a bad way.
"I am very curious about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren is expressing his condemnation of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday Warren said we really need an FBI investigation before the election.
A survey released on Thursday, however, showed that many of Warren's electoral leaders did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' voters said the bill should not be voted on, according to a survey by Suffolk University Poilitical Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting him while 48 percent opposing him.
Major Democratic names have spoken out about the 2020 election cycle including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his own decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin referred to PTSD Track Palin at a Donald Trump political rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the country in September.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
What my son is going through, what he is going through and the backlash, I can get other family understandings about the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries we're going through in the military, she told the crowd at this rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her friend in the house and spoke of her son and other military veterans, who returned slightly different, returned bold, and asked if there was respect for his fellow soldiers, air force, and all members of the military, for what they had given to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, prevention and complaints of domestic violence and use of firearms as a drug, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
City 18, D.C. prepares to fight the new refugee crisis
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in favor of fighting the legalization of a new U.S. policy that does not provide protection for refugees who are fleeing group violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 cities and districts filed related aid claims on Friday in Washington to support a refugee who was awaiting the proposal, NBC News reported.
The full list of plaintiffs in the August case Grace v. Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been released.
She claimed to have been abused by her roommate and her sons' gang, but U.S. officials closed her petition for asylum on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Civil attorneys who support Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, produced the highest number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as the country battles increasing gang violence and domestic violence.
A new U.S. proposal revises the 2014 decision made by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to admit undocumented immigrants who are fleeing domestic violence to apply for life-saving asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday's announcement that the new policy "ignores the domestic, federal and international laws of the year".
Federal law requires that any refugee's decision and complaint be made on the basis of evidence and circumstances of the complaint, which in the form of a detention is contrary to the legal framework, requires the relevant documents to be issued.
Lawyers continue to argue in their paper that the policy to restrict foreigners from entering is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are often independent contractors and provide needed contractors.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered foreign-rights judges to reduce the security of refugees fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
The protection of life-saving refugees for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or political affiliation, Sessions said in his June 11 announcement.
The safety of refugees has not been designed to address all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face around the world.
Tired efforts to rescue survivors in Palu as death toll rises
For those who have fled an emergency, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very thoughtful", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her trembling son in the refugee camp in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is scarce.
The villagers were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up water-filled containers, trying to save whatever they could.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals were filled with damage from the 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulders, were in front of the Palu Army Hospital to rest, where the injured were being treated for the severe earthquake that was still ongoing.
He wept as he reported the devastating earthquake that hit the fifth floor of his hotel with his wife and daughter.
There is no room for self-sacrifice.
I thought I was in a dead end, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then I heard her calm down.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are well.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "opposition" through "media hatred"
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page article in a U.S. newsletter about U.S.-China trade relations, a U.S.-China ambassador accused Beijing of hating American media.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday pointed to the paid addition of the China Daily and Des Moines Register - Iowa's top-selling state newspaper - after he accused China of seeking to participate in the U.S. legislative elections on November 6, a charge China denied.
Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to interfere in U.S. elections show what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new trend in Washington's growing support for China.
As the core of foreign governments' efforts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in increasing trade policy that has led them to impose tariffs on their imported goods.
China's tax cuts at the start of the trade war are designed to affect exporters as Iowa supports a Republican Trump policy, U.S.-China intelligence officials said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who was a major exporter of farm produce to China, said China had hurt American workers, farmers and commerce.
China, Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "emphasizing the opposition by including advertising in our newsletter".
In the hate speech, the Chinese government took the American cultural space that democracy and non-violent media favored and put paid advertising in the Des Moines Register. Branstad writes.
But considering the position of the Beijing street press here, the presence of such a small volume of discrepancies would be a real indication of the potential differences in Chinese views on the troubled Chinese economy, where the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers had to publish his writing, although he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Republicans Ban Women from Voting Before Midterm Elections for Kavanaugh's Riot, Investigators Warn
As many Republican leaders stood up and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against various sexual abuse charges, investigators have warned that they will see a wave of anger, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reaction that followed was so high, that many Republicans were recorded as having expressed a desire to continue to vote.
Those facts cannot be recovered, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School told The Hill about a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was also challenging the final step taken by Lawmaker Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be enough to calm voter outrage.
Women will not forget what happened - they will not forget the rest of the day until November,  Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and public speaker for MoveOn's Progress Forum said on Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted November is Coming! as they marched along the way of the National Assembly where Republicans chose to continue with the Kavanaugh nomination by the Legislature despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic announced.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be different, Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with whom he has no ties, told reporters.
People say it is too high; this is true.
But it can be particularly confusing between women without a local council and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, as the president dislikes, do not vote regularly.
Even before Ford's public statement of sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, investigators speculated that outbursts of anger could be avoided if Republicans continued to support the motion.
"This has been a turmoil for the GOP", said Michael Steele, the head of the Republican One Party, at the beginning of the crackdown, according to NBC News.
Not only about the congressional elections or the last election or whether Kavanaugh was elected, but also how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated him, Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a Democratic nominee organization, contacted reporters.
After all, Americans seemed divided as to who would agree with the Ford and Kavanaugh declarations, while the overarching party sided with the latter.
A recent YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of respondents agreed with or somewhat agreed with Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they agreed with or somewhat with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably hated or hated him completely during his confession, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's appeal, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations, along with at least one other alleged, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the House Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunk on her at age 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court appointee of showing his power when they held a restaurant conference while students at Yale during the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Developer Announces a New Internet to Join Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that will follow Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new initiative of the state-of-the-art technology, Inrupt, is a firm that is backed by Berners-Lee's open source software firm Solid.
Solid gives users the freedom to choose where to store their data and information that people can access.
In a special interview conducted by Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind the creation of Inrupt was global power.
We will do it now, he said of the new building.
It's time to get in the news.
The application uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create an online personal database or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a list of events, a calendar, a music album and a personal and professional application.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of an online personal database is that it is up to the user to choose who will receive each individual information.
The company calls it "personal data privacy".
Inrupt's mission, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the right infrastructure, techniques and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company had only Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-acquired memory, designers hired to work on the project and volunteer coding communities.
From this week, tech makers around the world will be able to create their own non-compilation apps using a virtual app on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team did not talk to the Facebook and Google about whether they would launch or abandon the start of the change altogether as business models were turning instantly.
We do not accept their permission.
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's purpose is to provide business and environmental empowerment to help maintain the trust and integrity of the newly created Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a vocal voice in the debate over Internet freedom.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain as the developer and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am very hopeful for the future that has come, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Victoria Cross for the First World War
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier in his hometown has turned 100.
Lt. Col. Pastor Bernard Vann was ordained on September 29, 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was shot dead by a sophisticated rifle and was hit by Britain's largest army eagle.
Two of her sons unveiled a memorial stone at a rally in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was a very special sign that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather had used his power to obtain the throne.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through a black cloud and into a large fire of ammunition and guns.
He then ran into the gunmen and then led the line before shooting himself and killing three separate soldiers.
A German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing he knew would not happen with soap but it was something that made a person humble".
He and his brother Dr James Vann added a memorial flower after the siege, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was very happy and honored to be part of the parade and said that the support of the people showed respect for the power of the real hero.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but got Peppa Pig
Imagine waking up all night with a full Bellator 206, only to be denied the chance to watch the festivities.
A letter from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and showed him performing all night on UK Channel 5.
At 6am, as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald wanted to talk face-to-face, the UK audience was confused about the change to Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy with the fact that they had been awake all night long and had even been anxious about the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the change to the children's show as "a big joke".
"It was official that at 6 a.m. the film was not suitable for children, so they went into the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, deputy director of marketing and advertising for Bellator, when asked for the film's screening.
Peppa the Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work on their plans to add UK filmmakers in the future.
"I wonder when I think about the movement, I think we can probably fix it", Coker said.
But it was six o'clock Sunday morning and we couldn't fix it until our Sunday, their Monday.
But we are working on it.
I agree, when he changed the subject, there were so many texts going back and forth that they were all not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical fault.
But no, it is a matter of government.
I promise you that it will never happen again.
We will reduce it to five struggles instead of six - as we usually do - that we try to give the supporters what they need and then go beyond.
It was a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: It's about Tom Daley as a sexist
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said he had developed feelings of being uncomfortable with anyone because of his sexual orientation - but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that there was no one like him.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about the rights of gay people to give others hope.
He also said that fatherhood made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show host, Kirsty Young, has been out for a few months due to a death.
Appearing as a contestant on Laverne's first show, Daley said she was treated as "less than anyone else" when she grew up because of "not being accepted in social relationships as gay".
He said: To this day, the feeling of being unqualified, and the feeling of being different, are the things that have empowered me to succeed.
She wanted to prove herself, she said, so as not to upset everyone when they find out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an LGBT activist, and with her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, she has called on many other countries to eliminate sexual misconduct.
He said he spoke because he felt he was fortunate enough to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man - the US actor, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - made him a hero.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who took 20 years to complete her, last year but said their age difference never made a difference.
After going through a lot in his childhood - attending his first Olympics at age 14 - his father died of tuberculosis three years later - he said that it was hard to find a one-year-old who had the same level of experience and low profile as him.
The two became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June- which Daley said changed his perception.
If you asked me last year, it was just about winning the gold medal.
And, you know, there's more to the Olympics than gold.
My gold is Robbie.
Her son, whose name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said her father did not agree with her death, and one of her last questions was whether they had bought their tickets for London 2012 - as she wanted to be on the show.
I can't tell her she won't live to see her face.
I held his hand to stop breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I accepted that he was not dying, he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I know this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to force and tear in front of my family's crowd at the Olympic Games, no more impact", he said.
It inspired her first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which was relevant to her during the Olympics' sponsorship and shock.

Mickelson was left out of a badly contested Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he hits his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will turn his form around to avoid being a disappointing achievement.
Captain Jim Furyk replaced Mickelson, playing the program's 12th consecutive two-year, single-elimination game on Saturday for two-man and four-man teams.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he had been for the United States, the five-time champion set out to be a punter and fix his game in the hope of improving his condition.
Never a top-flight hitter even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a fan of Le Golf National's iconic style, where the tall hitter strikes with a long, unpunished punch.
And although the star is not afraid of himself, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari with a successful shot, who along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, starting a 12-man game with four points in a row, start a hot match, Mickelson's game could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in himself, not that he had anything else to say.
"He picked his job carefully today, slapped me in the back and said, 'I'll be ready tomorrow,'" Furyk said.
He had great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Fame member, and he has added a lot to the group this past week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but this is how it came about and how we thought we were going.
He wanted to be in front of it, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may be the lowest finish of his Ryder Cup career.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence brought about the same ineffable.
He is funny, funny, funny, he likes to make fun of people, he is a good person to have in this group room, he explained.
I think the young players were happy to annoy him this week, which was a pleasure to see.
It offers more than just playing games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that a large lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that getting a big first-round score on the final day of the Ryder Cup can turn into a disagreeable boat.
The Danishman first appeared in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the Seven Ballesteros side captained by five points across the Americans but could only cross the finish line with their nose in front of them through a small hole, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You'll try to remember yourself by going with a big score at Valderrama; we went with a big score at Brookline, where we won, and at Valderrama where we won but it was a little bit", Bjorn said, after watching the Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, going 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the hysteria would show me that everyone in the group is still here.
You will try hard tomorrow.
Get out of there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you receive the mark on the stick.
Our goal is to try and win this cup of victory, and that is where our eyes are set.
I've said before, I'm keeping an eye on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world.
Delighted with the players' performance in the tough golf, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to run too fast on this.
Tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow is a one-man event coming up, and that's a different thing to do.
It's good to have a partner there when things are going well, but when you're alone there, then you'll be fully tested like a golfer.
That is the message you need to convey to athletes, to bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now, leaving your partner behind will also bring out the best.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk's face-to-face numbers would require his players to do better on their own than they did on their own, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was at the end of the great day of the revolution, having won the first victory at Brookline before becoming the European champion.
I remember all his words, he answered a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 gathered his team into the final day.
We have 12 important matches all day tomorrow, but it would be nice to start strong as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When he crosses a highway, he gets a big hit in the middle of the game.
We line up our lines and put our own in the way we like, we know, we try to do magic all morning.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and guarding Rory McIlroy in the lead, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the lead.
I took one of these guys because I thought I had it all, Bjorn said of one of his color choices.
Germany again carried new weapons
A new German Navy Frigate was to be deployed in 2014 to replace the Cold War's more advanced weapons, but it will not be available until at least next year due to poor systems and high cost, local media announced.
The deployment of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem of its delivery followed the plan.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates sold by the Navy in 2007 will come as a replacement for the Bremen-class frigate.
It was understood that they would have a very powerful main gun, various air-to-air missiles and naval mines as well as some classified technologies, such as radar, infrared and sound compatibility.
Other important work included a long repair period - it should have been possible to deploy the new frigates up to two years away from the port.
However, this delay meant that the unique weapon - which was supposed to give Germany a chance to show off abroad - would be obsolete when they started work, Die Zelt suggested.
The F125 was in the news last year when the German Navy refused to commission the frigate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned ships and their crews to the port.
Little is known about the reasons for its re-export, but German media pointed to a few factors software and hardware damage  that were critical, so the weapon was useless if shipped to war.
The software was not enough because 120 sailors would pilot the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class - only half of the crew were in the Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it also meant that the ship was too big to carry out its task force and prevented the Navy from adding future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz used twice as much weight as the other ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from poor hardware, the overall cost of the project - including the availability of drivers - is also a concern.
It is said that the €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) has been raised - up from the previous €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates were especially important because of the recent warning that the German Navy was declining in strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German security council, announced that the Navy had no longer any ships capable of deployment.
The worker said the issue had grown more pressing over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no ships were taken in to replace them.
He insisted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the Navy.
The National Trust has paid attention to the secret life of the mouse
A new study in a park in the Scottish Highlands sought to show how the deadly swarm was used to store food.
The discovery is expected to shed light on the unique behavior of mammals and help to shape future conservation efforts.
The course, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland's scientific researchers, will follow the famous pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared in Daubenton and Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders would be placed near a vital area around the park to keep track of these bands' activities at all times.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a roaming test using a handheld tracking device.
A sound check of the sound of all records will show the frequency of calls and what each type is doing.
Land maps and archives would be created to provide a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, global safety consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show the most critical aspects of the habitat and how each species uses it.
This information will help to make decisions about the proper management of habitat management activities such as grassland production and how best to protect forest land from mosquitoes and other related species.
The number of registered voters in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen sharply over the past decade.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect the environment and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as can flypaper and some chemical protection devices used in construction, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Of course, the fly did not lose its head.
Even so, because of the habit of cooking at night, their ears are more important than their eyes when it is time to catch prey.
They use sound detection to detect pests and traps in their worship.
NTS, which is responsible for overseeing more than 270 old buildings, 38 important fields and 76,000 hectares of land in the suburbs, calls the cattle a vital asset.
He had ten trained fishermen who regularly checked the area, checking the bed and sometimes rescuing.
The company has set up a special site in Scotland dedicated to the first Threave camp in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten types of troops inhabited Scotland are located.
Park manager David Thompson said that the park was the best place for them.
In Threaves here, we have a beautiful side for the muses, he said.
We had an old house, a wood frame and all the good houses.
But there is still much to be learned about the cats, so the work we do here and in other camps will help us understand more about what they need to live well.
He also said that it is important to take care of the floodgates before the renovation of the residential area because a single mother-child sleeping area could be inadvertently disturbed, could kill up to 400 women and their children, could wipe out all the population living there.
It is also a crime to kill, torture, or disturb a person's sleeping area.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee for the Bat Conservation Trust, has given public support to get involved.
He said: We still have much to learn about our fungi and our many species, which we do not know how many live.
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers file a pro-German press suit
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape a "fake news", claiming that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers have been in favor of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room, in 2009.
He was accused of paying him $375,000 to calm down, Der Spiegel announced Friday.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram Live after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the story a "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, a false story, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is common.
They wanted to be known by my name, but it was part of this work.
I was a cheerful and kind person, the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a Der Spiegel complaint over the allegations, which they called "unreceptive" for investigations into the secret life, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would receive a penalty for violating the  rate of damage, which is probably one of the biggest violations of personal rights in years to come.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the gym, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he assaulted him violently, according to a filing with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo had made a mistake after the accusation and told him that he was 99% good person 1% disappointed.
The book states that Ronaldo believed they had sex but everyone agreed.
Mayorga also admitted that he had gone to the police and photographed his injuries in hospital, but later agreed to not go to court due to the "marvelous revenge" and the "consciousness of protecting him from being raped in the kingdom".
The 34-year-old said she wanted the settlement reversed as she was still suffering from the consequences of the accusation.
Ronaldo was looking to join Real Madrid from Manchester United the season the crash happened, and this summer he went to the top Italian club, Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be disappointed if carmakers lose their cars
The UK would be very saddened if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "unfortunate" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal, Mr Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the outcome of a delayed Brexit deal could lead to a layoff.
Burnaston's factory - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced up to 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers are worried about leaving the EU without a deal as cross-border trade will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for the record, said it would close its Small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern about the car manufacturers' claims is the risk of a sale failure if no agreement is reached.
Production is done in Toyota's straight-line line, while the 37-minute car parts are delivered by suppliers, both in the UK and EU for its sheep car.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a civil unrest which the factory said could lead to delays and insufficient car parts.
It is unlikely that Toyota will leave more than a day's worth of products at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, as production will stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for their future relationship with the EU was designed to meet all the challenges of the EU.
"We want to have a deal. We want to have a better deal that gives us a space as I say, which is not only to make progress now but let's also hold this space", he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that a fully successful marketing strategy should be continued.
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but they warn that the additional rate will reduce its fuel capacity and eventually the work will be terminated.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of a factory team, said that his team misses him very much: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
An official spokesperson said: We have put forward a clear and confident plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein may meet again, the White House said
The crucial meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to next week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein's special agent Robert Mueller is an investigator of Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and the closure of the presidential impeachment proceedings.
But Trump would be prosecuted for leaving the deputy chief justice, so threatening Mueller's freedom, fueling Washington's fears and rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wiretapping to record Trump's debate and removal of the president from the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this story.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid complaints that he wanted to get drunk.
Instead, a meeting between Trump, who is at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosentein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a meeting of Kavanaugh's Assembly judges and one of the women who accused him of corruption, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump issued a week-long FBI investigation order for charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full run-up to the Assembly election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosentein meeting, he said: "Don't set a date for that, it might be next week, and I think that's back a week because of everything that's happening now in the city's highest court.
But we'll see, I always like to let the media know what's happening right away.
Some journalists will draw the line: Sanders has not been White House editor since September 10.
Superintendent Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the editorial shortage was due to the disdain for the "big search for attention" of TV journalists, though he said: "I don't really believe they are looking for too much attention".
He compared the direct communication between Trump and the media to be up.
The president has more time for interviews than any president who has come before him, he said, adding that without citing evidence: We have looked at these numbers.
Reporters will be there, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to interview the president of the United States directly, it's better to talk to me.
We've tried to do that many times, you've seen us do that a few weeks ago, and that will replace the editor when you can speak to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends interviews or press conferences when there are foreign officials.
Social media alone is not uncommon.
In New York this week the president probably explained why, in the face of appearances and bad, sometimes bad appearances in front of the press.
Health document to EU officials in NHS Scotland about the threat of Brexit
The Health Service has issued a letter to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and request to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within three months to the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the costs of the application for citizenship for EU citizens in its separate social services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: In the summer, the links between the UK and the EU and the negotiations have progressed, and this is about to reach a much anticipated conclusion.
But the UK Government is also re-establishing its support for a no-deal situation.
I know this will be a frustrating time for you to be together.
That is why I want to declare my great gratitude to all the workers for their help, regardless of their country.
My colleagues come from across the EU, and across, bringing the necessary experience and skills to expand and improve the performance of the healthcare sector, and helping our patients and our teams and professionals.
Scotland is really you, we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie Passes the Surgery After Healing from a Head Wound
Tennessee State Tigers coach Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering an injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, which was scored by Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly after the halftime game.
He came to the side and laid there, Reed said.
Trainees and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen to the area before he was placed on probation and took him back for further testing.
A Tennessee State employee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no specific information about the extent of the injury in Tennessee State and attempts to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the college in a red dress, was in his first year at Tennessee State after moving across Illinois.
He had five strikeouts on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his annual strikeout to 18.
Foreign traders will still be paid a higher stamp fee when they buy assets in the UK
Foreign businessmen will be paid a higher stamp fee when they buy assets in the UK and use the money above to help the homeless under the Tory scheme
The move would undermine the progress of Corbyn's campaign to attract voters and grow
Tax-free stamps will be paid in the UK
The Bank expects to raise £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreign businessmen are required to pay a high stamp fee when they buy property in the UK - the money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
That would be seen as an attempt to undermine the progress of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract voters to younger generations by promising more affordable housing and chasing out those who earn higher wages.
Stamp duty will be paid to individuals and tax-exempt companies in the UK, and the above amount will increase the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge - which is an addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in the second house and buy-for-lease - can reach up to three percent.
The Bank expects to raise £120 million a year.
It was decided that 13 percent of non-UK residents were buying new London properties, raising the costs and making it difficult for first time buyers to progress in the housing sector.
Most of the city's affluent areas - more than the capital - have a quiet urban environment due to the high number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the city.
The new law comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty to help young people get their first home.
He accused the major manufacturing companies of keeping the resources at high prices by taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to leave the majority of the cheap houses to settle the British housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn has announced housing reform measures and attracted attention, including housing payments management and the elimination of evictions not human blame.
He also wanted to give more councils permission to build new buildings.
Mrs May said: Last year I announced that I would step down to restore the British dream - the life that should be better for any new race.
But that meant repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start living here.
However, it cannot be good that it is easy for people and institutions in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens and idols.
For many people, the dream of having their own home is already near at hand, and the pollution of homelessness is already a viable thing.
Jack Ross: My greatest desire is to manage Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his biggest ambition was to become Scotland's leader once.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted to be fighting to win back a North-East League, who are currently third in League One, three points below the top.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer to take St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play football for my country as a player.
I got a cap B that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland and Hampden many times, and my father and I were kids, and it always reminded me.
The opportunity would come, however, if I did well in team management.
Those who came before Ross as Sunderland's manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gue Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the big names, after rejecting requests from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
How can I make progress in the Premier League?
Due to the platforms and structure of the club, there is no doubt that it should be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get back there, but I can only be found successful here if I can bring the same back there.
Ross was only three years into his managerial career, shortly after becoming an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay with the Hearts staff.
He went on to help Alloa recover from their third-place defeat, and turned St Mirren from the top of the table to the Championship title the following year.
But Ross said he was more relaxed now than he had been when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It might be a good connection, he thought, to take over the authority at Alloa.
I really believe that control is better for me than painting.
It seemed bad because I was good, lived a good life, and had some good visions.
But painting is hard.
There are many things you can go through each week.
I still go through that in terms of the difficulty and stress of the job but the management is good.
At first I wanted to do control, now I do, it gives me the most relaxed feeling, I am myself and my whole adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The best time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, a survey said
The summer heat has cost Britain's declining pubs but has added to the problems of the restaurant business.
A bar saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant ratings fell 4.8 percent, the figure showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business advisors, who cited the figures, said: "The sun is still on and England's participation in the World Cup is so long that July follows a similar pattern to last June, when bars rose 2.8 percent, unless the restaurants were in a serious slump.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
One of the most successful bars is about the same size as a restaurant.
Bars and food stores suffered in the sun, but not as much as those in restaurants.
It was like people were going out for a drink.
Sales of wine in these bars increased 6.6 percent for the month, while food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and care researcher said: "These results follow the pattern we have seen since late April.
The atmosphere and the impact of large-scale gatherings or games still have a major impact when it comes to out-of-home markets.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fail, yet a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be a major blow to the current debt crisis.
The long summer heat may not come at a bad time for food vendors, but time will tell if the temperature is fairly good this August will bring some required holidays.
The overall sales growth across bars and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a decline in new business activity.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business analysis for UK bars, pubs and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 websites, with a combined interest rate exceeding £9 billion, which is the company's benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social network account that they keep from their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - has a social networking account with their parents and teachers, a survey showed
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of fake Instagram
The report has raised fears that sexual content is being leaked
Twenty percent of students said they have a isi account to prove to parents
One in five children - some under 11 - establishes a social network account that they often share with adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts - references to Instagram photo-sharing sites.
The report has raised fears that sexual content is being leaked.
Twenty percent of students said they also use a clean account to tell their parents, but that there is also a confidential one.
A mother went to a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter was seen being attacked by a girl and other clothes.
The survey, from Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had dual profiles, with half believing they had a confidential account.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It is scary that many young people are trying to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the contestants in the Scottish Championship seats
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the board of directors of the Scottish Competition Authority as a director and non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated competitor, and manager Ian Beattle described the injury as a great opportunity for the team to take a look at his experience of the international stage over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected across the competitive ranks in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that the competition in Scotland will gain a great deal of attention by introducing him to their seat, Beattie said.
Doyle said: I enjoy working as a competitor's voice, and I hope I can really help and help lead the game in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta in her Olympic gold medal class, now a BBC specialist, is unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: A month ago today I was paralyzed.
He is unable to walk.
The doctors only said when I could recover or how much I would have reached.
It was a lot of work, but I got back to full-fledgedness, learned to walk, and today I'm working hard!
Thank you for the message of heartfelt thanks!
Milk ransom ads and discussions of mothers and cows divided online views
The dairy industry has divided the Internet by using advertising and comparing mothers and their dairy cows.
To identify the beginning of what was to be the world's first concealed-wear milk delivery, consumer technology company Elvie launched a video and music ad on three days to demonstrate the new delivery freedom for mothers.
Four good mothers dancing in a cow's barn full of cows have words like: Yes, I extract my milk, but you won't find any young If you haven't figured out these aren't cows, these are my milk.
The fear continued: Release her, I feed the little ones, I deliver her, I deliver her, my daughters, I deliver milk.
After all, the ad, which had been posted on the company's Facebook page, had caused problems on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of promotional comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, with most claiming to make the dairy industry's risks less visible.
Great wrong decision to use cattle to spread the message of this product.
Like us they would become pregnant and give birth to milk, only to have enough of their babies stolen within a few days of their birth, wrote one writer.

Another wrote: A deeply felt fear for mother and child.
But why not use them to spread the message of milk ransom for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?
Another added There was no advertising.
Others spoke for the ad, and one woman believed that the fear had left her in a state of shock.
I thought this was a very nice talk.
I could buy one if I was breastfeeding.
The ransom made me feel like a bull.
The advertisement was a bit crazy, but it was there.
This is a product of great intelligence, one author.

This is not a commercial or a milk industry case.
At the end of the video one of the women showed that they had been dancing for a long time but there was a ransom hidden in their bra.
The understanding that supported the campaign was based on the understanding that most women in breastfeeding said they felt like cows.
The Elvie Rescue kit was a fully concealed, knotted, or braced, bra that was hidden in the baby-sitter's bra, giving women a handkerchief to walk around, hold their baby, and go out to milk.
Ana Balarin, partner at ECD and Mother commented: Elvie's product is a new and exciting product that needs to be launched and inspired.
By differentiating between women in childcare and cattle in milk production we need to put the milk pump and all its struggles into focus, and by showing a novel and accessible way, the effect of the greater freedom that the new pump will bring.
This was not the first time Elvie's ransom had been controversial.
During the London Creation Week, a mother of two appeared to have opened a path for the artist Marta Jakubowski to use the product.
Hundreds of Children Fleeing Small Towns to the Gardens of Tartarus in the Texas Highlands
The number of children who have been arrested and taken into custody has increased and although the monthly border crossing has not changed much, due to the Trump administration's strong declarations and policies that have made it harder to keep children in the hands of supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters of the refugees themselves had no record, fearing to violate their right to remain in the city by coming forward to rescue a child.
The threat escalated in June, when the federal authorities announced that supporters could come along with other family elders to hand in fingerprints, and that their data would be shared among immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested many people who applied to be advocates for minorities and had no accomplices.
The agency later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the population are supporters or family members of the pro-immigration community, many of whom are immigrants.
So we continue to chase the people", Mr. Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing of the children, the new regulations would require that some of them be brought to court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days, by the current standard, by the housing authorities.
Most would show up by video conference call, rather than personally, to ask for legal notice before an immigration judge.
Those found to be inadequate for examination will be removed immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more they may develop anxiety or nervousness, which may lead to angry expressions or attempts to escape, from the home workers and complaints that appeared in the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said that the ideas were being promoted in buildings such as Tornillo, where the childhood and childhood were more ignored, due to its size.
They added that sending children to the village of the children did not give them enough time to prepare for their mood or to greet their friends could increase the anxiety many of them now have.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil, under the cover of covert surveillance, and that they would be treated fairly.
They must leave immediately without any conditions, he told the congregation.
Moualem stressed that the war on terror has ended in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011, while millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this war until we expel all Syrian fighters for two groups of terrorists and for any illegal foreign presence
The United States has 2,000 troops inside Syria, mostly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arabs forces in the fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 ground troops in the devastated city.
Speaking for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return, and blamed some western countries for the "fear and senselessness" that forced the refugees to stay longer.
We have called out groups and humanitarian organizations to start these repatriations, he said.
They use what should be only human aid issues.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rescue aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the militants to end the fighting.
UN delegates said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone where the last strongest militant group in Idlib had been stationed had opened the door to political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish decision ended a major Syrian-backed Russian military offensive in the region, which has a population of 3 million.
Moualem also stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military damage would drive out jihadists including militants from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who would be eliminated.
UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold the first meetings of the newly formed coalition of government and military forces to draft a constitution to fight Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem laid the groundwork for Syrian government involvement in the organization, saying that the organization's activities should be restricted to the current legal documentation, and warned against involvement.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Round
From that perspective, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as most reasonable minds might expect, impeachment and misconduct ends his term in time.
What can be undisputed The ultimate end of the most terrible president!
Now there are no signs of exhaustion.
Since 2014, the highest-rated broadcast time has risen to 1.05 million times on CNN while it is just short of reaching three times and 1.6 million times on MSNBC.
Fox News has the highest viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million in the past four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show has been at the top of the cable rankings with 3.5 million viewers per night made up of high-profile news.
This is a fire that attracts people to it because it's what we understand, Neal Baer, the ABC's superstar Designated Survivor, was responsible for the cabinet's nomination as president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comic book writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", had another view.
He recalled riding a car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would compare Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are benefits to recreation in the confusion.
Indeed, unlike anything else on TV, the news from Washington would determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, but families who had emigrated could reconnect with the well-being of the world economy.
Distraction is a luxury that only those with money can enjoy.
But for now, it's beyond being a citizen and what happens when you find yourself at 6 o'clock watching panelists arguing about Bob Woodward's use of the deep-rooted head for his book Fear, the cost of the Paul Manafort ostrich leather bomb is $15,000 ( cost of the garment full of hubris, The Washington Post reported) and the outcome of Stormy Daniels's description of Mr. Trump's body is terrible.
I will never see Super Mario again.
Part of what it does that makes it look like a comedy show is that it gives you one thing every night, said Brent Montgomery, chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Pawn Stars, for Trump's show and changing artists and daily news coverage (attacking the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You should avoid any distractions.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees and it was setting on the northern beaches of Kauai, but he was in the room watching MSNBC where he was recording CNN.
He could not help but wonder, not even as Brett Kavanaugh wanted to meet the Legislative Assembly and the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we were doing all those stupid shows in ancient times, people said, This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it meant they were right.

The most difficult midterm election for the House has been eliminated
Not surprisingly, 17th-century Pennsylvania and the Treasury, thanks to the reform of the congressional floor, won two political candidates for the same seat.
The recently renovated Pittsburg suburb seat was held by Rep. Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb and his running mate are also in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which borders the new 17th Congressional District.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old campus was illegally segregated to keep Republicans out.
The new 17th campaign has begun a campaign finance split between the main political funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a minor victory in a special election held in March that was widely watched for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress.
A Republican has held the seat for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a small step forward.
U.S. Expected Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China, But Stopped
Embassies noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had backed Beijing, with little restriction from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was staying at a Panama hotel until the partners fired a Trump Organization executive.
State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for a recent decision to stop supporting Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But consider the penalties for El Salvador alone, which received up to $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development aid and economic support.
The comparable penalties, which included a financial cut and visa restrictions intended to be imposed separately, should be a disaster for the Central American country and its unemployment and homicide rates.
As the indoor meetings continued, North American and Central American workers moved to a high-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up on the same meeting last year that saw progress in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering and visiting the United States.
But before mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, and immediately halted any consideration for sanctions for El Salvador.
The meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, was scheduled for Vice President Mike Pence, with a signal of the administration's importance to the meetings, the delegates said.
The three American missionaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new force or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two delegates, who agreed to discuss the internal dispute in private.
An outside investigator confirmed their report, who was close to the administration and spoke in a confidential setting.
The Education Record
The next step could be a complaint by Robert Mueller's special counsel for the impeachment of Mr Trump, which has clear evidence in public records.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's Russian media have been involved in his campaign against our election.
Congress needs to change hands, and Mr. Trump will find himself questioning that, as he prepares to go again to the electorate, and perhaps later to the judges of his peers.
That's a lot of power, not that I want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall will come - or that of his European allies.
A decision we all make on both sides of the Atlantic will affect the length of the conflict.
In 1938, German workers were ready to take over from Hitler, if the West prevented it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to escape the year of the great destruction.
The history of the revolution, the unending struggle for democracy, will continue or be delayed.
Americans are now facing many major changes.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in serious trouble since the publication of that report, and last year he compared secretly recording a president and accused it of being bad for the company.
Mr. Rosentein misrepresented the story of The Times.
How would we respond if the new FBI investigation of a request for Brett Kavanaugh was not thorough or valid - or if it was submitted to the Supreme Court despite clear allegations of rape and unfounded evidence?
First of all, will we hold a mid-year election for Congress to fill Mr. Trump's seat?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be ready for a long period of stagnation.
But I was convinced that we would not fail, given what we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported from Auschwitz when the Nazi authorities occupied my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to a Sabbath candle lit on the swastika table.
Or that's my culture, how can I have real hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers has high hopes for the Rapid Vienna competition
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, followed by a friendly against the beautiful Spanish midfielder Villareal earlier this month, would put them in a difficult position to finish out in the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first round of the competition until the 2-2 draw between Villareal but he believed the Rangers could use the result as a step to make a spectacular impact.
"It's a good sign for us because Villareal is a good side", the 31-year-old said.
We entered the game hoping we could get something and come out with a score.
Maybe we should have a win in the final but, in sum, the winner is the winner.
They seemed better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were better.
Thursday's entrance was another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but, with the crowd with us, I am ready that we can go ahead and get a good result.
The last year was a tough one, despite all the things that happened to me and the changes in the competition itself but there is a positive spirit about the place now.
The team was good, my boys had their vision; training was good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, put a year of competition behind us and do well.
Women and the mob out of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how much they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
About half of those in a Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to negotiate the plan, Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life saving business, said.
Here is where you should start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot provide for the family if you do not communicate your needs in time.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as the choices may be important factors in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: A financial advisor may also help you to suggest ways to pay for the expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include existing long-term care insurance policies, mutual benefit life insurance policies to help you cover these budgets or personal insurance by using your own assets - whether you have the funds.
Discuss your legal document: Settle legal issues on the spot.
Keep a healthcare label and be prepared so that you can entrust it to a trusted person to take care of your health care and ensure that professionals meet your interests if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the legal authority of a lawyer for your money.
You will have to hire a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your expenses are paid if you are unable to afford them.
Keep this in mind: Imagine that your more experienced parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer for medicines and their precautions?
Express these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It's not just about money, but who are his doctors? Martin asks.
What is the effect of the drugs?
Who will look after the dog?
Make the plan".

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a major earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As the communication channel was blocked, relief workers could not get any information from the Donggala governorate, northern region of Palu near the center of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were displaced after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi Islands:
Palou is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the strait on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a 300-km (180-mile) long administrative region of the western and northern part of Sulawesi.
The administrative county, the administrative region under the park, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi, especially the watershed region of Donggala.
Nickel production was also important in the camp, but more so in Morowali, and Sulawesi's frontal defences.
Tsunami has struck Palu and Dongalla several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is further in the Pacific Ring of Fire, with regular earthquakes and natural resources.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western shore of the Aceh Indonesian peninsula off Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 cities, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A major earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami on the southern coast, killing up to 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake hit Mentawai Island, off Sumatra, and a 10-meter-high tsunami devastated many rural areas, killing up to 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and unrest and remembrance of the damage caused by the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami was sparked at this time, but the houses and the collapses killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern coast of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of homes and left some passengers with little trouble.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Rape
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, involvement in a protest of violence and prevention of detention, according to a complaint filed by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
From the police complaint, when a girlfriend tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone out of her hand.
Palin was arrested in Mat-Su Pre-Trial Building, held on a $500 bond and without security, which KTUU issued.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself innocent, indeed, when his request was denied, the network frowned upon.
Palin is charged with Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to a year in prison or fined $250,000.
He has been charged with a Class B crime, and could face a day in jail or a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first criminal charge against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case was before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with assault, involvement in criminal assault, and use of a weapon of mass destruction and alcohol in connection with the case.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Veteran reported Sarah Palin in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD beginning her career in Iraq.
Indonesia: Tsunami earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity grids and communications were damaged, with the dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a small outskirts of central Sulawesi, which is the eastern and northern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the public transit system show the time.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu after a tsunami hit the beach.
Federal judges seeking the death penalty for suspected terror attack in NYC
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - the most unprecedented penalty in the state for any federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with operating a Home Depot truck and causing the accident on the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To prove the justification for the death penalty, the judges would show that Saipov deliberately killed eight people and deliberately injured the vast majority, by a series of attempts to seek the death penalty, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, according to the court's filing.
A week after the attack, a federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts including eight counts of murder during the winter months, which federal prosecutors often used in criminal cases, as well as charges of assault and car damage.
The attack required a thorough planning and deliberation, the judges said, and described the actions of Saipov to make it more brutal, vicious and polluting.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, torture, and destruction to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the resolution said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York had a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of two murders and drug trafficking but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time capital punishment was imposed in a New York city court case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiring to commit treason for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed in a electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed ruthlessness in the days and months following the attack, as evidenced by court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with his actions, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that his motivation for the attack was to watch ISIS videos on his phone, which the charges showed.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag inside his hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the city's central public advocates on behalf of Saipov, expressed deep regret for the decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole will further increase the fears of the events for all those affected", Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked the judges to stop seeking the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put on the top of the Brexit bell
Nigel Farage pledged to rally the army of the mob today during a protest in the Tory congregation.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should get warmth from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs compared her to the head of the EU's central bank.
Conservative backbench chairman Peter Bone told crowds in Birmingham in the UK would rise if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's argument was that the reunification of her divided party was a mistake as Conservative supporters joined a protest against Brexit in the country.
The leader is reluctant to keep his Chequers deal plan in order between the attacks by the Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the slander - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and the "excuses".
Mr Bone told a Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to drop Chequers.
He compared that Mr. Farage should be made a member and given the job of conductor in central Brussels.
"If he is in charge, we should go now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: I will stand up for Brexit but we should get rid of Chequers.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: We have not fought a world war to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Boone lost the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: Alo and the British have changed their minds and want to remain false and soap.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the conference, telling reporters: Just what I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Many people don't like Chequers, the Opposition doesn't like it, our political parties and activists don't like it, who walk the streets and see us elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.
In Mrs May's message, she said: Prime ministers leave their posts when they make their promises.
Mr Farage told the assembly that the politicians should get the heat if they want to escape the decision made in the 2016 election.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and one of our political parties", he said.
They are trying to escape Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not leave you if you do that.
A message for the increasingly motivated crowd included: We want you to show our political group, which is on the verge of breaking Brexit, the heat.
We joined forces with the country's population forces that gave us victory in Brexit, we will not rest until we are also an independent, self-governing, and elevated United Kingdom.
On the other hand, the Remainers left Birmingham before the convention and spent two hours in the city hall.
A small rally of Tory and Brexit-flagged activists had just started this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis reported to the Conservatives about the security problems they had suffered by using a party tool to open the meeting.
There are people who tell us that they have a ready IT system with all the technology for Canada plus plus, for land and no problems, for zero and no land business in Ireland, he added.
It was a big hatred.
There is nothing like a real Brexit, he added.
Warren is strongly supporting the candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a meeting room in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November facing Rep. Geoff Diehl of the state GOP, who was Trump's chief campaign coordinator in 2016 in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of a campaign to push Trump out in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was the 36th gathering of the community using the hall system since Trump took office.
The man asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, but that included a woman at the head.
Don't be fooled by the LSU Sims scam
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday that one person has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They uploaded a video of the gunshot on Friday, asking for help and identifying a man seen in the photo.
Sims was shot and killed by 20 gunmen near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, and died as a result, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, he believed he was there, with a gun, and agreed to shoot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
June 6-foot-6 grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of reaching the international cup as a one-man race gives him a win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday by a Mercedes team that would have a major impact on the race.
Initially, Bottas got off to a good start, a little to leave Hamilton in the sand to defend his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to sleep with his team-mate.
Vettel entered the pit first and let Hamilton into the lock and key at the end of the group, the decision should have been made.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a foot-to-foot injury so the Ferrari driver was reluctant to allow the pit to open due to fear of straining after being pushed to make a move in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen started the series in the back, placing seventh in the final of his first lap on his 21st birthday.
He continued to be ahead for several hours as he grabbed his tire to drive the fastest finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He finally entered the pit on lap 44 but was unable to raise his speed on lap eight remaining for Raikkonen to take fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all week and was a gentle man as I was told.
The team has done a special job to have the first and second, Hamilton said.
That Was the Most Mischievous Language
President Donald Trump told Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her affirmation that she had not disclosed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice accused of assaulting a woman.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, but said that the events in the House showed that people were cruel and treacherous.
"One thing that can happen and a wonderful thing happens a few days ago in the Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and angry, angry and deceitful", he said.
When you saw the opening and the opening they said oh, I didn't.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you opened up?
Remember the answer... you opened the book - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not open up".
Well, wait a minute.
We have previously...No, we have not disclosed, he added, the opposition of the prosecutor.
Feinstein received a letter describing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh last July, but it was unsealed in early September - but Feinstein denied the disclosure came from his company.
"I have not charged Dr. Ford, his story has not been disclosed", Feinstein told the congregation, The Hill reported.
He asked me to arrest him in secret, and I kept him secret, as he asked.
But the denial was not good for the president, who spoke on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, this is the bad language.
Maybe not, but that was the worst language I've ever seen.
The president's continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee, one of three women accused of assault, compared the Democrats to using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to restore energy by any means possible.
You see the heartbreak, the cruelty, they don't care who they are torturing, who they will turn to to get power and control, Mediaite said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in their Dundee game
Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the relegation play-off 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals in the first half by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie batted back to put the guys in a home game before Dwyer restored the Giants' life.
Francois Bouchard returned for Dundee before the two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won their first.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the year for Adam Keefe's back-to-back teams and they won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the year between the two teams, as the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth quarter at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull's help, while David Rutherford brought in the lead as Beauvillier extended the lead four minutes later.
In a developmental era filled with corruption, Sullivan brought the team back to the gym at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was an assistant for Cownie's response at 15:16.
Dwyer saw the Giants take the lead into the first half when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side recovered and Bouchard again added them to the group stage with a big goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen give Dundee the lead in the competition at the end of the second period, and he closed the win with his team's fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who had lost four of their last five races, were at home in Milton Keynes for their next race on Friday.
A Pilot Died to See Hundreds of People On An Airplane Fleeing From An Earthquake
An Indonesian aviation expert is hailed as a hero after his death as the plane carrying hundreds of people flew safely.
More than 800 people died, most of them empty, after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A massive earthquake continued to affect the area, mostly trapped under grass in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawang Agung has resigned from his position on the control room and power station of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He insisted on ensuring that the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the road to take off, was more efficient and safe.
Then he jumped from the control room when he thought he was about to fall.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision had the potential to save many lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a hospital for cargo to another city.
Sadly, he left us this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were heartbroken to hear about this", he added.
On the other hand, licensees fear that the death toll will reach thousands of people as the city's disaster prevention agency is talking about how to get to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong locked up.
It is believed that the number is still rising where most people are still under threat where they have not yet had access to the majority, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a company spokesman.
A storm of up to six metres has devastated Palu, causing severe flooding on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
It's cold in the little markets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the living but we don't know what they will find there.
This has been a disaster, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the local military: I urge all of you to work day and night to complete any work related to the bombing.
Are you ready?  CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Indonesia and Lombok that killed 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini killed a man in a plane crash near the river
Air traffic controllers in the Pacific coastal waters of Micronesia now say one man is empty, after initially saying that all 47 passengers and crew on board the aircraft have been evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, that it had not been able to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details for the passenger, such as age or country.
A small local boat helped save passengers and other crew as the plane sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and that they were all in good condition.
The exact cause of the accident and the schedule of the event are unclear.
The plane and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the River Thames just before it hit the road.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the road.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane had a short landing.
That's a great thing, Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others tried to cross the waterline and reached the emergency exit on the plane in a hurry.
He said that the flight crew were terrified and screaming, and that he had a minor head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that nearby shipowners and pilots were working to improve the harbor and helped to rescue by using a shallow boat and transporting people to the ground before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people died in crashes of aircraft registered with PNG in the last two decades but not including Air Niugini.
Researchers have shown the time of night when a woman's life is turned upside down
The jury dismissed his trial on Saturday on appeal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Investigator Paul Rowlett has long testified as an expert witness in the field of intelligence research.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the accused 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she had obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, in contradiction to her last words, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed Chambers had used his phone while reporting to his friend Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford.
Sanford took the seat on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the judges questioned whether Tellis was correct when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was late, because I was in Nashville.
In addition, Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks after his death.
Phone records show that they have known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life", Hale said.
The defenders are scheduled to begin their final campaign on Sunday.
The chief justice said he expected the case to go to a panel later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop intelligence?
Three hip hop artists wanted to change the negative outlook for the genre by filling their music with beautiful messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has abandoned its original political message and is talking about social issues.
They wanted to go back to its roots and make hip hop smart build popularity again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK from bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nursing home applicant for a job for a high-quality certificate
A New York nursing home is suing a couple for racial discrimination after receiving a letter from her mother complaining that she is another black woman.
The couple denied that they were overprotective, saying the case was a financial fraud.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anger when she discovered that her baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman arriving on her first day of work in 2016.
Another letter from the C.E.O.,  Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
Instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice two times.
After discovering her guilt, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the kidnapper, an African-American, had committed a crime against her and was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice paid for a day's work and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is filing for the couple's compensation for the murder, requiring a $350 daily allowance for six months, the housing arrangement that had previously employed him, but without a written agreement.
I want to show them, look, you can't do that, he told the Post on Friday, and put I know it's prejudice.
The couple have denied the allegations of being too much, saying that it was the right thing to do to quit Maurice's job, and fearing that they could not trust him after they had angered him.
My wife sent him a message that he didn't mean.
He was a very big man.
We are not the first, her husband Joel Plasco told Post.
But will you entrust your children to someone against whom you have spoken badly, even if he is sinning?
Your baby?
Come along.
Comparing the case to money laundering, Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago, and he was in a difficult situation.
WOULD you drive such a person away?
That's not necessarily the right thing to do, the bank's investment banker added.
The trial is still ongoing, and the court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in public, criticizing their conduct and opinions.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not understand beer and speech, a new letter showed
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who studied immediately after receiving the book, said of the letter: It is difficult to put yourself in the position of a first-time reader before it is published.
It's a great laugh now and you know the great good news of Paddington.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he was inspired to write the children's book for a small beer toy, would have good hopes that his work would be rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was celebrated after his death last year.
Paddington, who described the family as "a very important member", also said that his father was proud of his progress.
He was a gentle man, not a proud man, he said.
But because Paddington lives a long life for him, it's like having a baby accomplished something: you'll feel proud when they're there even if it's not your strength.
I think he saw Paddington's progress that way.
Although it was his production and his mind, he always praised Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying, only on the phone can I make her feel
In the fall his daughter had been taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad was calling every now and then to say that he was very ill, and did not expect to survive, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die within two minutes, I should have told her so.
I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you, I feel it.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors gave him medication to keep his soul from slowly exfoliating and leaving his body.
He had died before that, and this was all a waste.
I went further and waited, knowing that everything was going wrong.
I could not weep or cry or cry because I was in the shoes of family and people around me.
I had to pack myself up.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, flew along with other passengers - who were unaware of what she was passing through.
"No one knows", he said.
I nodded my head, and my daughter was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt the deepest sadness for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Women mourn and hold cards to prevent the rain
Two women who were roped to take their loved ones and work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys had a postcard with messages that excited the mood and phone numbers since the Welsh flood that people could call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he developed depression and committed suicide at age 18.
He said I don't want any other parent to feel the way I do every day,.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a cook and a bright, smiling future-minded man.
He was known for his laughter.
They always talk about her smile and lift up every room.
However, he quit work before he died, because he was in a very bad situation.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who saw his brother commit suicide.
Ms Davis said: I always thought there would be a similar feeling.
Ms. Davis made the cards, to let people know that there are people here they can approach and talk to, even if it's a friend.
And do not be silent - you should speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He said he didn't say he was humble or discouraged or anything.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the ground on Christmas Day - when children opened their eyes to the gifts they had not received or anything.
He said his death was a big shock to them, but they would work together to overcome it: He broke a hole in the family.
It divides us.
But we will all continue to fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the air as the FBI begins its investigation
"I think if we can get what he's asking for - timely, male-limited research - we can bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the congregation and the transition to democracy in the face of a political lockdown.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of interest was due to time.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will not have much power in their bid to win the man they want to be nominated to the lower court.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Congress, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What would happen if the FBI released his report?
Elections will be held in the Legislative Assembly, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in the chamber.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could win at least 50 elections to the Legislative Assembly, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to call his vote and submit it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seun, referring to data from the South Connection Minutes, said there had been 1,127 escapes last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said land management has increased ties between North Korea and China and high transportation costs are among the causes.
Pyongyang has not yet made a public statement.
Many of the North Korean refugees were granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most were fired from China, which has the longest land border between North Korea and is still easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the refugees fleeing as the refugees are weaker than the refugees and bring them back in anger.
Relations between North and South - which are still at war - have been dramatically improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries saw Pyongyang for more discussions on the nuclear weapons disarmament pipeline.
This came as a major June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a broad topic to work together for the Korean peninsula and nuclear non-proliferation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the progress that has not been made since.
With no confidence in the US, no faith in our national security and in such circumstances, there is no way we can be a consensus on how to simultaneously spread our weapons, Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", saying he was not old enough to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nominee  crazy and said it takes a lot of rage to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did such a thing, they would say she was crazy", Pelosi said of her impact in Kavanaugh's testimony before the National Judicial Conference on Thursday.
Kavanaugh bitterly denied the allegations that he raped Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his developmental speech, Kavanaugh's mood was so high, he sometimes nearly screamed and was struck by this voice as he talked about his family and his college years.
He also spoke out against the Democrats in the House, calling for a "terrible, outrageous" campaign of the Democrats and angered that Hillary Clinton failed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed she could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed her dislike of Democrats.
He said I think he was self-deprecating by using those words and the way he slandered the Clintons and the Democrats,
Pelosi calmed down when asked if she would remove Kavanaugh if she was elected, if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then not only is he not old enough to be in the Supreme Court, but you are in the court he is now in", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh was chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that while a Democrat is concerned about Kavanaugh's re-election, there will be the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is seen as a joke and a barrier to change.
Before he sat down, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a crazy, crazy person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not right,'" Pelosi said.
It Is for Women to Use.
He was a rightful critic, a month and a year of rage and frustration, and he could not say that he had not cried.
"We were crying in the shower when we were angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is new, do you think?
He continued, I got a lot of help from a woman who was a president at one place, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she learned the way to mean when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I was angry.
Then he will move on.
I thought that was pretty cool.
Tears are accepted as an excuse for anger in part because of their clear understanding.
One of my most memorable memories was my early career, when a men's company passed, and I found myself in a rage and rage, when an old woman - a frightened manager - dragged me behind my door and dragged me to the stairs.
"Let them see you in the bed", he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, ran for president for Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair with another woman aboard a ship called Monkey Business, he left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, furiously discovering that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
It was not a thoughtful idea, he told me 30 years later.
There are seven other candidates in the race, and they don't need another candidate.
One called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because he was late for the campaign, he was behind in raising money, so he vowed not to enter the race unless he won $2 million.
It is a battle to be won.
He found that some of his supporters gave the men $1000 and gave him only $250.
Do you think I can get a discount? he considered.
When he said he would not fully launch a campaign, he was overwhelmed by a sense of optimism - thanks to the support of the people, anger and systematically making it very difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than representatives, and anger and sexism - he was deeply moved.
"You may think I was very frightened", Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the journalists discovered her.
YOU may think that Kleenex is a company that supports me.
I remember thinking, 'What will be put on the stone in my tomb?'
Did he cry?
How a US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial outbreak of the trade war between the US and China was a cover-up, and as the fighting was long and winding down, the division between the countries could lead to Beijing's future, experts said.
Donald Trump, US President, first warned earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese export markets including panel steel, steel and aluminum.
The most significant stimulus this week was a new tax that affected a total of $200 billion (£150 billion) in stock prices, and included taxes on half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has repeatedly done the same, recently imposing a 5 to 10 percent tax on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to embrace the US with every ounce of corruption, and the world's second-largest economy cannot be looked at any time soon.
To dislodge Washington means to agree to the demands, but to publicly denounce the US would be a great shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still insist that if Beijing plays its cards well, the US trade war may further support China by reducing the bilateral trade deficit.
The rapid political decision-making scandal in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that could trigger economic turmoil in the same two cities that remains more dangerous than previously agreed by analysts, said Abigail Grace, a researcher with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security, advisors.
Syria's support for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was supportive of the return of the refugees themselves, asking for help and rebuilding the city that had been devastated by more than seven years of fighting.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the city was improving.
He said the ground conditions are still safe and secure, thanks to progress made and the prevention of the entry of the inhabitants.
The government continued to repair the damaged areas to restore the original condition.
All the current conditions for the return of refugees to their homelands are left by the displaced and the economic values of the group are designed to accommodate their lives and their work.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the conflict in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the city and need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept aid and rebuild the damaged city.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept any help from the situation or from the states that supported the riots.
Europe holds the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16:5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost three European Championships, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown as one of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points against the United States.
US legend Phil Mickelson, who had many problems in the tournament, pitched his ball into the water with a 3-hit for the 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had a successful career, being the first 1-for-4 player to go 5-0-0 since the current tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America lost 5-4 to the most famous European player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who had qualified for his last Ryder Cup.
Former Ryder Cup winner, Spanish Sergio Garcia was the most successful European player in the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
 I don't usually sleep, but today I can't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for appointing me and for agreeing with me.
I was so happy and delighted to have the cup again.
It's for the team. I'm glad I can help, which Garcia was so excited to say about the European victory.
He handed the trophy to fellow countryman John Ram who beat US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"My pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up", said Rahm, 23.
Wood lost all four of his championships in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 of the Ryder Cup championship.
The number and wonder of one of the greatest players of all time, has won 14 Grand Slam titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a way past except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had scored the highest number of goals in the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a game that was bad for his team, "I have a lot of pride in these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were cooking Europeans.
We failed.
Thanks to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 musicians performed well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Conference, we'll move on.
I loved these 12 boys, and I was proud to serve as captain.
You will bow down.
We did well.
