Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feather coat was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a spool, but have other features of feathers  rays and beams , the researchers concluded that the spool was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display.
The researchers reasoned that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not young dune.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Using brightness and rotation, the star's ross exchange rate is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the ross number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces resembling tidal waters in the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravity on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
"In an interview, he said that the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate"."
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6 000 out of a total of 330 000 people were infected at any given time in South Africa.

"They are cooler than the surrounding surface by day and warmer by night".
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a paper crate with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the voter's identity has been verified by officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot papers have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the electorate.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process, and at night the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and follow specific procedures.

Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may be rendered useless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects"."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document leak is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is asking for 10 years of permanent military presence in the valley after an agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park keepers as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly sworn in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth election to the Provisional Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former interim election council resign, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it had 27 known accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""silly"".
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable"".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Rescue Service said there were no reports of damage in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she needed a bathroom visit.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if given a hormone, the fetus' lung maturation would accelerate.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators had stashed two "black boxes" during Wednesday".
Fellow wrestlers also praised Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, Luna died on the night of the two moons, pretty unique just like her, strong woman, and I'm not sure what to do with her".
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was a freak as big as I am... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's better off where she is now"."
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last remaining monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swum the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his trouble, there have been doubts about his condition.
He hasn't been able to take the medication needed to overcome his pain since it's banned from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the earth's water resources, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and trams".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the plane flies shorter distances, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduces carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being introduced, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available on the ground level.
Fears of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer because of breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Spanish finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled into thin thread that can be twisted and braided, or hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""illuminated manuscripts"".
This is called the pH of a chemical.
The juice from the cabbage changes in hue depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogens are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common room.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that the wheel has done is give us a much simpler and faster mode of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
Females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
LeJob acts much like herds of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can ride.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of murmuring, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find food by smell, by sniffing the ground where they are.
They can see very well in the dark with their dark vision and they can also move very stealthily, and they hunt their prey by fusing into their environment and then jumping over the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one in which it was previously found.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous peoples have not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce food by photosynthesizing sunlight, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, a lot of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were possessed of more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the jaw, which meant that there was no chance of escape from anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual food items, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the hazelnut.
Another difference was that while the poor men and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was only accessible to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurat, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were open countertops facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Even though each country was ""Scandinavian"" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, up and down".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was run by the "Vichy" French, these were French people who had made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture means the transfer of knowledge between generations, a long cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it fell to the often uncooperative state governments to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the Länder before they could be added, and the Länder attached so little weight to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the world's second most successful team, and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often counted as an archipelago in geographical terms.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the original grain production and employed Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which gave sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image ratio is inherited from the format of the photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) correspond to or are close to this ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best position for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being investigated.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted underwater warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most of the inhabitants and countries.
After witnessing the horrors of war and the atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to begin work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of separating different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history, or each family that was in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jind dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest chair in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all aspiring men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to make a success of themselves.
The same is true of the military, where rank in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to make revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the ""Noor"" mountain (light) to meditate".
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it's there, because inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great sphinx".
The Cheops pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The marking for ""up-stripe"" looks like a V and the marking for ""down-stripe"" looks like a clasp or a square without a bottom".
Up means you should start at the tip and push the straw up, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the straw) and pull the straw down.
An upbeat usually generates a softer sound, while a downbeat is louder and more resolute.
You may draw your own markings, but remember that the printed bar markings are there for a musical purpose, so they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open at the gavel.
On one occasion, one of the mob members nodded to an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the fundamental profits of American imperialism.
To understand the temple masters, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the idea that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that relates to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that the motor-driven car inevitably leads to the building of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass-driving cars also lead to higher rates of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its influence declined during the 14th century mainly because of the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th and 12th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, the Western styles could drag on for 25 to 30 years.
And towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustained farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with rotation farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Some wild children have been incarcerated by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the specific pet, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, supporting learning goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it's also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the learner to cope with on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing or educational, but it does happen.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster homes exist to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home they came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Even ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks in his essay ""The President's Speech"" showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection takes it out of the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination push variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Moreover, the lack of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and bark, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also offers high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today".
Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you normally turn off your watch when you sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known fluid thinner) before bed, which causes you to have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in the Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Godsyogan is central to Tibetan meditation, and through visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, while violating the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish nonaggression pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them for milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgets were usually kept in huts that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often felled by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more famous shepherd.
Carriage tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways were only parallel wooden planks, the horses pulling them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the more rugged roads of the day.
Slippers were introduced early enough to hold the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a practice, but the iron was more on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron railings were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is often symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survives today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with shells and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity is not always immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of poisoning could be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bug" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient relatives of bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both beetles and ticks are resident, adapted to live in the host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and spinal cord.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is the guiding principle in almost all research.
Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that either marked the DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to work, and others pass by whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive collectivity has upset the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developing countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the processing cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Well, motorists tend to behave in a decent manner; thus, traffic tends to flow in a fairly consistent manner and can be presented mathematically in broad strokes.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to drop their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot drop their wings are the witch-eyed and the day-eyed.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, for it does not feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second-longest river, with a water flow more than eight times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
The Amazon is the source of 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 kilometers long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed in size and construction technology.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, since these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
So, elements like calcium and potassium are metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has become less important and less useful.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, never having to get near a pen-washer.
You can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so it doesn't take much to break them down.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on the right side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon's horizon and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories hold that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment is that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members, as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by local management.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The "Invisible Team" is the management team to which all members report.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus making the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior is supporting researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and also handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, technology and the military, and has been incorporated into several home computer and TV game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of every classroom, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions through virtual study visits, where students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions may remain online as a clipping book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world.The requirement to cater to readers' interest stimulates students to be picky and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as present their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of galleries and museums that show Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the beautiful, unspoiled countryside of Musco.
All of this and more marks Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are close enough to uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama circumnavigated the Cape of Good Hope and thereby found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to wear a ring too (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up to them (cultural differences don't do it).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of creamy things, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you're going to visit outside of Goma, you should check out the situation with the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma, the normal (local) price for the short trip being about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the major stops on the Henry Louis Gates PBS show Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as their main focus.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering stack diagram that is enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront opposite Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's settlement is clustered on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been accepted into the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are not just mangrove remnants  they contain some of the last remaining sites of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges basin.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 elk in the area.
Buses depart from the district bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], are 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and have two aisles that are 12 feet [3.50 m] wide.
The vertical free-standing height of the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chacor region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the ""Giant Province of India"", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous peoples".
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having a polo team and players that are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted throughout the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and USD are often acceptable.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
No matter how vulnerable they may appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep the camp clean.
Samoa's capital, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most the Maori myrtle offers shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore.
"The main local beer is ""Number one"", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for the journey.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
"To Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unknown. A ""short black"" is an ""espresso"", a cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk is Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Kubmanets occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveller security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package trips that combine flights and hotels.
They can also book your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are going, you have to get there early to get a campground close to the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have ceased, parts of the festival may continue to play music into the late night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because going through ice makes a really terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city.
Casinos usually do their best to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible, often without windows or clocks, and often with difficult exits.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice and sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snow acids or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted year round.
Safari is perhaps the largest tourist industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to travels across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and can be seen with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars.
"Walking safaris (also called ""bush walk"" and ""hiking safaris") consist of hiking either for a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021 with some events being held at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, since it hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus are different, but at the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed even if they are not in the room.
If no ironing iron is available, or if you do not want to wear curly socks, you may try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, sweating).
There are different ways to clean water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you're unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poisons or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans violently, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes or other surcharges in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road, which often passes through isolated primeval forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the road, drive wisely: steep inclines, narrow lanes and twisting curves are common.
The speed limits imposed are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and their observance is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked in pastries year-round and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want small but powerful pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan often use yogurt in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that includes a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
However, when used without adjectives, the term tends to mean food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the kingdom, offers a wealth of easily seasoned dishes, with the flavorings most used by Javanese being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The footrests are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose a safety risk as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but has caught his foot in the tread, he can be pulled if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a saddle handle will detach from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes through the countless mountain walls.
Outdoor activities, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to one's feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski lovers", who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date as far back as 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norsemen in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, turkey skiing or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover a slightly longer distance than on foot  but you will rarely reach speed like in cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls on several occasions.
The Schengen area, however, functions more or less as a country in this respect.

Courier companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly, and time is often crucial when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent goods by air, it may have taken several days on some routes to clear unloading and customs.

By the same logic, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This one can also be borrowed from the entrance storage but those clothes are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
