Welsh AMs worried about 'how to look like fools'
There is concern among some AMs over the decision to change their status to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Assembly).
The controversy was sparked by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Assembly.
THE political parties are very concerned about the risk of corruption.
A Labour MP said the group was concerned "it was causing trouble for the Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means madness and pwp means bone.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said the group had "nothing in mind" about changing the name, but noted it was a slight change from MWP to the Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The House committee, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name change, said: The final ruling on any disclosure of what members of the House are called will be a matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had received the most support for convening the Welsh Assembly.
On the issue of the name of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the choice of MWP received more support in a public debate.
The AMs are clearly suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a resolution could prove difficult for the Acting Chair, Elin Jones, who is expected to override the bill on changes in weeks.
The bill on the changes will include other changes to the way the House works, including rules on declaring ineligible AMs and laying down the structure of the committee.
The AMs will have the final say on what they are called when they debate the bill.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was a prelude to a year-long dispute with Greece's neighboring province of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a threat to its territory and has repeatedly rejected its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of direct elections on the name change, said he would withdraw from the elections.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO Alliance.
St. Martin's Bell is silenced because the Synagogues in Harlem are in a state of Emergency
Historically, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a chapel on every corner, Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none.
He said that the drunkard's confusion is a matter of perception.
People are entertaining in a different way these days, it's a machine.
The pubs are no longer the adjoining rooms where people come and go.
In the case of the synagogues, he was concerned that the money from the sale of property would not be delayed if as the leaders expected, and sooner or later would return if they started.
He added that the churches and apartment buildings will be replaced with large squares full of people who will not be able to help other shelters for refugees.
"The majority of people who would buy high-rise buildings in these buildings would be white", he said, "and therefore they would rush to the day when these churches would be declared completely closed because it is likely that most of these people who moved into these high-rise buildings would be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black community - the First City in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The origin of white Methodist congregations goes back to the 1930s.
A group of black worshippers who worshiped nearby took possession of the building.
The St. Martins movement was led by black devotees under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led the business community to avoid buying goods on Line 125, a major shopping street in Harlem, which was committed to hiring or supporting black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's followers made plans to rebuild, they reopened the church's music hall.
Rabbi David Johnson, the son of Fr Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the church's instruments "the blackest of the common folk".
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else: A treasure trove of culture and An irreplaceable artifact.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first instrument in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had played the organ at the Riverside Hall 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not changed him.
What appeared at St. Martin's a few months ago was a confusing story of artists and contractors, some brought on by uneducated church leaders, others by the authority of the Episcopal bishop.
Then the vestry committee - the governing body of the parish, which included the lay leaders - wrote to the bishop in July with their concerns that the parish would seek to transfer the expenses to the vestry committee, even though the vestry committee was not hiring the artists contracted by the parish.
Some members complained about the lack of clarity about what was happening on the other side of the synagogue's boundary.
A 13-year-old lobster hunter in California is injured by a whale
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a large shark on Saturday while hunting for losbter in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Black Sea Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming and then he went there with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a lizard catching a loser, but then he realized that he was yelling, I've been bitten!
I was bitten!
His shoulder was completely open, Hammel said, and he saw it when he reached the boy.
I shouted at everyone to get out of the water. Hammel added, There is a big fish in the water!
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of the giant squid that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the Lifeboat said in a press conference that a giant squid was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not from any other species and was a dangerous giant squid.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his back.
Officers closed the access to the beach from Black Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and protection purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of large sharks in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is preparing to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's carries Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with the same fashion department stores that employ its staff and professional assistants.
As part of the £2.8 billion British fashion market, which continues to grow despite a decline in the fashion and home goods trade, major fashion pieces will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and taken to more stores next year if the trend is successful.
Investments in fashion are coming as supermarkets are scrambling to use the previously empty spaces to store food, cooking appliances and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its packaging volume to nearly 3,000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have regional substitutes of the same brands as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its range of modern products to make most of its products vegan - something that is increasingly in demand by retailers.
In addition, the perfume brand Perfume Shop will test offering discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards buying a small amount of food each day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets must do more to attract more visitors.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said the side shops will continue to resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos side stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since it bought the entire chain two years ago, which it says has further improved the retail experience of the grocery chain and made it more profitable.
Efforts by the supermarket to recover the plastic parts and the pharmaceutical products have been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a business partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger came to an end after a dispute over how to allocate revenue from pharmacies within its own supermarket chain.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy stores business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
He said Llyods would play another role in the scheme, by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products that included La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales director of Sainsbury's said: We changed the look and feel of the cosmetic sector to improve the experience for our customers.
We also invested in our specially trained colleagues who would be nearby to provide advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit every need and the elegant and accessible environment means a destination of attractive beauty that challenges the old way of buying goods.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has gone on a 'hiatus' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked out of her £11 million contract and her business lifestyle to move on to her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for their household goods and Truly's supporting cast.
Their commercials were linked to the popularity of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, took to Instagram where she announced her departure.
Holly Willoughby leaves the Dragons" star Den Peter Jones angrily says she's out of their lucrative business model at the end of the season - to face her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
The media said Jones was "furious" when the TV personality confirmed during a rousing interview on Tuesday at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she now had no time to waste on their home goods and Truly's promotional products.
The deal was tied to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have drawn the net worth of Willoughby's estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and passed one of his vacation homes.
One source says: Truly is at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be a long-term camp that would last for some years to come.
Her decision to expel me left everyone in the room in a state of shock.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the inauguration.
There is a large warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most widely circulated stars, will cost the company millions due to excessive investment in products from pillows to candles to clothing and furniture, and the possible delay of its launch.
And he would give the last meaning of a long-time friend.
Mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The couple often vacationed together and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night We will not comment on his business dealings.
The main point is that we started dating.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unfitting of a president" and that he had a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in his speech that he was disappointed by the news.
I left everything.
He noted that Kim was keen on a second round of talks after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards denuclearisation in North Korea.
But the nuclear arms treaties have failed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen a similar push from the United States towards a North Korean-initiated disarmament effort.
In a statement, he noted, the US maintains sanctions with the intention of continuing pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
"Everything is going well with North Korea", he said.
We would start a war with North Korea.
Millions of lives would have been lost.
And now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - bringing to an end the missile tests, facilitating the release of hostages and securing the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his way to a brand in his speeches and interactions with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this bullshit, we're going to have about 200 people in here", Trump said, pointing his finger directly at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island, Hundreds are Killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok lost their homes, no national emergency was declared, a condition that would require international assistance.
In many instances, unfortunately, they have clearly not sought international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge, Ms Sumbung said.
When Save the Children was organising an expedition to Palu, it was not sure if foreign workers would be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the international relief agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international representatives would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Faced with the earthquakes that Indonesia is used to, the country has become seriously unprepared for the disaster.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they were not visible in the coastal areas.
The failure of a tsunami warning to go public in Palu, despite a tsunami warning being in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, communication between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
God-sent plagues make the distribution of necessities very difficult.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok was on its way to Palu to treat the earthquake victims, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the rehabilitation of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But the lack of sufficient funds plagued Mr Joko's government as he faced re-election the following year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from the rise of religious separatism and anti-colonialism, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more radical form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim militants battled in the streets, using clubs, bows, and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has drawn with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a challenging Premier League cup game where he lost to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a free kick from Xherdan Shaqiri almost 30 minutes away from Chelsea with his team trailing 1-0.
He hits the ball to his left before hitting another ball to the far post.
The effort lifted the box above where it descended to the top right corner of the ram.
The ball finally landed on top of Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump where it also landed in the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com that "It was just another attempt to get in this place, to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to create for myself as much time as possible".
 I saw Kante coming and he touched once and I didn't think much about it so I just punched.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after they had scored another goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before running to midfield and scoring in Liverpool's half.
Suddenly you Kovacic made a move and ran into the center of the field.
Then he made another good shot, where he pushed Hazard into the box.
Hazard passed the goalkeepers and finished into the far-field goal with a quick left foot shot that he passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool battled Napoli in the group stage of the Challenge League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League Challenge Cup at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll has increased to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said earlier on Sunday.
It left hundreds of people in the rubble of buildings and ruins after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a tsunami wave that lasted 20 years, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was plagued by a series of broken bridges.
Police arrested man, 32 years old on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman
An investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews in St John's, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have searched the area for anyone who has seen or heard anything that might alert them.
Inspector Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the very early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone around John's Line in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything that they do not believe has contacted us.
I would again call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a picture with the front camera to contact us as they may have information that is relevant to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found dead was from the Birkenhead area and was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who believed they knew the woman had gone to the scene to inquire about where she had been found that morning.
Investigations are continuing as the police say they are preparing to inform the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to go back to his house but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he realized what had happened.
The inhabitants were told that it would take hours before they were allowed to return to the house.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area was being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the door, her eyes full of tears.
She kept repeating What a terrible thing.
At 2 p.m. two police cars collided with a single truck outside.
Some officers stood in the clearance to inspect the area of the houses.
Anyone with information is requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers privately on 0800 555 111 using the 247 hotline by 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament became the latest monument to speak out against the rewriting of history.
The curse would be the result of a policy of destruction of England's cultural, religious and historical sites by the Taliban as perpetrated by its radical followers.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr. Crick's decision as a folly and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of the statue that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the target of attack.
Attacking the most important elements of the English civil wars was not something Cromwell ordered to be done or to be done.
Perhaps the worst thing that would come after Cromwell was the legacy of his great-grandfather Thomas centuries earlier.
There is a great commentary on Cromwell's Sa William Hamo Thorneycroft which becomes the 19th century's arguments of opinion and which is part of the historical epitaph of a legendary figure that most believe should still be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more in the last decades of the 19th century than today, as the protector of Parliament from external pressure, in the inevitable crisis of the monarchy.
Whether that explanation would be something entirely accurate remains a matter of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the turmoil of the mid-17th century changed the course of our nation's future, and Cromwell was a prominent figure representing one side of that turmoil.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and commemorated.
Chinese Farmer Killed by a Pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to reports from local media.
The man identified only by his nickname of "Yuan", was found in a woman with a severed neck vein, all covered in blood near a stall in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post newspaper.
A pig farmer arranges for pigs to be vaccinated at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining and Qinghai Province, China.
It was reported that he and his brother had left the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found a woman, and he saw a door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the barn there was a large male pig with blood on his head.
A scientific investigation of the incident confirmed that the 550-kg pig crushed the farmer to death, according to the report.
My brother's legs were covered in blood and bent over, the cousin pronounced his nickname with Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40am on Thursday morning to give food to his staff.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A shop manager told the Evening News that the pig was covered to prevent him from attacking another man, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
It was reported that the Yuan family and the market authorities were in talks to pay compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man in a badly bruised state.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig lured a Welsh farmer into his tent until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive but bloodlust could be a factor.
They were just playing.
They are addicted, curious... they are not out to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As forecasts indicate, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters off the coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was seen 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm began to build over the Pacific Ocean where it moved eastward towards the U.S. Black Sea Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California coast on Monday as a major hurricane it would begin to push the heat wave northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the heated clouds combined with the frontal tides would create a rain shower that would reach large areas of the southwest in the days ahead.
Domestically, 1 to 14 inches of rainfall would cause severe flooding, fossil flooding and possible landslides in the desert.
Extreme humidity could result in rainfall estimates that would experience 2 to 3 inches per hour in the areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flooding due to the increasing climate change and the volatility of rainfall in the tropics.
It was a bad idea to go out into the desert on foot to see the threat of tropical rain.
Excessive rainfall can cause streams to become rivers and the runoff can cause dust and dust to form.
The storm surge would bring heavy rainfall locally to portions of Southern California's coast.
There is a possibility of having a total rainfall of over one inch, which would cause a small amount of debris flow and make the roads slippery.
This would be the first rain of the province's winter season.
A tropical downpour will begin to hit Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the heavy rains become widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue into Wednesday.
October could see another severe cyclonic storm across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes this can lead to dramatic changes in conditions for sometimes brief periods.
There was another great example of the extraordinary weather variations across Central America on Sunday.
There is a difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of summer will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm spell beginning in October with random 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is at least 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability forecast of moderate weather for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million people watched the deposition of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who sued him for alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six national television networks.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued, with the media interrupting the usual schedule for a Friday night surprise: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had been drinking and had tried to strip her at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh, in a heartbreaking testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
No wonder that more than 20.4 million people according to Nielsen's report watched the show.
The company has calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate reports for the other networks that aired the episode, which included PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring the number of people in their offices.
To put it in perspective, that's like the size of the audience at the basketball game you win at the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose analysts strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing and throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was very high after the hearing.
Flake was a prominent center in the Friday series.
After the moderate Republican National Committee released a statement that it would nominate Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday shouting at protesters as he attempted to climb a staircase to the top floor of the House Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood with his eyes on the floor for several minutes as the screaming, televised by CNN, was going on.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth about the country?
He was told, "Be strong when many women are weak".
Flake asked his office to release a statement and said that, before the transmitter shut down, he had much to say to the committee's spokesman.
Cable networks and broadcasters all broadcast the event hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to refer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for another vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the case against the man named next week, which a minority Democrat hopes.
Flake was content to have a brief chat with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a meeting with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's nomination is strong, as it is clear that Republicans will not vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the alleged Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has criticised Brexit critics and politicians
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "politically compromising" Britain's future and undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Summit in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview ahead of the one featured on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson defended his attack on her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the European Union should take each other's exit money was "absolutely ridiculous".
Shot of Wayde Sims  Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the scuffle between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene where they also said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB report linked to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he pleaded guilty to Wayde's fatal shooting.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office of the Coroner released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that went through the neck.
The department commended Louisiana State Police officers who arrested the fugitive, the state's Criminal Science Laboratory, Southern University police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement officials for their work in ensuring justice is done.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and a rebounding average of 2.6 in another season last year.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was shocked and saddened by Wayde's death.
"This is what people worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
A stream of lava flowing from the huge Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Risk Reduction warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after it reached its peak in an eruption that recorded the release of 183 tonnes of gas and ash for more than 24 hours.
The center monitors earthquakes and earthquakes.
Pictures on social media showed a thick ring of ash sticking to the windows of cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Meteorologists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been erupting since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan independence activists before the independence day parade
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as tens of thousands joined a counter-demonstration to celebrate the referendum day that divided Catalonia on the issue of apartheid.
A group of blindfolded supporters were arrested by the police and were beaten with batons and sprayed with paint, creating a dark cloud in the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
A fight broke out later in the day when the police used their batons to break up the fight.
For over several hours the mobs of supporters of the coup chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" and clashed with the protesters who wanted to unite shouting, God has brought Spain down.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, as reported by local media.
There is still a lot of violence in the province that has put independence at its heart a year after the October 1 referendum which Madrid considers illegal but Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters voted heavily in favor of independence although there was little turnout with those who did not want to be corrupted abstaining from the vote.
According to Catalan authorities at least 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to disrupt the voting process at polling stations across the province amid riots.
Crowds of pro-independence demonstrators marched outside at night in support of the National Guard.
The uprising continued but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, a Latino who participated in the pro-independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer hoped for the possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
Last year we lived through one of our best times.
I watched my parents crying for joy for the right to vote but now we are stuck in it, he said.
Despite holding a significant victory in the disputed local elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year with many of their prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their role in the referendum and their subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who had been taking part in protests with the support of the police on his phone, said the crisis was fuelled by politicians on all sides.
It's getting dirtier, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would stand in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car was broken into at home
The men, aged 33, 34 and 29, were arrested after a small car was forced into a house in Londonderry.
It happened in the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Assistant Superintendent Bob Blemmings said that doors were broken and his own home was also damaged.
On another occasion, a small car was struck by arrows and fleas.
The win by Menga gave Livingston a 1 and 0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's win gave Livingston his first win
The promoted Livingston surprised Rangers by saving Steven Gerrard only to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack was a turning point because Gary Holt's side moved the ball with Hibernian in the second leg.
Gerrard's side are currently without a win in the Premiership this season and will face Leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Meanwhile, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livinsgton, have extended their unbeaten streak in the county to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste the beat since he replaced Kenny Miler a month ago.
Livingston's lost their season over their unprecedented visitors
It should be noted that Holt's team was in the lead before they won, with their own face causing the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson entered but pulled his front-row effort to win, only for Alan Lithgow to face his own effort after landing to join the knockout of Craig Halkett.
The home fans agreed to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could trouble the visitors in the line-up.
And that is how the important feeding took place.
The Rangers agreed to a no-hitter and Livingston acted with a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to design the Menga, which he touched and scored from the center of the box.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball holding but found the home defense would not allow a pass and the ball catcher Liam Kelly and was completely uninvolved.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman missed an opportunity by the foot of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow opened well from a match organised by Livingston.
Then the same beat was used to go to the Livingston box where their match was continued, during which a head-to-head goal - after Halkett's challenge to replace Glenn Middleton, and another for a touchdown - was scored.
The wonder from Livingston - a study
Alasdair Lamont Scotland in the District of Tony Macaroni
A surprising match with results for Livingston.
To one man, they were impressive, going beyond what was expected of this celestial creation.
Their style of playing and personnel has changed slightly since their return to the top level, but the main credit should go to Holt and the way he has kept the team together since his arrival.
He has many giants.
Captain Halkett was ready, having arranged a very good defense, when Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet completely.
The Rangers almost lost their courage, almost.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to achieve such a balance.
Their last wall was not enough - they only cut open the side of the house once - and it was a refreshing call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a kind of reception in Cologne
A variety of blue and green sky was seen on Saturday (September 29) where Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
In her final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was designed to repair relations between the NATO allies.
They found themselves at odds with one another over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of about 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - have raised their voices, unanimously condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back to the country.
The scene's comic relief features the split arrival of a magician whom the German Turks hail as a hero and a puppet as a trickster to the rest.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a small car in London.
The crash happened near the junction of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after a cyclist was killed in a head-on collision on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a riot
Six officers were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" special forces were brought in to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was narrowed to one side.
The officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
According to a spokesperson for the Prisons Department: Specialised trained staff were dispatched to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We do not expect any riots in our prison, and they have stated that those involved will be moved and there is a possibility of them hiding behind the counter.
The HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had received medical attention after being attacked by another inmate.
And in October of last year, riot police dealt with a violent incident where workers were attacked with footballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and flooding in the area
It is uncommon for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is what may have happened as early as the following week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosan tracks its path across the Southeastern Desert, where it creates the risk of rising flooding.
The National Weather Service has already released flood watch data for the Monday and Tuesday edge flooding for Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa was expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, pushing through late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a Twitter post that only 10 major hurricanes have produced a tropical depression or a tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) and a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models give an average of 2 to 4 inches of rain, with as many as 6 inches missing in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest that include the central Rockies and the Great Basin are unlikely to have increments of 1 to 2 with a total of no more than about 4 possible increments.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, the Rosa's rains may be a bit of a nightmare since the region is suffering from a drought.
Although the floods are a cause for concern, some of this rainfall will benefit since the South-West is now experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Management Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one severe drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Initially, Hurricane Rosa's path was to run down the coast of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still a strong tropical storm on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving at 12 miles per hour.
The ice melts into the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and the ice melts.
As a result, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico in the heat of the summer and in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Not surprisingly, parts of northern Mexico have experienced heavy rains, creating a risk of severe flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to the southwest of Sonora, according to weather.com.
From there Rosa will travel north across Mexico as a tropical cyclone before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, from where it will move upward through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest risk from Rosa or its remnants is the possibility of heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These waters are expected to produce flooding and fossil effluents in the deserts, and erosion in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found with injuries in the Excelsior Square area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in critical condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon area according to Somerset Police.
The officials have asked anyone who may have a mobile video of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the "depression, anger, and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is one vote for the ruthless and aggressive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had incurred the wrath of the Democratic Party by pushing his name.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and angrily denying a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her many years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her invention.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the skill and bravery of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh West is one vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, a jurist with an outstanding record of public service", West Virginia supporters said in a public forum.
The president made a few comments about the transfer of Kavanaugh's name while talking about the utility of the Republican exit in the midterm elections.
Five weeks remain for one of the most important decisions of our lifetime.
I won't stop, but I will stop, he said.
That's why I've been fighting for the big candidates all my life.
Trump's debate Democrats are on a mission to hate and violate the burqa.
The first major step toward a vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds were killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, and to see more deaths
At least 384 people were killed, including some who were on board as high waves washed ashore, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu on Friday as the high tides (18 knots) pounded the coast at night, sweeping many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were then doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately flee the area where they became victims,  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's BNPB Risk Reduction Agency in a brief interview with journalists in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came by itself, dragging away small cars, logs, houses, and hitting everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial footage taken by the disaster agency again showed damaged buildings and shops, bent bridges and the ruins of a mosque surrounded by water.
The previous earthquakes that had devastated the coastal city on the Sabbath had continued.
The earthquake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Planning and Technology (BPPT) in a statement said the magnitude of the earthquake released on Friday was nearly 200 times the energy of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The climate of the city, which sits at the tip of a small, elongated ridge, may have contributed to the size of the tsunami, the engineer said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said tens of thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were all destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found piled up under the collapsed buildings, the official said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage would increase sharply along the coastline 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala,
Communications have completely stopped and there is no news from Donggala, the nephew of Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had reached the affected areas.
This is a tragic situation, but it could get worse, she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to warn of a tsunami that would hit Palu, although officials said the waves came in between when the warning was issued.
A non-professional video shared on social media can be heard a man on the roof of a building shaking a warning of an approaching tsunami to people in the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water collapsed on the sea, sweeping away buildings and small cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power and communication blackouts around Palu, creating difficulties for authorities in coordinating rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending large cargo planes and aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but those evacuated are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's only airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800
A Lot of Damage.
Although World Vision staff safely returned to Palu from Donggala, where the staff were living in the tanfol shelters set up in their office yard, they showed a sense of disruption on the way, said Mr Doseba.
"They said we saw many houses collapsed", he said.
It was very hot.
Despite relief agencies having begun a massive effort to begin disaster relief work, some complained that highly qualified foreign aid workers were being denied access to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, the investment, procurement and recruitment of foreign workers will only begin if the site of the conflict is declared a national disaster camp.
That has not yet happened.
It is still a disaster area, said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, Yes, this will be a national disaster, we will open for international assistance but there is no status yet.
As the second night falls on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the missing are hoping that their relatives will be a miracle that will save the unfortunate victims of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled from a garbage dump.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Team, coached two missing athletes of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of those who were buried in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran of the sport of downhill, I too feel the same anxiety", he said.
Mr. Gendon shared how, in the weeks after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse was broadcast among the downhill ski community, he sent WhatsApp messages over the airwaves to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach party.
His messages, however, only resulted in one grey-painted note, instead of a pair of blue notes.
I think he means not to send messages, he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 during the refill of ATM in Newport on Daɓe
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Davenport, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of a minibus was removing an ATM in a recreation building and packing to bring in more cash, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While he was at work, a man came running after the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money that was to be delivered.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime according to the announcement, but the police did not specify how many were involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper is changing the name - to Ye.
Announcing his name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I would have been known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye for a period of time and used the moniker in the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show which was canceled due to "depressing reasons", according to the show's creator.
As an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has a religious meaning to him.
I believe ye is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you, West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, we are us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means one, to the singular Ye - just another reflection of our beauty, our illusion, everything.
The board is like another reflection of who we are.
He is one of the well-known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that his preferred names are Love and Brother Love.
West's other collaborator, JAY-Z, also did so with or without a short mid-word line and capital letters.
Mexico's government has pledged not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never again use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
The troops fired on a peaceful protest at the center on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when student communist activists were beginning to find refuge in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more public universities free of charge.
He also said that unemployment and lack of education are the main factors that attract young people to the criminal gangs.
The US should defund AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field, said artificial intelligence analyst Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI and artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US has lost an AI strategy in custody.
Meanwhile, China presented its ambition last year: it aims to become the world's first AI-powered nation by 2030.
"The budget for AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for something new in AI", Lee said.
The spending cuts could double the chances of achieving the next big AI in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures China, which has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the more advanced American game Othello, and later became a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee cited past US government competitions on technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge where he asked when the next one would be held, as it helped identify future remote sensors.
Analysts in the United States often work harder to earn government subsidies, Lee said.
It's not China that hires the academic leaders; it's the corporations, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired top academics from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the changes in national policy could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I feel that the green card should be automatically generated for graduates in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese National People's Congress released the Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence for its Future Nation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals in academia similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the US Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is set to attract contacts from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an effort called AI Next.
In the case of the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a US law that seeks to create a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a move that would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its border and a bid for accession to NATO and the European Union.
Both governments secured a new status in June under a new name they had decided, but anti-Slavs argued the change would reduce the ethnic identity of the vast majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of ouster has raised doubts over whether the turnout will reach the 50 percent threshold needed for a referendum to be successful.
The question on the referendum ballot read: NATO membership and membership of the European Union and the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a sacrifice to pursue membership in institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the states that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia because they can live freely under the banner of the European Union because it means a secure life for us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it lacks judicial power, enough members of the legislature have said they will follow the results of the vote to make it even.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of any problems until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 15 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came out to vote because, as a child, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko have launched their vote in a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the country's name that would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 3, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a mini-manifest and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by the referendum's migrants.
"We are NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with the people, not through the back door of the work", Kavadarkov said.
 We are a poor country, but we are perfect.
If they don't want to consider us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring significant investment to Macedonia, which has an estimated unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I believe many will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO, said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a result of eh would be a guarantee of our destiny.
A public opinion poll published by the Macedonian Resolution Research Institute on Monday said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum and the referendum.
A public opinion poll, by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would like to throw in the towel.
To win the referendum the requirement of the exit was 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first major challenge to the resolve of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero bypasses Brighton's defence all the way for the win
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling pushed Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily showed his humiliation on his own in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a kick to the center of the field at the top of the order.
He ran through Brighton's guards, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four yellow shirts.
He pushed around one guard before avoiding the others on the side of Brighton's box.
He then turned another ball to his right, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first ball in the box to deliver the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to kick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and a small shot into the right side of the goal.
Aguero is struggling with some issues in his fitness, according to a report by City manager Pep Guardiola.
 We talked about it for 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We won another victory this time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League play-offs.
That meal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's goal well in that game.
He sent a good inside-the-park left-handed shot to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few more stops before guiding Sterling to the end of the long-distance stand.
The Sky Blues forward touched the ball into the net just before moving out of bounds.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a wild card with the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from postseason play, there was no reason to force a re-start.
But regular-season fan Scherzer is hoping to pick up the Sunday series against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are only playoff chances for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to seal their first division title.
Even though we're playing a little bit, at least we can play plastic knowing that the weather in Denver is with the crowd and one team will be playing on each of the highest levels of any bull I'll face this year.
Why would I not want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday but are reportedly keen to let Scherzer escalate the situation.
Scherzer, who would be turning 34, threw a perfect time on Thursday and would insist on his perfect rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump marched in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when discussing the merits of the Republican emergence in the midterm elections.
All our efforts have stalled in November.
Five weeks from now from one of the most meaningful decisions of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big - I'm not going to stop but I'm actually going to stop it so I'm all over the place fighting for the city's candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You've seen this tragedy, this tragic group of Democrats, you've seen what's happening right now.
And they are determined to seize power by using every opportunity they can, you see the cruelty, the inhumanity.
Not theirs and who they have offended, who they will destroy to have power and control, that's why what they want is power and control, we will not give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to fight corruption.
And you see that for the past four days, he said, he has called the Democrats  angry and sad and arrogant and dishonest.
He mentioned the senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, to which the audience applauded.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the paper?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one - that's the worst sign of dishonesty - the worst sign of dishonesty I've ever seen.
Now Labour is not a big party.
Another form of impatience is that of those who are open about their feelings
When the Momentum members in my local party voted to end me, it was no surprise.
Since I was the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we were not welcome - all because of the internal conflict.
My friend in Congress Joan Ryan received the same humiliation for taking a stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the issue of the ban has disqualified me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the benefits of a sound economic solution, on national security, on Europe, unfortunately the same issues on which Jeremy has spoken out against past leaders.
A statement for the East Nottingham Labour Conference on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be held in conjunction with the conference".
For most of my eight years as a Labour member of parliament, it was the same on the night of the GC meetings.
Unfortunately today, it is not the form of many conferences and political promises of the ihsani, mind is already forgotten if, even, ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that diversity of opinion is not tolerated in the Labour party and that any opinion is judged on whether it will be accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became president, because colleagues who I felt had the same political leanings began to expect me to make some kind of change and take positions I would never agree with - whether on national security or the single market of the European Union.
I have always spoken in public - and it doesn't matter what I said - only to be vilified on social media with calls for re-election, rejection of centrist politics, and being told I should not be a Labour Party member.
And that was not the only thing I saw.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than many of my colleagues because the orders I face are often political.
I am a little bit of a shock to the experience and determination of these colleagues who face some kind of gender or racial discrimination every day but never run away.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is the prevalence of the stigma of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
What is really happening now is that we are giving that big church any issue of "no-qualification" or changing election laws so that the party becomes smaller.
I have had many calls in the last two years to be quiet, not to make noise and that's why I'm not a problem.
But I did not do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, having been bullied by Thatcher's government ministers and having seen the school curriculum drop, I have imagined myself as a champion of social services for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, even in the last election.
No one from East Nottingham can be said to have been confused about the status of my reservation and areas of disagreement with the current administration.
To those who have promoted the Friday issue, all I can say is that at a time when the country is heading towards another Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government jobs, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to work for the public and I promise that no threat of re-election or political fraud will stop me from working in what I believe is the best interests of the public as a whole.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated to the top
Two late tests had skipped the final result of some sort, but there was no doubt Ayr had been fit to win in this spectacular recreation of the Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the decade.
Ultimately, their higher scoring, as well as their better speaking opportunities, took the side of the house and the players' coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
 We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took their responsibilities much more seriously than we did".
A 14-minute test of Anderson's contribution, substituted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, however, a dance card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, and the Warriors again for the match, left Melrose to score against Jason Baggot
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, at half-time, he scored a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half right and Patrick Anderson made a try, with Baggot substituted, cutting the pass to five steps.
There was during a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was picked up on the bench, and the restart, Ayr pushed the forward forward upper leg through a Stafford McDowall test, which Climo replaced.
Then-captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose had the man pay for another unforced Bruce Colvine test, eventually a fatal pressure attack.
The home side came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card for the Climo's goalless pass, from the penalty area, MacPherson touched the ground from behind Ayr's approaching shot.
Climo was relegated, as he was again at least from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected a David Armstrong box and sent Gregor Henry out for a fifth-round home-field try.
Still star Game is ready for a new job in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has revealed he plans to enter the care industry after it was discovered he was offered a position as director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old is starring as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, which he co-wrote with fellow star comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the running of the programme, and revealed Kiernan was preparing a life after Craiglang.
According to the company's written serial history, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun newspaper rumored that Kiernan was looking to join the Glasgow Food and Beverage Market.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia is covered in land and hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the docks of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Government buildings hoisted the blue flag of the sea.
Marine flags from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with the motto: The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to bring him back.
Across the entire Bolivian-surrounded land mass, the memory of losing a piece of coastline to Chile in a devastating 19th-century resource crisis is still vividly visible - because it was their need to navigate the waters of the Pacific Ocean once again.
These types of cases are perhaps more prominent in recent years, as Bolivia awaits a lower court ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of hearings.
"Bolivia has an energetic, united and stable spirit, and certainly expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on major television networks across the country, hoping that the Hague court will find a consensus to accept Bolivia's request that - after years of unsuccessful negotiations - Chile agree to negotiate giving Bolivia a free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's popular white president - who faces a confusing battle for re-election next year - has a big chance of winning Monday's ruling.
We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean, in a statement in late August.
But some pirates believe that it will be difficult for Bolivia to make the decision it wants - and that nothing will change if it does.
The United Nations Commission based in the Netherlands has no authority to give the Chilean border, and has stated that it will not be able to determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The World Court's decision comes just six months after the final jury hearing showed the case was "not a sham", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And nowhere near the legal aid of Bolivia, the past four years have probably brought her back.
The Bolivian government has now restricted access to the coast, Zárate said.
The unkindness of Morales has ended all Chilean sympathy, in my opinion.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied the claim that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new chapter of relations with Chile and an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of conflict and mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular leaders - had used the maritime issue as a political tool.
He added that "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
The sentence was an opportunity to see that what happened was forgotten.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come until it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never give up its nuclear weapons from the start unless it trusts Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the US to follow through on the commitments made at the summit in Singapore between the future leaders.
His calls come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is poised to resume his successful nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just a "dream" that the US continued to impose sanctions against a proposal that would end the Korean War and bring the North to its knees.
Washington is hesitant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant commitment to disarmament.
Overall Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread disagreement that Pyongyang is not fully committed to abandoning a weapon the country sees as its almost only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit with Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show unveils the latest line in your clothing on its way to a Big Tits near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection or block out the sun, then don't go any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne displayed their SS19 line of oversized headwear on the runway that embellished the fashion set at Paris Fashion Week.
The unimaginable has dominated Instagram this winter and these designers have poured their creative eye into the fashion show floor.
What emerged from Valentino was a top hat worn with a hair that dominated the head of the models.
Other major supports include a decorative helmet, a helmet and a pineapple - but they are not designed to warm you up.
Thom Browne also invented a unique selection of masks - and only for the Halloween season.
Many of the colorful face socks have a seam in the lip and look more like Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture style.
One of the bones resembles a scuba diving suit with a snorkel and a tube, and the other resembles a molten milk jug.
And if you stick to the main point about dress - you win.
Fashion critics predicted that big bonnets could start to make their way onto the main streets near you.
The big hats come handy on the 'La Bomba' high-heeled shoes, a ripped cap with two short feathers seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat's highly-popular look was broadcast on social media sending a huge creative to the fashion show floor - for a beach suitcase almost as big as a model swimsuit being worn in the water.
The orange bag, trimmed with a side-by-side overhead raffia of a white leather jacket, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags come on the high street for the next winter - because the designer has made such a big impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories".
John Edward: The importance of linguistic knowledge for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools hold a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a segment of the exam results that were exceptional, which was only encouraged by individual achievement combined with in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
With an additional 30,000 school children across Scotland, these schools, which are run by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are expanding to provide a better platform of work for young children and their parents.
Private schools have the objective of preparing their children for further higher education, their chosen life path and their place as global citizens.
As a branch of knowledge that can design and implement a spoken school curriculum, we see modern languages increasingly becoming a popular and preferred elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent examinations of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking with the highest scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A plus.
Data, collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students scored an A-level in Mandarin, followed by 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also scored an A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as an elective subject, held in the same status as STEM subjects (science, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent attributed to some inadequate language skills.
Knowledge of several languages is therefore once again essential in order to prepare young people for the challenges of life.
With the increasing job opportunities available to those who need languages, these skills are essential in a highly connected world.
Regardless of what career one chooses for life, if they learn a second language, they will be aiming for a wise long-term future benefit such as:
Having the opportunity to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will immediately put a multilingual individual on top of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults, 75% found it difficult to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only spoken language at a rate of just a two-digit subset of the numerator, at 15%.
That is why investing in language education now is beneficial for children tomorrow.
Having access to several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children a good chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages it teaches.
Most schools will focus on more advanced modern languages, but others will teach languages deemed most relevant to England in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a selection of languages available from private schools, with teachers who are experts in the area.
Scotland's private schools are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and give them the strength of the skills required to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to play a useful role for the future of the country, so this must be put into the knowledge.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as a global communication network.
Private schools will continue to provide this choice, and socialism will continue to be the norm for young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make the Lakers appear on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he just doesn't know how long he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and closer to 48", Walton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter that James would likely play the last minute.
After the preseason tryouts earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, the YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a series of meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump rallies over the coming week that included stops at friendly sites in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the confirmation ballot he chose to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of the House of Representatives by the time the November vote is called.
When is Trump's night meeting for West Virginia and how can I watch it online?
The Trump Summit is scheduled for Wheeling, West Virginia at 7pm on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the West Virginia Trump rally online below when it is live on YouTube.
Trump was not surprised to speak out against this week's argument for the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been persecuted on sexual assault charges and is expected to be suspended by the Senate for another week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the protest rally was to help the Republicans facing the November elections gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign says the goal of these five meetings over the coming week is to "pull together the volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress administration is so important to his agenda that the president will be visiting more states as we enter the offseason", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters but declined to be named.
The plan, which is for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight will bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media to Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump was trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that until the president comes in to try to add another whistle to his selection", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show up to fight for the hopes of the top contender on Sunday
After one-sided times, Saturday's four-out-of-four match will probably just be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The change in attitude of a young athlete is a matter of sport in general but one in which the athletes truly believe, and it has never been the case even in competitions like these.
So where do they say the fountain is now?
"The name has six points on the front and now it's four, so we're treating that as a little bit of a starting point in my mind", Jordan Spieth said as he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, in fact, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have little help in the matter though they have a lot to cheer them on, the least it is the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got off with three out of four points.
Spieth was a toxin from tee to green and leading by example.
The festive shouts rang out as his circle continued, drowning a key to taking the square as he and Thomas were both shot dead.
His attempt to win the game on the 15th met with such a response, which shows you he believes that the American team is not a part of this.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your game", Spieth says.
He's all of those players gone now.
18 holes to make another point.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an incomplete legend of Ryder Club.
The most desirable European couples are four out of four and they are not going to do anything wrong.
The two became the only Hollywood couple to not shoot a target on Saturday afternoon but also avoided a shoot-out on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and after nine on Friday morning.
This is over, and as their energy passes completely from the arrival and the crowd's enthusiasm that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more players to cover any possible European victory as the sun rises over Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
If desired all at the same time in different holes.
The glory of Europe is yet to be revealed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played the role of Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball champion, when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and a double-headed forward threw the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they never got close to exiting.
On Sunday, though, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four joints are interesting at least from close up because of the interaction between the two joints, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a given situation.
Europe have played well as a team so far and became leaders on the final day but this time the quarter-finals also show that Team USA is up for a fight and that, especially Stateside, they are in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a useful advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming off of Saturday's four-point win and four-game win streak with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The two-time champions Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the change with two wins on top of Tiger Woods' struggling to lift the number so far at Le Golf National to four-pointers.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, the title holders, had failed to win at Hazeltine two years earlier, and had to overcome a disappointing loss at the American side in the morning's four-ball tie, where they took a 3-1 series lead.
The United States added a four-quarter lead, winning two games, but were unable to win the series.
Jim Furyk's side needed points from each of the 12 Sunday matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four goals in a season when he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a weekend of talk and are the only pair to score four goals from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals they then went on to beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a spectacular 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself into a two-game stretch on Saturday, showed a clear academic edge but has now lost 19 of his last 24 games in a row and 44 of his last 27 games in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning's four goals, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a four-on-four match to a 2-1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the number one and number three in the world.
Europe has not gotten as easy as it should, the windy southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set another streak for the Americans with a two-point conversion on Saturday.
They had a disappointing 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm Ian Poulter in four rounds and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four-hole match after losing the opening two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point loss in singles, although as the holders of the Furyk division only need a horse's stance to hold the cup.
After being the second best for two days, however, a repeat attack on Sunday looked like it would be too much for them.
North Korea says it 'doesn't know how' to reduce its weapons alone without a truce
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are increasingly pushing its mistrust of the United States and that there is no way the country will abandon its nuclear arsenal alone under any circumstances.
Ri Yong told the World Commission's Annual General Meeting that North Korea has taken "five decent steps" in the past year, such as suspending nuclear and ballistic missile tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not seen any response from the US", he said.
Without any security of the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way for us alone to disarm in the first place.
While Rike found the repeated complaints of South Korea's notorious refusal by Washington to follow a "steady" path to nuclear disarmament under which it would be rewarded for taking other gradual steps towards North Korea, his speech appeared significant because it did not reject nuclear disarmament alone as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint speech by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between the US leader and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "the denuclearization of Korea" while Trump pledged to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons from the start.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease country-by-country sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has been committed to nuclear disarmament from the beginning" and has increased the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as rejecting the notion of an end to war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued restrictions are increasing our disbelief.
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president had spoken of at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead the minister referred to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the country involved in this denuclearization issue is South Korea it would be the United States and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that would not have had such a problem.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was slightly different from that of last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US-Korea relations were something he had to address after Mr. President Seeking Disaster Trup called Kim a man rocket who was looking for suicide.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to totally destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still work to be done and sanctions remained in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions enforcement must continue unabated until we see a fully verified nuclear phase-out".
The Security Council has generally imposed increasing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly where he said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times since this year, but his visit has not been particularly well received.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but in the meantime North Korea had abandoned its demands as a terrorist threat.
North Korea has promised at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a missile test site and a nuclear facility if the US takes a few steps in the opposite direction.
He said Kim told him that "other measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep in an attempt to reduce the risk of reading errors by drinking coffee every night.
A professor has found that students at some of the world's best universities have little or no knowledge of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was lured to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
 Finally one girl came to me and said: Why did we only get this in my senior year?
She said no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep - which surprised her, she told The Telegraph.
The course started its first session this year, where students were explained the benefits of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university made the decision to introduce the course after finding that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The other hour-long session included a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a chapter of a dormitory, where students press coffee cups, envelopes, coaches and books to tell them about the effects of cold and light and how the workplace environment affects sleep deprivation, and the benefits of a bedtime ritual.
In one section, patients are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A school map, with interactive symbols, then encouraged the participants to reflect on what they do in their daily lives.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler added.
The tradition of staying in the 'all-night' room is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is becoming a growing problem.
The guarantee of getting enough sleep, a good one, should become a student's secret weapon to combat depression, fatigue and anxiety, and to keep him/her - or to avoid becoming obese, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of malnutrition, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California-based biochemist and biologist, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his previous year's classes during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and motivated him to push for the course throughout the school.
Hoping for the next step, he would require all students in the department of further postgraduate studies to complete a similar course of study before they enter a competing school.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should take care to set an alarm for when to go to sleep, even when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "red light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can throw your health system into a state of sleeplessness, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 vs Rangers 0: Eating Menga humiliated the Gerrard team
Rangers got a setback when Dolly Menga's attack cut short Steven Gerrard's split side to score 1 and 0 at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to make their first win on the road since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side pulled off only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager where he left his side with eight goals in the process to knock out Ladbrokes Hearts Premiership leaders.
The Bengals were on the attack seven minutes into the half and a short strike of the Rangers line on the touchdown never looked like a draw.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston are up to third and just behind Hibernian on points difference.
And there could be more tension in the offing for the Rangers after then-line guard Calum Spence was treated for a knee injury after apparently being thrown something from the other end of the pitch.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that dropped Ayr in the matches before the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11 that had pulled the Hearts from the playoffs the week before and had been delighted with how his coaches had beaten their opponents in every round.
It would seem that the Rangers dominated the ball but Livingston did a lot with the ball they got.
They should have scored in the opening two minutes when the first goalkeeper scored Scott Pittman's goal to take down Allan McGregor but the central defender extended his chances significantly.
Another unstoppable shot by Keaghan Jacobs found goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only extend behind the bench.
The Rangers have taken control but there is more hope than agreement about their play in the final three.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have scored a header in the third quarter of the half as he and Steven Lawless collided but the referee Steven Thomson missed the Colombian's goal.
Rangers tried to just hit the first second half of the second period on the attack but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly showed no concern from Lassana Coulibaly's header and another quick attack by Ovie Ejaria.
As Livi's 34-minute goal was scored on a replay, no one could deny that they deserved it for the simple fact that they got it.
The Rangers failed to deal with another Jacobs injury.
Scott Arfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cold for carrying the ball for a small goal.
Gerrard acted in the break where he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost made an immediate impact as the attacking wing cornerback scored a touchdown to Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran out of his lineup to block.
But Livingston continued to kick the fans back to the real game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett getting the ball high up behind the ball.
Holt's side had extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor held firm and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow's shot was taken from the bowl.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton scored a last-second penalty in which he scored a try with Jacobs but Thomson was overruled.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, is also FUNNELY FARMED... the day the future world-renowned meteorologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger built a system to detect and measure the working state of the steam, an invention that led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A scientific powerhouse since then, the Geiger Counter became a reference in popular culture during its golden age, where in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", the unseen scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to detect minerals, such as uranium.
While wearing these headphones, you can actually feel the chemical reactions of the atomic reactions produced by the vapor in the resource.
Evans: "You say, 'It's coming out right now!'"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the remnant that bears his name is alive and well.
A new tuberculosis vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the problematic cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to identify and kill problem cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells as part of the treatment
Methods include extracting immune cells from a patient, culturing them in a laboratory
They can then extract a nutrient that most cancers recognize and then re-introduce it
An experimental vaccine shows positive results in patients with a rare form of the cancer.
One woman who received a hysterectomy, which teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells, saw her uterine cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in a laboratory to make a protein known to many cancers as HER2, and then re-inserting them into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that there is a vaccine that can be used".
Professor Berzofsky notes that HERS "is associated with the development of many types of cancer", including breast, uterine, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar technique of taking cells from a patient's body and "training" them to attack cancer cells has been used in treating a similar disease.
Kanye West starts attacking Trump haters, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
Unreasonable
Kanye West was booed in the broadcast booth during Saturday Night Live after a rant in which he praised the President of the United States.Donald Trump also said he would seek reelection in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he passed out with a rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"On several occasions I have spoken to a white person and they said: "How can you like Trump, he has a gender bias?"
Well, if I was worried about gender inequality I would have left the US long ago", he said.
SNL premiered the show with a parody of Matt Damon's appearance in which the Hollywood star provided a satirical take on Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary regarding the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, a short video of West's performance was uploaded by Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to discredit West with his release.
Similarly, West complained to the audience that he suffered backstage from what was happening to him.
"Behind the scenes, they bullied me.
"Don't go out there wearing that hat", they said.
They treated me badly!
And they said I'm a green man", he said as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
West continues: Would you like to see a green workplace? saying "I'll wear a grown man's helmet, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep going?
Try love".
His comments drew at least two-fold outcry from the audience and members who appeared on SNL were shamed, according to a Variety report, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio is silent".
West was brought in as the final replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing a song titled Love It, dressed as a Perrier jug.
West was backed by the leader of the anti-colonial TRUSA group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the brave: WE WILL NOT BLOOD YOUR BLOOD AND YOUR HUMBLE".
But host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was just "exhibiting who he is and that's a very interesting thing".
"But I choose not to give gifts to anyone (by buying their music or merchandise or showing appreciation for their "intellect") who I believe is spreading and promoting a belief that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
She added, "We are".
Before the show, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "the other person I used to be known as Kanye West".
He was not the first musician to change his name and follow in their footsteps Diddy, who was known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His cousin rapper Snoop Dogg previously went by the name Snoop Lion and the famous singer Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and the singer was previously known as Prince.

The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, has criticized the use of youth
Kit Harington is known for portraying the role of sword-wielding Jon Snow in the HBO thriller series Game of Thrones.
But the film's director, 31, criticized the hero's character, saying that such roles imply that young children often feel they must be a bit of a failure to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of male genital mutilation in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, who is also 31, confirmed that he feels 'very strongly' about tackling the issue.
I feel in my body, very strong, at that moment - where did we go wrong with the giant man?,' he said.
What lessons have we been teaching our boys in their adulthood, in view of the present crisis?'
Kit believes that television will be a little bit of a right to continue this male-dominated craze because of the male superheroes being released.
He continued: What is the human body and what has it been taught?
What is taught on television, on the street, that makes little children feel that they must be like a man?
I feel that this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because clearly something is wrong with the young men.'
In an interview he also confirmed that he would not be reprising Game of Thrones when the series came to an end next season, saying that it was 'over the battlefield and horses'.
From November Kit will appear in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robbery thief with a gun.
The actor said that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this program, so in this way he gave me my future family, and life will start from here,' he said.
Rose appeared in Ygritte, Kit's comedic love interest in Jon Snow, in this film for which she won an Emmy Award.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Leslie family's home in Scotland.
STROS/Immunodeficiency: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced the deaths of 14 percent of its population living with HIV and other autoimmune diseases.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
Almost 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new infections are spread through sex, which has changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spreading rapidly in parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV through this method has dropped to almost zero, according to health officials in a clinic in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sexual contact is a hot topic in China's gay and lesbian community.
The ban on homosexuality was lifted in China in 1997, but discrimination against gays and lesbians is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's culture of homosexuality, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease comes from the lack of adequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to achieve international access to HIV vaccines as part of an effort to ease the situation.
Maxine Waters denies leaking allegations that her employee leaked GOP Senate records, which she angrily called 'slanderous' and 'hypocritical'
US Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed rumors that a member of her staff leaked the privacy statements of three Republican US senators on the Congressmen's pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat newspaper confirmed that the rumors were some "ideological" and were spread by the cybernetics.
Lies, lies, and more lies, Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked data is said to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, which was shared by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against his nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The bill came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the leaked portal was linked to the Waters office" that leaked the information of a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
This unsubstantiated theory is completely false and a complete lie, Waters continued.
The strength of my staff - whose evidence, credentials, and protection have been melted by these rumors and false allegations - are not the cause of this information leak.
This unfounded myth is a lie and a blatant lie".
Waters' speech drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This animosity is ironic, in Fleischer's writing.
This indicates she is not the type to become a Member of Parliament.
In the case of someone being accused of something they did not do, they must not become bitter.
They would not have to compromise.
They would not necessarily question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and collected".
Fleischer was coming out for an analogy to Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate seeking to take over Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"No doubt if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent complaints.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, "and will be held accountable for all their acts that are degrading and harmful to everyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Repeats commentary - Rowan Atkinson is the most powerful spy
It's now a tradition to see the Brexit benefit in every film with a British actor and that doesn't mean it's going to run to this revival of the Johnny English comedy - which originally premiered back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived live in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it by a mere irony of the obvious that we can be said to be a newly independent country?
In any case, the eye came out to the plastic face of the unsuccessful Johnny English who had obtained his license to design new things for the second time - this name of his implied more than anything else that he was an invention of a wide-ranging game designed for non-English-speaking movie-goers.
He is in fact a very silly spy despite his apparent brand-new outfit that makes Clouseau's son, a work of Mr. Bean and a work by the same man contribute as a single lyric to the soundtrack of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
And it was also the original based on the traveler and international figure Atkinson had once played in the now-forgotten television commercial for Barclaycard, leaving a vivid impression in his wake.
There are one or two good features in this latest edition of JE.
I love the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a vintage suit of armor and with rotor blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is often displayed in a very public way, but the comedy seems to be very weak and shallow, especially considering that popular "comedy" films such as the 007 and Mission Impossible series themselves now boldly present comedy as their own flavor.
The comedy feels like it's geared towards children rather than adults, and to me the horror that Johnny English sees is not so much of a comedy and facing the Atkinson's shadow as of Bean's character.
The point of the discussion was that Great Britain was in a very turbulent situation.
A hacker has infiltrated the British intelligence agency's online network, revealing the identities of all British agents within the unit, in a shameful act of deception - a minor misrepresentation of Kevin Eldon's minor role.
It was the final straw for a sensitive and controversial prime minister, already suffering from the meltdown of political infamy: Emma Thompson did her best with a similarly unorthodox attitude to Theresa May but little else in the way of action.
Her undercover advisors told her that almost every spy had been compromised, and she had to bring one of them in.
And that means Johnny English himself, now working as a school teacher in a good institution, but leaving lessons in how to become a professional spy: some pretty good gags here, as English provides a study of spy of some sort.
English was pulled back to Whitehall for another emergency briefing and a reunion with his former assistant on the Bough side, was held up against Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, involved with a ship's captain, a kind of unpleasant role in which Vicki Pepperdine becomes a temporary distraction.
So Batman and Robin make a bad mistake on the Queen's Secret Service return to work, meeting with the beautiful woman problem Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Right now, the prime minister is failing miserably under the influence of a coveted tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer disaster: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began to review their plans: hidden as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant's lights; they created a commotion where they soothed themselves by enjoying the Volta's boat; and English was outraged by the lawlessness in which he attempted to use a Virtual Reality headset to identify himself with the Volta's cabin.
It was actually all stripped down for the final series, but despite how beautiful and big it was, there was a children's TV show about the whole thing.
The standard of good order.
And with the rest of the Johnny English films I can't stop thinking: why wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to play that would actually do justice to his genius?
Labour has rejected proposals for a four-day work week for British workers with five days pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a master plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
According to reports the party wants company executives to hand over the money saved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees by giving them an extra day off.
He would see the workers enjoying a three-day weekend - and still receiving the same pay.
The newspapers said the strategy would 'fit in' with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into what the workers want.
The move to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the economic transformation.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A review of the resolution is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen in one day but a four-day work week is a necessary attraction in the party's approach to economic rehabilitation for the worker and even the whole party's strategy to the industry.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to adopt such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party is now less sympathetic to the attraction in general, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day work week is not a party resolution and the party is considering it.'
The moderate John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour summit to express what he sees as a revolution of socialist thinking in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was ready to curb control from 'hidden directors' and 'greedy profiteers' in public sector companies.
The low tariff plans also mean that investors now in shipping companies will not get a full return on their investment because a Labour government could 'cut' on what is seen as inappropriate grounds.
It also confirmed plans to incorporate employees into the company board and create Non-Propriate Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who can earn annual benefits of up to almost 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's fictional investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nominee by at least a week, and raised questions whether the agency's findings will draw any Republican senators into their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy described him as no more unhinged than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, Mr. Kennedy.
"I said I would go into the hearing room, and I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that was obvious, I said, 'Did you send it?'
It was unbroken, ready, and unshakable".
Graham's election, however, appears to have been scheduled to take place.
"My heart is clear about Brett Kavanaugh and he will take a little more serious responsibility", he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it very strongly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever named him failed to identify him.
It was 36 years.
I don't see anything new".
What Is a Nation-Building Event, and Has It Reduced Poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the World Citizens' Day, an annual music festival with a big impact that will bring together stars who will be on another exciting mission; to end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Day will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy celebrations by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the festival's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Action on Poverty, an international coalition that hopes to end extreme poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To receive a free ticket to the service (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of scheduled activities, or "activities" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other means of raising awareness of their cause to end poverty.
But how far has the League of Nations progressed in the 12 years that have left it in its quest?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert a good way to attract people to a particular call to action, or is it just another form of "clicktivism" - people feel like they are actually making a difference by signing a web petition or sending a tweet to someone?
Since 2011, Citizens of the World says it has collected more than 19 million "projects" from its supporters, pushing various goals.
He said that these activities have helped to attract world leaders to announce pledges and resolutions worth an estimated $37 billion that are projected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people globally by 2030.
In early 2018, the group brought 390 pledges and declarations that came from its activities, where at least 10 billion dollars had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the financial impact directly affects approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the notable commitments include the Nutrition Force, a UK-based coalition of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow into what they can be", and a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from Citizens of the World.
With the support of UK government funders, donors, national governments, and Citizens of the World just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past, Nutrition Strength Ambassador Tracey Ullman spoke at a public event at the Live Music Festival in London in April 2018.
The mob also attacked after more than 5,000 protests calling on England to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for another campaign, the Nutrition Challenge, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition support.
In response to one of the questions asked on her website she asks "what is the point of thinking we will end extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world responded: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great struggles for civil liberty and the struggle against apartheid that came before us, we will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will be performing at this year's festival in New York, which will be headlined by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US to use Navy to "block" to prevent exit of Lost goods - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to block Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke speculated that Russia's intervention in Syria - that is, where it allegedly operated at the invitation of the recognized government - was a ploy to find new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to get energy just as they did in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he said, according to the report.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the power, with our navy, to ensure open sea routes, and, if necessary, to fund it, to ensure that their energy does not go to waste", he said.
Zinke was addressing an audience organized by the Electricity Consumers Association, a non-profit group that has been dubbed the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared it to Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, since they are similar.
"The economic stakes on Iran and Russia are, more or less, benefiting from the substitution of oil", he said, while referring to Russia as a "cradle of civilization" with an economy based on fossil fuel fuels.
The talks come at a time when the Trump administration has already begun working on a policy to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the worst choice for consumers in Europe.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw the "incorrect" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline, which according to Trump, has made Berlin and Moscow "prisoner".
Moscow further emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the current pipeline development to 110 billion cubic meters, is a genuine economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's strong opposition to the project was driven by economic factors and served as an example of a false play.
"I think we are of the opinion that energy will not be the only tool of pressure that consumers choose to supply", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US move drew a response from Germany, which confirmed the launch of the project.
The German industrial giant, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US to suspend the EU's energy policy and the cooperation agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our electricity", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will make a "good study" of running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would make a "clear assessment" of her candidacy for President after a midterm election.
During the town council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that includes women in the air", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will take a closer look at the presidential nomination.
Warren has accused President Donald Trump of misconduct in the House, saying he has misled the nation.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has long been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before the election".
Another poll result released on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren County residents do not think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters in Massachusetts say the state legislature is in the race, according to the Suffolk County Political Research Center/Boston Global Poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the petition.
The results show the strongest support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other Democratic Party figures discussed for the 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Congressman Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin launches PTSD track Palin at the meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
What my son is going through, what he is recovering from, I can relate to other families who are feeling the devastation of PTSD and some of the trauma that soldiers are recovering from, she told the crowd at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her detention "a nightmare in the room" and said that her son and other veterans, "are coming back in a different way, they have come back with a sense of humor, they are coming back with a sense of wonder if there is this honor that their fellow soldiers, both on the ground and in the air, and any other security force has given to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, involvement in a domestic violence scandal and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a Wasilla Police Department agent.
18 states, D.C. are supporting the challenge of a new asylum system
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to the new U.S. law that bans sanctuaries for terrorist and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a counter-suit Friday in Washington in support of the asylum seeker's challenge to the system, NBC reports.
full name Mai Kara in Grace v. Unresolved is a class action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal government's system of government.
She said her union partner, who had a conflict with her militant children, had abused her but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was kidnapped in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace have compared El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which supply many asylum seekers in the United States, as states with high levels of domestic terrorism.
The new asylum system reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board that allowed undocumented refugees from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a Friday announcement that the new policy "ignores decades of personal, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that any claim for asylum be adjudicated on the merits of the case, and such a ruling violates this principle", the court counsel said.
Authorities have consistently stressed that policies to prevent immigrants from entering the US economy are harmful, saying they could be entrepreneurs who "provide decent employment".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities not to offer asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, ethnicity, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Granting asylum will not solve all the problems - or all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Emergency rescue efforts in Palu as casualties mount in the race to save lives
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"He is a violent man", said his 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby at a shelter in Palu.
Ambulance is bringing in dead bodies every minute.
For the trouble purified Water.
Residents were seen rebuilding their destroyed homes, retrieving the goods from the water, trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered injuries to his back and shoulder, are resting in the back of the Palus Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the intensity of the incident.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled the tremors that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
We don't have time to run away.
I was squeezed into the rubble of the wall, I thought", Haris told the Gamammun Newspaper, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are well.
US ambassador accuses China of 'taking advantage' with 'propaganda'
A week after a Chinese newspaper used four pages a day to advertise criticism of US-China trade relations, however, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday revealed that China was paying daily subscriptions to the Des Moines Tribune - the largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after China was accused of meddling in the November 6 presidential election, an allegation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election suggests that US officials told Reuters that it was a new plan by Washington to put pressure on China.
It is normal for foreign governments to introduce trade promotion measures, with Beijing and Washington locked in a trade war effort that has brought them to revenue-gathering levels on each side.
China's initial response to the tariff in the trade war was to launch a factory strike against states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday opinion piece in the Des Moines Register, "is now cutting back on this abuse by using propaganda ads in free newspapers".
"In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government is contributing to the creation of an American culture of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by paying for advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
He added, "In the lecture halls in Beijing, you will find no noise of voices that can prevent you from understanding the different perspectives that the Chinese people face in the economic crisis, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that "one of the most influential newspapers in China has turned down the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are divided over women voters with Kavanaugh Debacle, observers warn
Many of the Republican leaders have stood firm and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as he faces allegations of sexual assault, with observers warning that they will see more violence, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood around this was high, and many Republicans were in the process of expressing their desire to continue voting.
These things cannot be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake of (R-Arizona) that the latest push of the FBI investigation could lead to voter outrage.
"Women will never forget yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the Women's Movement, said Friday, according to the Washington DC Times.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber as Republicans who oversaw the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's impeachment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the report was brought by Mic.
"The desire for democracy and empowerment will be reflected in the message", Stu Rothenberg, a political reporter, told the website.
"People say he was in heaven, that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among the women's voting groups, in rural areas and the lower voter demographic, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, will not vote".
Even before Ford's testimony became public about her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, commentators noted the potential backlash that would follow if the Republican nomination went through.
"This is a major blow to the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final election or whether Kavanaugh was put on the bench, it's about how Republicans handled this and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, director of America First, a group helping to elect Democrats, was quoted as saying by the media.
However, Americans are divided on who to believe after the disclosure of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slight majority being overwhelmingly in favor.
A new YouGov poll shows 41% of respondents doubt whether they believe Ford's claims, while 35% are certain or believe Kavanaugh's claims.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same as Ford.
After Flake's arrest, the FBI is investigating the case that Ford filed with another suspect, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh was drunk when he sexually assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the former Supreme Court Justice showed his genitals to her while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the world wide web is planning to launch a new web on the backs of google and facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is planning to launch a project that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology is being developed by Inrupt, a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Mining allows users to choose where to store data and what data access rights are granted.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to "rule the world".
"We don't have to do it now", he said about starting.
"Now is the time for history".
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online storage" or POD.
It contains contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser interface all at the same time.
The amazing thing about the self-service store in an online store is that the user has complete control over the access to such information.
The company calls it "empowerment through collected data".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring the resources, organization and convenience to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security system acquired by IBM, several other developers working on the project, and a team of young coders.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own distributed memory using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his colleagues had not consulted "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a change where all of their business models would be overnight.
"We never ask for their permission".
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and business intelligence capabilities to help protect the integrity and efficiency of the construction of the new Solid Web site".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet yet again when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Within a few months, Berners-Lee was a leading voice in the debate on the inconsistency.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee would have been the founder and executive director of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Data Center Initiative.
I have very high hopes for this revolutionary internet, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Awarded the WW1 Victoria Cross
The main Church of England parish once won the prestigious Victoria Cross during World War I and the parish celebrated its centenary in the city.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and was unaware that he had won the British Army's highest award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a bar in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it a "precious symbol" that would be revealed 100 years after receiving his grandfather's gift.
According to the London Chronicle, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very rough and very dark fog to the fire from the field with machine guns".
He then moved up to the line of fire with "the greatest of his heroes" who led the front line before firing a single shotgun and taking down three armies.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, aged 72, said that his grandfather's actions "were something I knew I could never be except something humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also put on a candle after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "I really enjoyed the little boy for his role in the play" and added that he was a great hero who was shown support and the support of the people".
MMA fans spent the night sitting down to watch Bellator 206, but then got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you sit for a night to watch Bellator 206 but only to be denied access to the actual event.
The countdown from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, spectators in the UK were left stunned when the weather changed to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were not bothered after they sat up until the early hours of the morning especially for the fights.
One fan explained on Twitter that the change to a children's cartoon was like a form of sick play.
"It is the government policy that at 6am they change the channel because the program is not suitable so they have to switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of communications and marketing, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa is dead, yes".
Bellator CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on plans to connect with British viewers in the future.
"I think if I thought about reprinting, I think it could be rich", Coker said.
"But it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning there, and we cannot do it until our Sunday time, their Monday time.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it was switched on there were messages floating back and forth and they were all pretty unpleasant.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it is not, it is a matter of government.
I assure you that it will never happen again.
Believe me, when it was replaced there were messages floating back and forth and they were all unpleasant.
It is a frustrating attitude.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'out of place' because of gender
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he grew up feeling more than anyone else because of his gender - but it's what gave him the talent to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he went to high school that he understood that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4 Desert Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of gays to give others "opportunity".
He also said that being a father made him less anxious about the Olympics.
The host of the daily program, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a different character on the first episode of Laverne, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone of any age because "it's not allowed to be in public to like boys and girls".
"Even today", he says, "the feelings of inferiority, and the feeling of something different, have been the very things that have given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he was not disappointed in anyone when they discovered his species.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a rising LGBT figure and used it at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to give gay rights.
He said that he spoke because he enjoyed being out in the open without interruption and wanted to give others "an opportunity".
The three-time world champion said that his encounter with American Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a bit of a shock".
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap was not a concern.
"If you're struggling with a lot at my age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's rare to find someone who has been in such a high position.
The couple became parents in June, to son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his future was changing.
If you asked me last year, the whole point was that I should win a gold medal, he said.
You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father couldn't believe he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets to London 2012 - since he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say that the gun will get a front row seat", he said.
I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and died before I accepted that he was human, he said.
The year before, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just know that this is something I have dreamed of all my life - to swim in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there is no better occasion than this", he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first song - Pride by Heather Small - which endured him in the Olympics and was raising a gun and a body cigar.
Desert Island Disc is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15
Tired pitcher Mickelson was dropped from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he has had to change his format to avoid disappointment in the post.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th hole, was saved by captain Jim Furyk in a four-man playoff on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the game, as is typical for the United States, the five-time champion divides his day between being motivated and working on his online game with the hope of fixing what he already has.
Not consistent in his dribbling or in his pitching, the 48-year-old is unsuited to the tight-knit Le Golf course of the Federation, where there is a height to the torture and brutal violence.
And if the game itself wasn't a match, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faced British grand champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches that week.
If the Americans, four points below the mark they would have in the opening 12 games, get up and warm up to start the game, Mickelson's play would be a crucial factor.
Furyk expressed his confidence in the man, although he could not say anything else.
"He realized the importance of it today, he hugged me back and put his arms around me, said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He was very confident.
He is one of the most popular heroes and has been highly acclaimed in this organization in the past, and this week.
I never thought it would be possible for him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's the process and that's the way we thought we were going to go.
He wanted to be out there, like everybody else".
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could bring to an end a Ryder Cup match that would never be matched at the highest level of history alone.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, though Furyk said his presence brought some important things to the team.
"He was funny, stupid, charming, liked to make fun of people, and became the biggest player in the club", he said.
"I think young players like to tease him, even, this weekend, which is interesting.
He brought much more than just a gift.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big gap will soon pass
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that getting a small gap in the final few days of the Ryder Cup men's singles event can be difficult.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points but only managed to finish the line with their wings ahead in the distance of the most read, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only", said Bjorn, who compared, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Toh Tarihi will show me and everyone in this organization that it is not over yet.
You have a full day tomorrow.
You go there and do everything right.
You don't finish this and you find the settings on the screen.
We have a goal, and it is to strive to reach that goal, and that is where we will find our enthusiasm.
I said at the beginning, I'm excited about the 12 players in our squad, but we all know what's going on on the other side - they have the world champions.
Knowing how these players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: I would never go above myself in this.
Tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow is the next step, and it's also a different thing to do.
It's nice to be with a partner when things are good, but when you go out alone, you're being tested to your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players, is to bring out your potential tomorrow.
Now, leave your friends behind because you have to bring out the talent and the personality, and the style".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk would require his players to perform with more skill than they did in the partnership, which included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points.
Furyk himself was on the fringes of these recent super-groups, having been one of the players who won the tournament at Brookline before they went on to lose as Europeans pulled off the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every bad word", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had put his players together until the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but then you start coming up as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When stress enters one direction, it puts tremendous pressure on these core muscles.
We set our standards accordingly and we make people feel the way we want to, you know, we're trying to make a surprise tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try to lead Rory McIlroy in the top flight with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half in the same structure.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I thought it was covering the whole way", Bjorn recalls of his choices.
The new German battleship was delayed again
The new German Navy ship was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships. but it will not be until at least next year due to structural errors and high cost of ice, media reports reported.
The inauguration of Rheinland-Pfalz, which leads the new state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now suspended until the first half of 2019, a statement by Die Zeit said.
The ship was due to enter the Navy in 2014, but problems with the delivery delayed the project's completion.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates delivered by the Navy in 2007 will come as a replacement for the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will include a powerful fire station, an air and naval warfare array and other advanced technology, such as radar, infrared and sonar sensing.
Other key features include a longer period of development - new frigates should be deployed up to two years from home ports.
However, the further delay indicates the effectiveness of the warship - which would allow Germany to maintain a high level of combat power over the sea - will be out of fashion by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 Frigate became headlines last year, when German naval officials refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss warehouse in Hamburg.
The idea was to raise awareness that the Navy would return the ship to its builder after it had arrived.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media reported on "mistakes and errors" that rendered the warship unusable if deployed in combat operations.
The Mannheim class was of significant importance as they were operated by a crew of 120 Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates.
It also stated that the ship had a heavy hull which reduced its performance and limited the naval capability for future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to have "the same weight as the German submarines of the same type used in World War II.
In addition to the inadequate equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the workers - is a major concern.
The estimated cost was said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates became more critical in the light of recent warnings that German naval power was declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief of the German security committee, admitted that the real ship was "the submarine that first left during the launch of the right-wing aircraft".
The official said the problem was solved in time, as the older ships were stopped but the new ones were not delivered.
He was disappointed that none of the people from Baden-Wuerttemberg had ever boarded the ship.
The secret life of the insect
New research being conducted in a part of the Scottish Highlands aims to explain how bats use space in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of the study will provide new insight into the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research by scientists at the Scottish Trust for Nature Conservation will follow the browning and soprano pipistrelles with the brown and long-eared Daubenton's crow in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special scanner will be placed on a separate surface around the product to monitor the presence of the bats in all the packages.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile phone screenings using handheld scans.
The sound results from experts of all vocal systems can help to determine the number of calls bats make and what each species does.
Custom maps and reports will be produced to create a more in-depth picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a climate consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas are most important to the butterfly and how they use each.
This information will help determine the use of local management functions such as resource allocation and how best to manage the forest for bats and other similar species.
The number of lepers in Scotland and other parts of Bithynia has dropped dramatically in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat.
Wind and electricity can cause accidents, as can newspaper and other building chemical agents, and attacks by domestic animals.
The fact is that the mattress is not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated system to listen for sounds and locate insects and other obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 greenhouses, 38 useful gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is a critical supplier of bats and batsmen.
He had ten children, was a frequent explorer, a collector of hermitages and an occasional rescuer.
The industry has also opened the first single-breeding stud farm in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfires and Galloway, which has 8 of Scotland's 10 breeding packs.
Property manager David Thompson said the property is the most suitable for the area.
"Here in Threave we have a good area for the parishes", he said.
We had old houses, old logs and a nice cabin.
But there is much about the seeds that is unknown, so our work on this treasure will help us to identify some of the things that they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of getting the bird before the property is taken care of as it is possible that the destruction of the women's collection could lead to the death of up to 400 wives and children, which could possibly wipe out the local bird population.
The congregation is protected so that it is not illegal to kill them, disturb their peace or concern them or demolish their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrel, Scotland's Director of the Department of Conservation, called for people to come together to help.
She said: We have a lot to learn about the eagles and their many species of eggs we do not know how many are in the state.
Ronaldo denied the allegations of rape while his lawyers were preparing to file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which had published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the matter, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking through an Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the alleged footage was taken, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the footage as "fake news".
I'm not going to do it.
What they said today, the story is fake, the fifth Ballon dOr winner said in the camera.
They wanted to promote themselves by using my name.
That is correct.
They wanted to make a name for themselves by mentioning my name, but he was in the process.
"I am a calm person and everything is fine", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's defense lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "reported without evidence on the allegations by the private sector", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would be seeking a fine for the loss of his moral character, in an amount commensurate with the severity of the crime, which could be the most serious human rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a hotel room of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the actor's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo fell on his knees afterwards and told her that the 99% is a good person who gets a kick out of the 1%.
Their documents state that Ronaldo believed that they had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also confessed that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later settled out of court because she was afraid of reprisals and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old is now looking to turn the tables as she continues to face the brunt of the recession.
Ronaldo was returning to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and had just returned to top Italian club Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever be without carmakers
The UK will be forever in the dark if it loses its leadership role in the automotive industry after Brexit, Secretary of State Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily sell work at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr Clark said.
Japanese car company says the impact of delays at the border in the event of no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which combines the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of Europe.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a buy call in our industry", said Mavin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a clear understanding of how cross-border business will be, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its small Oxford factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what the automakers say about the risk of getting the equipment if there is no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production process is based on a 'part-time' system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers across the UK and EU of vehicles called 'series'.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems which the industry says could lead to delays and disruption.
Toyota cannot keep more than a day's worth of equipment at its Derbyshire factory, the company says, so the work will be expensive.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's policy of opposing the EU was originally designed to avoid such investigations.
"We need to get a deal. We want to get a better deal that gives us the right as I said not only to win the game we are enjoying right now but to take advantage of that opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The argument not only for Toyota but also for other brands is that we have a fundamental need to continue to be what we are about to become.
Toyota has failed to predict how long the work will be sold, but in the longer term, they warn that the price will reduce the competitiveness of the industry and that this will lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the spokesman for the union in the factory, said its members are continuing to worry: "In my experience once these jobs are gone they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have submitted a fair and transparent framework for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "remain on hold for another week" as the battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueler, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's staff and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether or not Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, thereby putting Mueller's freedom at risk, has been a topic of controversy in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a phone conversation to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of the President being removed legally on the 25th.
Rosenstein denied the photo.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in a report that he would be welcomed.
Instead, his meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, which further delayed the Congressional elections.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "We don't have a date yet, it could be this weekend, I think it could be a week later based on all the things going on in the High Court.
But we will see and we will continue to inform the press".
Some journalists will dispute this explanation: Sanders has not held a speech at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the failure to make the speech was not due to the problem of the TV audience, "although she said: 'I'm not going to deny the fact that they are important.'
She then suggested seeing Trump in person which would increase the media's exposure.
"The president has done more Q&A in peace than any president before him", she said, without pointing to evidence: "We looked at these numbers".
The speech will still go on, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions, it's better to do it in person than to talk to me.
We've tried to do that very hard and you've seen us do that very hard in the last few weeks and this will happen in a very brief speech when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends a press conference or a press conference with visiting guests.
Concealed press speeches are difficult.
In New York City this week, the president explained why he is taking advantage of his privilege and coming up with some amazing moments before he convenes the press.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working for Scotland's NHS to express gratitude to the country and their desire to stay after-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made efforts to meet the cost of living requirements for EU citizens working in the public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to this grand decision.
But the British Government continued to prepare for the possibility of a disaster.
I know this must be a time of great uneasiness for you all.
That is why I want to emphasize again how much each employee is valued in his contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Partners from across the EU, and beyond, are providing valuable expertise to strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is a perfect home and we would like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Organic of Tennessee brought the re-photon.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
He went straight to the sideline and there he fell, Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on the bench and returning him for further evaluation.
Officials from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no detailed information on the nature/frequency of the injuries" and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with the Tennessee Titans after transferring from Illinois.
He had five shots on Saturday before dropping out of the game, which brought his age to 18 shots.
Buyers of cross-border properties will be charged the highest stamp duty if they buy properties in the UK
Overseas buyers will be charged higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK with extra cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
This move would undermine Corbyn's victory to attract younger voters
The stamp act will have an impact on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The fund expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Overseas buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty if they buy property in Britain - with more money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to derail Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters with promises to provide affordable housing and to introduce stricter measures.
The stamp duty would rise against individuals and companies failing to pay taxes in the UK, with additional funds supporting the government by tackling insomnia.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including measures introduced in the last two years on two houses and a lease purchase - could be as much as three percent.
The fund expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that around 13% of new London building materials are purchased from foreign residents in Britain, and the cost of building is making it difficult for first-time buyers to gain access to housing.
Many of the country's wealthier areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time away from home.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp stamp drive to help young people who own their homes.
He accused the major Building Companies of storing expensive properties by taking land without using it, and urged Mrs May to leave the income on the houses to address "the housing crisis in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a package of planned housing reforms, including a rent scheme and an end to the export tax.
He also wanted to give the legislature the power to create new buildings.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate the empire to restoring the British dream - that life is better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the collapsed mall buildings.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for people not living in the UK, and foreign companies, to buy homes as it is for British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home seems far removed, and the insensitivity of a bad night's sleep adds to the certainty of reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to run Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his "goal" is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The Scot, 42, is excited to challenge the return of the North-East club, who currently sit third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Brighton Stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish top flight.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B hat and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's The Voice.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and he had something going on.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in running the organization".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic chairman says he is not afraid of what these names have set in such a big club, after wartime offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The big question for me at that time was 'can I get the team back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and equipment in this organization, it is not surprising that we belong to the Freemasonry", he said.
"It was not easy to get it there, but I can see myself as having success here if I can get the team there".
Ross's only three years in management was a short-lived one, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts' sporting management academy.
He also helped Alloa's relegation to the third division, and re-converted St Mirren from its Championship role the following season.
And Ross said he feels better than he ever did when playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"He became very confused", he recalled, and accepted the Alloa's proposal.
"I really believed that management was better for me, than playing.
It's amazing because I've tried, I've made a good living out of it, and I've enjoyed some glory.
But playing can be challenging.
Each week you will encounter a variety of situations.
I still have this issue with the problems and pressure of the project but the management feels fine.
I always wanted to do it, and now I do it, and I feel so good about being in the circus all my life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, the study shows
The heat wave has boosted access to competing British resorts but has added pressure on restaurants.
Parks and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while restaurants were down 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, the CGA's business manager, who included the figures, said: "It continued to shine with England outperforming the World Cup in July, which followed a similar trend to the previous June, when it gained 2.8 per cent, but most restaurants were much lower.
The 1.8 percent drop in retail food sales in June alone was worse in July.
The bars and pubs have become more powerful with their variety than the restaurants that were at the bottom.
The food stalls also suffered during the day, but not as much as the restaurant staff.
It seems that people were out to get a drink.
In all the places where the drinking and liquor sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, food was less than a third".
Paul Newman, a park analyst and RSM scholar said: "These results have been consistent since late April.
The nature and impact of major social or sporting events have been major factors when it comes to selling in the local market.
It is no wonder that restaurant organizations are continuing to struggle, to prevent the drop to 4.8 percent per year as it would be a severe blow on the cost pressures being faced.
The long heat wave could not have come at a worse time for food processors like this and the time would have fallen more than the maximum temperature we experienced in August would have provided the necessary delay".
Total sales revenue across bars and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the company's output.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Marketplace tracks UK businesses, the bar and restaurant sector collecting and analysing economic data from 47 active organisations, with a turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark database.
One in five children has a personal website that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a private website that they keep hidden from their parents and teachers, research shows
Survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in fake Instagram
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published
20% of students say they have a website that shows parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has created an adult-friendly website.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren shows the rapid rise of fake Instagram accounts - references and sharing of photos on the social networking site Instagram.
The news further honored the fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the children said they use the "basic" clean page to show parents, while they have a private one.
A mother who accessed her 13-year-old daughter's private website found a young girl begging others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them confident that they have a personal profile.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that many young people are eager to open websites where their parents and teachers will not find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Football Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Authority board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the best all-round runner and Scotland's other field athlete and manager Ian Beattie has described this as a very promising position for those who are leading the sport to have the opportunity to use it at an international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected among the Scottish, British and international sporting community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her to the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in doing voice work for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games in a total of four Olympic medals and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after suffering a short bout of anemia.
He wrote on Twitter: Today is the day a month ago that I lost my life.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a grueling operation but he made a full recovery, learned how to walk again and today he is doing a ton of exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A breast tattoo advertisement comparing mothers to cows has sparked controversy online
A breastfeeding company has shared an online ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being suckled.
To mark the launch of what is being touted as "the world's first breast-worn tattoo device", tech company Elvie released a colorful music video ad to showcase the freedom the new faucet offers mothers.
The mothers danced in a full circle to songs that included the phrases: "Yes, I'm a headless woman, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice, these are not tits, these are my breasts".
"Touch it, touch it, I'm feeding the children, touch it, touch it, I'm nursing the mother", the mother continued.
However, the ad, which was published on the company's website, caused controversy on the Internet.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many comments pointing to the "disgusting" nature of the dairy industry.
It is a bad idea to use cows to promote this product.
Like us they should be pregnant and give birth for milk production, only their young are stolen from their mother's womb after birth", someone wrote.

Another says:  There is often tension between mother and baby.
But why not use a breast pump ad for parents who want to save their baby?
another added: The numbers don't make sense.
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "soothing".
"I thought that was a good suggestion.
I bought one and I'm still breastfeeding it.
I know the machine like a cow.
The truth is a little crazy but I took it as it was.
"I think this is a good advice", someone wrote.
Another said: the hotel is a purposeful entertainment for women who are busy (especially at work or in the bathroom) and feel like channas.
this is not a promotional or a milk company advertisement.
At the end of the video the women's group shows that they are dancing wearing a pumpkin on their breast.
The campaign's theme is about the research that women who suck their breasts feel like they're sucking.
Elvie's bottle however, lacks a spout, no wires or soap and fits into a breast-feeding bottle, allowing women to move freely, hold babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner with ECD and a parent commented: The Elvie phone is a revolutionary product that is suitable for aggressive and aggressive presentation.
By drawing a line between the depiction of women and cows we put the breast tattoo and all the challenges in the spotlight, while showing in a more dramatic way and how it can be shown that freedom and a new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has made headlines.

Hundreds of refugee children made their way quietly to a sheltered camp on the Texas border
The number of child migrants being detained has increased although the monthly border connections have remained unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's disapproval of the policy has made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were illegal immigrants, and they feared to establish their own right to stay in the country by continuing to demand children.
The danger increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other local residents would hand in their handprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the House that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who have support or domestic support are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals.
So we are continuing to follow these people", said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the process of executing children, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, instead of after 60 days, which is the previous standard, according to process staff.
Many will come out via video conference call, rather than in person, to be transported about the trial, as a judge.
Those deemed unworthy of help we will return.
Most of their children are in foster care, most of whom would be traumatized or shaken, which can lead to violence or escape attempts, according to the system's staff and reports that have emerged from the system's recent investigations.
Advocates say that the impact is more concerning in large homes like Tornillo's, where signs that a child is struggling are easily overlooked, due to its size.
They added that sending children back to the tent city without enough time to prepare their minds or to say goodbye could exacerbate the depression that many of them suffer from.
Sham told the US occupation forces, France and Turkey to withdraw without delay
In a speech to the United Nations, Foreign Minister al-Moualem called for refugees to return home, despite the country's ongoing war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the country's military was there illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw without delay and unconditionally", he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism is almost over in Sham, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, with millions more left homeless.
He said that Damascus will continue the war until all areas of Shamash are cleared of all terrorist groups and all officials who are here without permission.
The US has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the situation has improved for the refugees to return, and he blamed the Western countries for "unfair fear" that the refugees have refused to return.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return, he said.
They are political and it is a matter of personal feelings.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the reconstruction of Syria until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the war.
UN officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to separate the mountains from the last major rebel-held area in Idlib provides a window on further political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ended the massive invasion of the Russian-backed Shams into the province, home to three million people.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had a clear timeline and expressed hope that the military action would focus on the terrorists along with fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be dealt with.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of the committee which consists of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution after the Sham War and open the way to elections.
Moualem has issued conditions for the participation of the Sham government in the commission, saying that the work of the bodies should be limited to reviewing the laws of the current regime, and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this strategy, Mr. Trump would win re-election to a second term in 2020 unless, as many members of the Liberal Party expect, impeachment and impeachment ends his presidency prematurely.
In what no argument will be the most amazing end of leadership ever!
Meanwhile, there is no sign of the viewer's exhaustion.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have jumped more than two times to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in its first season, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow's "Home" dominated cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the congressional secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Only a Few Parts of the Story: Some Unfortunate Reflections on the Swinging Into the Hollywood Male Club", has a different take.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Which one?" she asked.
"Why, because it makes me laugh", Mr. Scovell told us.
There is value in entertainment in a chaotic world.
Yes, unlike anything on television, news stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or whether refugees can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
The Exodus was a privilege only for a select few.
And yet, it's more than being a celebrity citizen if you find yourself in six hours of watching a panel of experts discuss the use of "deep data" by Bob Woodward in his quest for his book "Scarecrow", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket (a thick and expensive piece of clothing, the Washington Post says) and the significance of the sketch, um, Mr. Trump's body by Stormy Daniel.
I, in particular, will no longer watch Super Mario as I used to.
"One of the things that makes it look like a game is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Mongomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's game-changing strategy (battle of the N.F.L, and praise of Kim Jong-un).
You would not want to miss any bones or be left behind.
When I found Mr. Fleiss this weekend, it was sunny to 80 degrees outside his home on the north side of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't pull himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing the House Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we used to do jokes back in the day that people said, "that's the beauty of education"," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out to be the truth.

Foreign currency filled the most recent midterm parliamentary elections
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a lot of money, thanks to the congressional district redistricting that brought two senators into the race for the same seat.
This new set of districts outside of Pittsburgh includes Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb - who won the seat in a district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running with another Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's former 12th District, which closely aligns with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the boundaries of the old unincorporated communities were merged in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th opened the way for a financial competition between the major party funders, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely watched March 18 Pennsylvania State Assembly primary.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political elites gave the Democratic Party a limited success.
US to review El Salvador's sentence in favor of China, and then fail
Officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already signed with Beijing, with a small contingent from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was a hotel owner in Panama until Trump's business associates fired the management of the organization.
National officials have decided to reinstate senior US diplomatic staff in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decision to cease serving Taiwan, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only nine were studied in El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development support and economic aid.
The study's findings, which include cuts in funding and restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country that is suffering from unemployment and mass murder.
While the internal meeting was going on, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level meeting on security and economic stability to mark the end of last year's meeting which was seen as an attempt to deter immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking government officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to continue, thus ending the sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to deliver remarks at the summit, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of bringing government activities to the table, the ambassador said.
And three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the full debate as disclosed by three US officials, including two diplomatic staff, who agreed to discuss it in private.
Their information was confirmed by an analyst who was close to the government and spoke in an undercover manner.
Read the History
The next shoe to drop could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible impeachment, which is now the subject of much debate in the public record.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his attention to finding out whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the House of Representatives votes against him, Mr. Trump will find himself accused of taking responsibility for the coalition, as he prepares to return to the electorate, and the ballot box is among his supporters.
There are many question marks, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is impossible - just that he's a European failure.
There is a choice to be made with all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight can go on.
In 1938, German officials planned a coup against Hitler, if the West rejected him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the chance to avoid the decades of bloodshed that followed.
The historical record warns of such a problem, and democracy is necessarily implemented without haste or delay.
Americans have experienced much of this machine fatigue now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported that, last year, he had secretly advised the president and considered his disqualification for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times account was inaccurate.
"What do we say if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unreliable - or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite multiple allegations of sexual abuse and flawed evidence?
And in all, are we going to vote in the middle for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I have the confidence that we will not fall, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovak who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a candlestick on a table with a swastika.
With this as my legacy, how can I be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is confident ahead of the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over the Austrians, after scoring against Spain's Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a youngster towards bigger things.
"This is a good score for us because Villarreal is good", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with the belief that we could win something and we survived by one point
We might have eaten them at the end but, on the whole, the horse's ear is probably a good result.
They were the best in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best side.
Thursday night was a big night in Europe.
We are hopeful, we can get three points but that will be a tough challenge because they have a good result in the final but, with our crowd of fans, I am sure we can push for a better result.
Last year was tough, between the incident and my injuries and the changes in the organization but now there are signs of relief there now.
The sewing is good and the children are enjoying it; the exercise is good.
Hopefully, we can push now, put last season behind us and win".
Women are losing sleep for fear of losing their retirement savings
While the participants in their survey had their own ideas about how they would like to be treated, few of the people talked about it with their peers.
Nearly half of the people in a nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about money that has been withheld for a long time.
Only 10 percent have talked to their siblings about it.
"People want family to care for them, but they don't take the initiative to talk", said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Insurance Commission.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellors and your family to discuss who will be cared for, for these decisions are important to determine the cost.
Get a financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Choosing your long-term care insurance coverage can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a matching financial need insurance policy to help cover those costs or self-insurance and your own cost - taking into account the cost of the policy.
Bring your case files: Kill legal battles in the past.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted health care professional and to make sure that your needs are being met even if you are unable to speak.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your money.
You appoint one person you agree to make decisions about your finances and make sure that the fees are paid even if you cannot afford them.
consider the details: Imagine that an elderly parent has a serious illness and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and disease?
Write these details in clear, well-drawn-out notes so that you can prepare.
"It's not just about money, but about the stupid doctors?" Martin asked.
What is the cure?
Who will take care of the dog?

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with more casualties expected.
Due to the lack of communication, security officials have not received any information from Donggala regency, an area in northern Palu that was most affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster began.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a chain of more than 300 miles (180 km) of coastline along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The constituency, a national electoral district in the province, elected approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
agriculture are the main economic activity of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the southern tip of Sulawesi.
Paman and Donggala have experienced a series of tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck the western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the mountains of the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes are frequent.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December 2004 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes struck the western part of the island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that penetrated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 metres in height that destroyed several small towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing an uproar and panic as reminders of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami are raised.
No tsunami was recorded, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A massive earthquake hits the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a temporary state of shock.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the chief of staff of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on suspicion of abuse.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, with access to domestic violence reports, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone from her car.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, in fact" when questioned, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class I felony counts, meaning he could be incarcerated for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time Palin was charged with a serious crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with the murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, disorderly conduct and reporting on domestic terrorism, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in the case by veteran's groups in 2016 after it was linked to her family's attitudes to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds have died
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications have been cut off with more deaths expected in the coming days.
The quake started just outside the central Sulawesi in the northeast of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video that has been circulating on social media sites shows the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach celebration in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for the NYC terrorist
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City bombing, which killed eight people - the worst conviction for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used home-made vehicles to carry out attacks on the motorway and along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, targeting pedestrians and bicycles in his driveway in October.
To secure the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "unintentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty motion, filed in the Southern District of New York.
All of the above were guilty of capital murder, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder for malicious assistance, mostly by prosecutors in organized crime, and charges of rioting and vandalism.
The attack required "significant and thorough investigation and prosecution", prosecutors said, explaining Saipov's characterization of him as "vicious, vicious and ruthless".
"The death of Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, illness, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent states. The death of the victim was ruled a homicide by the police.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York introduced the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The latter was when the federal death penalty was imposed in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple after being convicted of conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, displayed a ruthless attitude in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had received a confession after carrying out the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also demanded that an Isis flag be displayed in the hospital's ward, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal civil rights advocates in Saipov state, said they had "moderation" with the decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the convict's sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole would overcome the problems that are common to all", Patton said.
Lawyers for Saipov's defense have asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be treated for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to rebel today during a protest at a Tory rally.
The former Ukip leader says politicians have 'felt the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's representatives suggested she should consider negotiating with the EU.
A recent supporter, Peter Bone, told reporters in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the EU if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges Mrs May faced in the reconciliation process and the divisions between the various parties that were created suggest that the Pro-Remain Tories are entering the anti-Brexit fray in the city.
Freeman has been struggling with management issues and her analysts have been preparing for a run on the road amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Friends insisted that she push ahead with her efforts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the consequences - and force the Europeans and Labour to choose between her and 'the rednecks'.
Mr Bone told AFP news agency that he wanted to 'see' the 'Investigators'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be a candidate and put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were a caregiver, we would have been out by now", he says.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand by Brexit but we need to look at the regulators.'
Speaking against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to be the elites.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be wrong is wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was on the trip, reporting: "I'm just saying: The Prime Minister listened to the people.
'The investigators are not as tough with the public, the Opposition would not vote, without our party and our activists, who have corrupted the streets and made us vote from the beginning.
Please download Search and start listening.'
In a message directed at Mrs May, she added: 'Ministers can only continue their work if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told politicians that politicians must first 'feel the heat' if they want to win the fraudulent 2016 referendum.
'This is now about the issue of how we - the people - and the politicians', he said.
'They are trying to manipulate Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go without doing so'.
In a message to the cheering crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pain.
'We are assembling the forces of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are independent, sovereign, and proud of Britain.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers toured Birmingham before a two-hour round-trip around the city centre.
The radical activist raised the Tories' objection to Brexit after the party was launched over the holidays.
Labour's Lord Adonis blasted the Conservatives over the security problems they have experienced with party applications during the opening of the event.
"These are the people who told us that they can have the IT infrastructure in one place and all the technology in Canada, for a borderless, for a free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
'It is a complete sleep.
There is nothing as good as Brexit, he added.
Warren will make a "good study" of the Presidential candidacy
US Sen. Elizaberth said she would make a "significant review of the Presidential candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican GOP Senator Geoff Diehl, who was the chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's rally in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of the city council since Trump took office.
A delegate asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to reform our government and that includes the women above,
Arrested in the LSU Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at a news conference ET.
They released the video shoot on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul said Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being there, armed with a handgun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident, and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge police station.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Cup when the fans give him a chance to beat Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' players will play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well and nearly hung Hamilton to dry while defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack the opponent.
Vettel entered the first pit stop and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the tail of the pack, a move that should have been a decisive factor.
Mercedes crossed the line from behind and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a head-on collision with a Ferrari driver who had unintentionally let him into good condition to hold on behind two attempts to secure the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in the seventh after the first round finish on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race while holding the lead to reach the final fastest and get a win over Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He then entered the field in the 44th but was unable to add to his strength in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen came fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had worked well all weekend and was so kind as to tell me.
The team did a great job and won the first two, according to Hamilton.
This is a bad sign
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her allegation that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court Justice-elect Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a parade in West Virginia, the president cited Ford's address to the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than saying that what was happening in the Senate had shown that the people were "deceitful liars".
"One thing that can happen and is a good thing is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when they saw anger, when they saw people who are angry and stubborn and liars who are not honest", he said.
If you look at the latest news and releases and you say, I didn't do it.
I'm not a cop.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember her response... did you pull out that paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I did not.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we export... No, we did not export", he added, as the senator pointed out.
A letter containing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein from Ford in July, and the document came out in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegation that it had come out of the document office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Zargin, I didn't disclose her story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it a secret and keep it a secret like she told me".
But her refusal did not seem to have any effect on the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you something, that's a terrible sign.
Maybe not, but this is the worst tattoo I've ever seen".
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to further their demands.
They are ready to seize power at any cost.
You see the cruelty, the lack of respect, they don't care about those who have been hurt, who will hurt to gain power and power, Mediaite reported the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants also
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars took revenge for their Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were the first team to score two goals through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the game before Dwyer again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the winner against Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals became their victory.
It was the third time the Elite League Cup had been lost to the Adam Keefe-based side, who later beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth win of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer's opening quarter came in the fourth inning on a 3:35 assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford providing the assist and Beauvillier doubling the lead to two four minutes ahead.
The game was tied from the start, with Sullivan returning the game to the house at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the assistant winner of the Cownie's Horse of the Year at 15:16.
Dwyer proved that the Giants led the game early in the period by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the period.
The opposing team changed their style and Buchard again challenged them with a hardball game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to give Dundee its first-ever lead in the final two games and secure the team's fifth-place finish in the final game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure the lives of people on board plane escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously hailed as a hero for ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off from the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and hundreds were missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Minor earthquakes continued to plague the area, and many people were in turmoil in Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his job at the construction of a tower at Maniara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He further confirmed that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was attempting to take off at the time, had safely landed.
He jumps off the tower building when he thinks he's going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a large hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost him that morning before the first plane to Palu.
"Our hearts were racing with excitement", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster management agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll could rise since many bodies are under the wreckage while more are yet to be found", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the group.
A water wave of about six meters damaged Palu whose remains will be interred at the same place on Sunday.
Military planes and chartered planes brought in relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulance is bringing in dead bodies every minute.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small businesses are being seized everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is coming quickly to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
That's sad, but it can be better".
Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I command you all to work day and night to complete all the export-related projects.
Are you ready? reported CNN.
Earlier that year, an earthquake struck Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini plane crash says one person is missing after plane crash
An airline operating a plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now reported one person missing, after it said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to give a description of one male.
The airline said they were working with authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as age or age
Traditional boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane sank while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were admitted to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remained a mystery.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane landed in the river's mouth due to a lack of a runway.
Some witnesses assumed that the ship had run aground.
American pilot Bill Jaynes said the plane came in too low.
"That was a good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to walk through the deep water to open the emergency door to the sinking ship.
The flight crew was confused by the screams, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the ship's crew were working nearby to improve the harbor and assisted with the rescue by using airboats to transport people to shore before the ship sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Centre shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Investigators uncovered the camp during the night the woman was burned alive
The judge suspended his trial on Saturday when he handed down the sentence to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
United States Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett gave hours of testimony as an expert eyewitness in the investigation.
He told the jury how he used voice phone recording to track 29-year-old criminal Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the day of her death, contradicting previous allegations, according to the Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford had a car accident on Saturday and admitted that he had been out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because the car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for almost two weeks before her death.
The phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
His defense will be heard on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be presented to the jury later that day.
Rap: What is hip hop?
A hip hop trio wanted to challenge the negative stereotypes of the genre by infusing music with positive messages.
Rapid Genre, from Bristol, claimed that hip hop left him with a strong political message and a solution to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make a hip hop hit that will restore their reputation.
Artists like the Fugees and Common saw a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and LowKey.
A black one?!
NY nanny reprimands couple for eviction after "racist" post
New York child care worker sues couple for unlawful eviction after unsolicited text from mother complaining she is "another black woman"
The couple denied that they were racist, that the case was related to homosexuality
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two younger siblings, expressed her concern when it was discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black from the moment she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"I'm not going to be able to do this", she wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman's "discomfort" fired Ms. Maurice, revealing that her former employee, who is African-American, had performed poorly and was expecting to be brought in as a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid her one-day's salary and sent home by uber.
Meanwhile, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her pregnancy, and is seeking a payment of $350 a day for six months, as was the rent for the work she was hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, there's no such thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's racist".
The couple replied that we were not showing any signs of racism, that they were doing the right thing by firing Maurice, because they were afraid that she would not trust them after they had committed the crime.
My wife also sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
It is not racist.
We are not racists, " the actor Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been guilty of, even if it's a mistake?
A newborn baby?
That's right.
He described the case as "a fraud", Plasco said his wife was pregnant with a baby that was less than two months old and was therefore in "a difficult situation".
"Would you support such a thing?
This is not a good thing", said the investment banker.
While the trial was in progress, the court of public opinion quickly caught the couple on the media's radar, criticizing them for their behavior and the system.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not want to be associated with a talking puppet, a new letter reported.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It is good to know now what we know about Paddington's great victory".
Noting that her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write a children's book by a doll, had been unaware of the book's plot, she added that the book's 60th anniversary was "difficult and exciting" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who she describes as "an important part of our family", she said that her father was proud of his great achievement.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud", she said.
"But because Paddington was so honest with him, he said that it was your son who had achieved a great success: you would be proud of them even though it was not.
I think he saw the success Paddington was having, in that way.
Although he was his own creation and thought, he always revered Paddington himself".
Her daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
They rushed her daughter to the Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"I called Nad repeatedly to say that he was very sick, that he would not be able to get up", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
"Come on, my dear", I said.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication that doctors had prescribed to keep her heart beating, gradually weakened her heart and stopped working.
She died a few times before now and that's all that covers it.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was going to be fine.
Surrounded by brothers and people, I could not cry or shout.
I tried my best to keep calm.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still reeling from the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the tragedy she was in.
No one knows, it's a lie.
I lay my head on the floor, and I cried all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but it was on the train that I began to feel a great empathy for Nad.
Wai needs my love and understanding.
Below is how much he loves her.
Women of the guild send cards to stop their killers on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide found themselves working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were painting postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call to support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first suffered from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I didn't want any parent to feel the way I felt every day", she says.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a donor with a history of pain.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They often say that his smile lights up any room.
Yet, he left that position before his death, while "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the only one to find his brother dead after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continue to worry that there is a possibility of a strike on the silk".
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't be silent - you should speak.
Ms Humphreys, who had been an only child to Ms Davies for many years, lost Mark, her friend of 15 years, following the recent death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was unwell or depressed or anything", she said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the base of the mountain on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he refused to make eye contact with them,
She says that his death is a big problem for them, but they have to work through it: "He leaves a hole in the family.
It has upset us.
But we have to keep living and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's existence is hanging in the air, as the FBI starts investigating
"I think, if we can get something like what he's looking for - just a short-term, limited-time survey - how can we bring a little bit of unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "split apart" because of the political divide.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dislike is due to time.
The midterm elections are five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans don't make a big push, then they will be hit hard in their bid to tie up the person they want to nominate to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush was on the phone calling Senators, begging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI produces a report?
Elections will be held for the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It remains unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn the offer and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of retirees in North Korea 'drops' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean policy analyst said.
Park Byeong-seug, who provided data from the Ministry of Southern Cooperation, said there were 1,127 fewer resignations last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said increased border security between North Korea and China and the rising cost of smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any comment in the past.
Most of the North Korean retirees are awarded South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people have fled China, which shares a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the renegades as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and therefore returns them.
Relations in the North and South - which were still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks related to the nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after the historic June summit between US presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to a deal that would lead to the country's denuclearization.
Following the June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to sign an agreement to use the northeastern Republic of Congo.
"Without the trust of the United States, we cannot trust our security, and in such circumstances, there is no way to destroy our weapons and ourselves", Mr Ri said in his speech to the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying he was "not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune concert in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman ever did something like that, they would say 'ridiculous,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has compassionately denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both children.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh displayed his extreme compassion, at times almost screaming and shaking while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also publicly criticized the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the charges against him "a terrorist attack, a moral panic", orchestrated by rebels, angered that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he was discriminating against Democrats.
"I think he has shown his incompetence with these remarks and the way he has followed the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was evasive when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is the Supreme Court not qualified, but the court is now", Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible ruling of Kavanaugh on the Glass-Steagall Act or Roe v. Wade, as the ruling was being made by a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh asked some questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for jokes, who do not want to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's not amazing,'" Pelos said.
And Women Need to Use It.
He had a righteous temper, months and years of anger passed, and he could not get rid of it, without crying.
We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's pretty, you know?"
She continued, "I got help from a boss in another household, who said she cries when she's angry, but she went on to use a technique that means when she's angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
Then she continued on her way.
And I thought that was a good thing".
The ball came out due to a misunderstanding in the offing.
One of the most memorable moments from my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with unbridled rage, was when an elderly woman - then the humble boss I had always suspected - leapt up the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know how angry you are.
They'll think you're sad and they'll be glad they found you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a sexual encounter in a monkey business and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, stating that there was no reason to forbid the extension of her idea and that she should run for president herself.
"It was a bad idea", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and what they needed was someone.
One called him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he was late in the campaign, she was behind on the money, so she promised that she would not run unless she collected $2 million.
This is a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her fans had given $1,000 to men who would have given her only $250.
"Do you think I'm better?" she asks.
When she presented her speech that she would not launch a campaign, she said in a tone of sympathy - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that came with the difficulty of funding and electing voters instead of representatives, and anger at the gender - that she was satisfied with that.
"You'd think I had a mental breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalls of how the journalists pressed her.
"You would think Kleenex was a weightlifter.
I remember thinking, who are they going to put on my grave?
Are you crying?
How the US-China trade war could be a boon for Beijing
The prospect of starting a trade war between the US and China is strong, and the current tensions are not stagnant, between the two countries and could be a boon for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
Donald Trump, the US president, first warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including rubber, steel and palm oil.
The biggest increase this week was a tariff that hit $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, enough to cover one-fifth of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in a variety of ways, most recently raising tariffs from five percent to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to use the US's "shoot me, shoot you" strategy, and the world's two largest economies are not preparing for a nuclear war anytime soon.
To withdraw Washington also means withdrawing in the search, but to withdraw the US publicly would be more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the US could support China in the long run by reducing its economic dependence.
"The fact that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would weaken the economy in any country is more dangerous than observers previously believed", said Abigail Grace, a researcher with the Asia Center, a think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who have volunteered to return and are pleading for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of civil war.
Speaking to the World Economic Forum, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
He said, "Today the situation in the country has become more stable and stable thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government has continued to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore order.
All the conditions are now in place for the return of the refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily life and their environment.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the civil war began in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants of the country need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any support or assistance from countries that supported the violence.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup and defeated the USA team in the 2018 final which ended with a 16.5 to 10.5 score at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight to the European nation and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown with Danish skipper Thomas Bjorn scoring 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had been the game's best pitcher, threw a par-3 in the water on the 16th hole, where he was outplayed by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all the ties, becoming the first 1-of-4 player to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth came out on 5&4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's leading scorer, fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who played in the final Ryder Cup.
A former Ryder Cup eight-time winner, Serbia Garcia became the all-time leading scorer of the European Cup with 25.5 points.
I don't cry much but today I can't hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas took me and accepted me.
I am happy, very happy to have my cup back.
It's about the organization., And I'm glad I could help", Garcia said in a sentimental mood after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who opened the US Open Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in Sunday's singles match.
My biggest pride, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record for career Ryder Cup records.
An incredible statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 trophies second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled over the weekend to find better ways to go without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a great game of golf in both games.
Captain America Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing game for his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put the heat on Europe.
We are wiped.
My regards to Thomas.
He is the captain of the ship.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll be back together, I'll be working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 and am proud to serve as captain.
You have to put on your hat.
