Rapid increase in the cumulated incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
From Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to prepare for a spike in COVID-19 patients requiring care, and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control identified the causative agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of whom recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and in the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities of individual countries as well as WHO, daily at 08:00 AM.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am with data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The evolution of the 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases within EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and increased dramatically around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This change was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have seen similar increases in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in national public health responses, potential variations in case definitions and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reports said that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is necessary to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study in 201011 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100 000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100 000 individuals in 2010).11
Modelling scenarios for care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of &gt; 90% exceeding capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECPCM's rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Since cases were previously grouped together in some regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally accommodate a defined regional population, case and intensive care bed data should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, especially intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent CEPCM Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country can increase its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by mice and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less fatal than SARS, but is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this burgeoning research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, was a defining moment for the Chinese, who were forced to remain in lockdown for the duration of the Golden Week and for longer weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease is called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak started in Wuhan and quickly spread throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO has identified COVID-19 as Public Enemy Number One, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 showing the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarise the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also review what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal human pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of then unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, it was reported that healthcare professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed under quarantine with all public transportation suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered to be the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly people aged 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more commonly found in males (0.31/100 000) than females (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developing in outbreaks, mainly in Hubei Province and the outskirts.
The average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass displacement that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the genera alpha and beta.
The Spike (S) glycoprotein of the envelope binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its cellular dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the site of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more closely related to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in ultra-thin sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human LACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by lorf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by lorf8.
SARS-CoV-2 Lorf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of LIFNβ; however, Lorf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were suggested as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is yet to be elucidated.
Ji et al. hypothesised that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, implying homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-nosed, ant-feeding mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 judging by the 99% genetic homology between a pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results are to be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still poorly understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and humidity of 40 to 50 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is, in general, not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via molecular pattern recognition (PRR) receptors, including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLR), NOD-type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can allow the virus to evade immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defence cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of free radicals, which can lead to severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, to multi-organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by an outbreak, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are at a higher risk of being infected than others.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1 099 cases demonstrated that the incubation period was on average 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine to the most accurate incubation period possible, to avoid transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and those with acute fever, even in the absence of abnormal chest X-rays, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that 98% of patients had fever, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had dyspnea, and 3% had diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilatory support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family and an outbreak that occurred following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% required ventilator support, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher mortality from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
For SARS, the main symptoms were identified as fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%), and sore throat (13% to 25%), and ventilator support was required in approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the mortality rate for SARS in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
A home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without experiencing symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients can be carriers of the virus again, which highlights the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109/L, as well as elevated aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays are seen in most COVID-19 patients, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or opaque glass at the level of the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the most alarming chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was then no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a test strip in less than one hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will improve the sensitivity and practicality considerably, if its use on clinical specimens is successful.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation as well as invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an overreaction of the immune system leads to cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shock, particularly in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include T-cell modulation of the immune response, blockade of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 4 and dHDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroid use did not have beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including osteonecrosis avascularis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, the cautious use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir has also been shown to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In light of these findings, Gilead has sent the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancient practice.
In fact, patients who recover often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognise unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were severely ill.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, along with a decrease in inflammation, a decrease in viral load, and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification is required before this method can be proposed for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause an over-stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to search for antibodies that are effective against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow rapidly increasing the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of ailments.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula which varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the active ingredients are little or not known, as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission from a severe form of the disease.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best recovery rates from COVID-19 were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Province (50%) and Hunan Province (50%) while Hubei Province, which used TCM for only 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%)
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (WM) only and combined treatment using WM and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to symptom resolution and the time to hospital were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone group.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone (7.4% vs 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still to be established through larger-scale, multi-site, controlled trials.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally experience intense anxiety about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those in quarantine also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may increase anxiety and lead to some guilt by patients over the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines, with a view to producing potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and in lethally provoked models and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus has yet to be determined, as no clinical studies have been initiated.
This is probably because SARS became extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
However, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunised individuals is an urgent and essential objective in order to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the long timeframe (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any serious effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects individuals aged 30-65 years, with 47.7% of those aged 50 years and over being affected according to a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health conditions are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to treatment and recovery.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as prognosis for COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, notably the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
So they're traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other elements for determining the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high dose corticosteroid therapy has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and for a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on the demographic studies conducted to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes few or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, similar to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, recently infected individuals or individuals in the incubation period may produce large amounts of virus during their daily activities, making it difficult to control the outbreak.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by critically ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more severe and difficult to control than was the SARS outbreak.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and surrounding cities, as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in order to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinct by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal middle cornea and throat samples from recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented may have worked.
Initial projections suggested that Ebola would cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or that it may evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in faeces, revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients having previous illnesses and 40 healthcare professionals.
Precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected droplets from being projected or deposited onto surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against the inhalation of 10 to 80 nm viruses, with only 5 percent of the viruses able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, as both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear fitted isolation vests to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyes due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear clear visors or protective eyewear when in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to remain confined as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have put China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the new virus was not contagious, had limited human-to-human transmission, and would not be difficult to prevent and contain.
This message led to a notable relaxation, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as every word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential outbreak in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of the population about epidemic diseases, but also to regularly test and improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak gives a déjà vu impression.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that should be considered in containing the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 can be transmitted even when there are no symptoms, whereas SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 lRNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical questions remain unanswered, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originated from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the virus to be transmitted from the initial host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission and the epidemic may resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing the ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to establish a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, though it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible and resume our normal lives.
Generally, the incubation period for both of these viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunocompromised patients developed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Excluding super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could lead to approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, with the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities seen in laboratory tests for suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
The HCoV-HKU1 is a highly contagious virus that is transmitted by the HCoV-269 virus.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-lasting spread after transmission to humans will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportions to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host restriction factors.
In this view, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the larger the number of people infected, the greater the chances that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal is an evolutionary host for an HCoV if it hosts a close ancestor with high nucleotide sequence homology.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and long-term.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies against SARS-CoV, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts cannot be excluded.
The following species of bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Therefore, bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV positive for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East found in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than the distance between beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided over the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the bat CoV, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species boundary to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
The first phase of the HCoV-CoV test is the first phase of the HCoV-CoV-CoV test.
First, unlike alpacas, humans can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-related HCoV-229E alpha-CoVs are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca-CoV alpha has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while the alpha-CoVs in bats serve as the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for decades.
It is well adapted in these camels that have gone from intermediate to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, beta-CoVs from pangolin are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a related virus to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via scavenging or coal mining.
The first is that the virus is not transmitted by the human body, but by the animal's own body.
Humans contract the virus through the cutting and eating of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be considered as  moderate  to  high  with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the adaptation phase of the CoV to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change patterns during lRNA replication through a unique choice-copy mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the virus's adaptation to humans.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to lACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reservoirs of HCoVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in the adaptation to humans, as the related bat viruses to SARS-CoV were isolated, but co-existed with divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 was observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure on their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that the bats had adapted well to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect 'release' by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response in the host.
This is where the secrets of detecting asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat-CoV beta with 95% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat-CoV with 96% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have come back into the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, MERS-DCoV has existed in dromedary animals for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They're very much in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs are circulating in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep away from ecological niches and natural zoonotic reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts.
It is possible to catch respiratory diseases such as flu or colds, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths annually.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against Impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of frequent hand washing is that it can damage the skin by causing a dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis of the hands, characterized by flaky skin and itching, and is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The twice-yearly deworming, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste, is at the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser, since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for special patients and containing triclosan in preventing disease and eliminating bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much more quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated using isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in combination with a thickening agent such as carbomere (acrylic acid polymer) to form a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to form a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively kill germs.
The hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRA and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-like (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and fast activity in removing microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
Frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened by skin emollients and/or skin moisturising agents.
The sweetening effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic material from the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of stopping it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because when it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
The water is recommended to be running due to the risk of contamination of the stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Rub a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them together, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a pool of stagnant water may lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to become contaminated. The areas that are most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers, and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes skin lesions which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap is not available, such as pouring water from a hanging and pierced can or gourd and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap-tooth.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is a matter of debate.
Increasing research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on finger pulp and 254% on palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After drying the hands, the following changes in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
The alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that give out reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to spray and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other through the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the outlet door if necessary).
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
prior to an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
For this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearm should be prevented from flowing to the hands.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved in the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to discover which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
For example, in most rural Africa, handwashing taps are rarely found near private or public toilets, despite the availability of cost-effective options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of hand hygiene promotion campaigns to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behaviour change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters showing good handwashing techniques were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airport toilets.
The expression 'washing one's hands' refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of 'purification', such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.

Because it's flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely due to the pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host's immune system.
The loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to deletion of two nucleotides, is an example.
While ORF4 was observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that the bats had adapted well to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by positive regulation of the NKG2/ CD94 receptor inhibiting natural killer cells and by the low expression rate of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response in the host.
This is where the secrets of detecting asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human cases of infection lie.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in markets have been found to be carriers of viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was conceived by humans, either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, closing fresh produce markets and killing the civets there would have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
The first case of a newly identified pandemic pandemic in the United Kingdom was the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom in the year 2000.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, will be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs are circulating in nature.
In particular, CoVs from bats, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly to humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the ravages caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan would be required.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to keep away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is required to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches and natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
The full secret of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical relatives in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this guideline described our experience and provided references for fighting this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and understanding is gradually advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we responded to a comment about our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a  suspected case  and a  confirmed case  according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
To be able to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a great deal of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and understanding is slowly advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) underwent a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which substantially changed their context.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al. who presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We appreciate their important work and we thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated with the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Trial version 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the characteristic elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the past 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City or surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the past 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed cluster case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a confined space of 2 weeks in a confined area such as school, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
Diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or change of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or ≥ 4-fold increase in recovery phase compared to acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and in the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there is growing evidence to remind us to be cautious in relation to both atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated since they classified people with no clinical symptoms as  low risk .
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of  suspected  and  confirmed  cases, we suggest that they follow and respect the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19-related deaths, a record for the day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country has now recorded a record number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected people recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The public transportation closure began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still allowed.
By 19 March, all three had recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the 15-day national emergency; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
The zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats, where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human disease.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of CoV in humans.
The genus of Beta-CoVs contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
The most common type of HCoV is the HCoV-229E, which is a highly pathogenic virus.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the host (s) reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present worldwide and appear to be transmitted primarily during winter in countries with temperate climates.
Stores in Australia are reducing the limit of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their toilet paper restrictions to two and one pack per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These limits were posted as messages at the cashiers and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Buyers were apparently stockpiling because of fear of COVID-19 and the need to lock themselves in.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous four-pack-per-purchase restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, stated that with the four-pack restriction in place, many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery, and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales have seen a "big increase" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
He predicts higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honour the Wednesday promotion.
In an article on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish their stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a small quantity which, when used up, leave large empty shelf spaces, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
 Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic , Russell Zimmerman explained to ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on holiday over the Labor Day long weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report on 3 March by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado was limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word 'pandemic' refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to push governments to act:
 All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries can detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
 We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction. 
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is  unprecedented .
He said, in comments published by CNN in February, that "apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its emergence until it continues to spread globally".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that  we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus. 
He added:  and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be contained at the same time. 
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the epidemic: "In short, it's going to get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have recovered.
The estimated fatality rate is 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from other people, and monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic has caused severe socio-economic disruptions globally, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages aggravated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, and other people from regions with high numbers of cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and so it is believed that the virus may be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms had become ill on 1 December 2019, and this person had no apparent connection to the subsequent outbreak of the fresh produce market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a significant underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 years and younger accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.The UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases are the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75% were due to pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 could be much higher, as it may not include people who died untested - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of over-mortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged  We know that [the reported number of deaths] is underestimated, a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the US. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality ratio is 6.0 percent (97 039/1 617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated case-fatality ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the lethality rate, which is the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate, which is the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population of infection at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on estimates of mortality.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and definitive duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease becomes short of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at present about when this will happen.
The Chinese government's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that this could be completed by June if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2  will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two .
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said:  I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus  because it is very easily transmitted  will disappear completely  and that  it could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year .
The virulence of this return would depend on the herd immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Later disease progression can result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of COVID-19 carriers who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30%, before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly by close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without protection can send droplets from 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during exhalation, including speaking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The pustules can land in the mouths or noses of other people nearby or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are pulverised and therefore result in airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as skin, before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although some fear that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however, transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one infected person typically infects two to three others, with the virus surviving for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities recommend hand washing after touching animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between pangolin-origin viruses and human-origin viruses.
The overall genome comparison has so far revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, final confirmation is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and CT scanning in Wuhan suggested that CT scanning is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that the CT scan not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first one published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breath samples or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
The test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample may also be used.Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them has proven reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic imaging features on X-rays and CT (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral glass opacities and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently building an international online database of imaging results of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and demonstrated that while the imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its consideration as a screening tool in outbreak areas.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of the virus in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include having good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and then throwing the tissue directly into a trash bag.
It has been recommended that those who may have already been infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission.A number of governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they were infected.Healthcare professionals who are caring for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective eyewear.Finding contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits to this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence in close proximity to other mobile phones.
Users are then notified if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. There are currently misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
Hand washing is advised to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks down its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a daycare center, all rooms such as offices, restrooms, common areas, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and to throw away any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are suspected to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projectiles when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.The use of masks has also been recommended for those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are facing a significant risk, such as caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing a mask may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started to encourage their populations to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical cloth masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are within 1 meter (3 feet) or less) of others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and to clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without a mask or other means of covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed a mandatory mask for everyone in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has required all residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, mandated the wearing of masks for passengers on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made the wearing of a mask mandatory for all outings, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask for those who cannot afford to buy one.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be implemented by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 presence in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They have therefore been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas affected by the outbreak. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the term social distancing with physical distancing, to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, either virtually or by maintaining a physical distance.
The use of the term 'social distancing' has led to the belief that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to stay in contact with others through other means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to follow during the pandemic.
These include the recommendation to only have sex with someone you live with who does not have the virus or who does not show symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 and those who think they may be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper quarantine, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very high have been advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time they may have been last exposed.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The policy is implemented in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are then directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow down the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, in order to inflate the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to below 1.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, and quarantine; public social distancing measures, such as the closure of schools and religious services; public efforts to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions, such as cleaning up surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and localised quarantines, and has issued travel alerts for infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who quarantined themselves, and has imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the US show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression can be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), otherwise transmission will rebound rapidly when the measures are relaxed.
The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop, including testing, existing treatments.
Taking cold medication without prescription or drinking and resting can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory support may be necessary.
Steroid use may worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has stated that certain traditional and artisanal medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating patients who test positive for COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories as to where the very first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus may have occurred on 1 December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; in other words, it was zoonotic in origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Sanitary Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway junction.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted travel and implemented border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantines (also called stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place or lockdowns) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case dates back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public advisory was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
LOMS was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan were given a warning for spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "largest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
A second hospital was built later, Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have introduced several measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Measures for remote working have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation was altered and museums in China were temporarily closed.
Movement controls were implemented in many cities, and it was estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of travel restriction. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.As of 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, this time via a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases within the country has been largely stopped, and that the outbreak has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown began. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa and residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy was to end.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March, and granted monetary stimulus to businesses. The State Council of State Affairs announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government has asked families to pay their respects online to maintain physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the COVID-19 outbreak.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu by a new religious movement named the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of having caused the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules have also been affected and therefore changed.South Korea has introduced what is considered to be the world's largest and best-organised programme to test the population for the virus, and to isolate all infected people and to monitor and quarantine those who have come in contact with them.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the outbreak.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities were accused of concealment that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while this was "certainly not a WHO recommendation", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and spoke of "an unprecedented fact in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PPIUS), the sixth pandemic since the USIPA invoked the APPI measure in 2009.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said USPPI was due to the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros said: "There is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade, and the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute up to $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that do not have the systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even though it was about to appear.
Tedros then stated that we are  as strong as our weakest link  and urged the international community to  invest today or pay more tomorrow . On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".

On 25 February, WHO stated that the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, indicating that while it is too early to talk about the pandemic, each country should still be in the pandemic preparedness phase.
In response to the development of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to the country to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the global threat assessment for the coronavirus had been raised from  high  to  very high , its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency management programme, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready", adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan went on to say that current data do not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, stating that such a declaration would mean that "we accept absolutely that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared that the coronavirus outbreak could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director-General indicated that WHO was "extremely concerned" both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO has faced significant criticism for its inadequate management of the pandemic, including for its late declaration of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The group insisted that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons from minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other non-specified groups in need of government support.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been removed from their posts following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political officials to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, stating that in China censorship has overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic, which was later accused of racism by some opponents and intended to distract from his administration's inability to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a cable from the US government outlining a communication scheme apparently from the National Security Council, whose stated strategy is as follows:  Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in every way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television. Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to gain influence at the global level.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that  China aggressively insists that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner .

On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian Army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political source" who said that 80 percent of Russian aid was "little or not at all useful" to Italy.
The source accused Russia of "embarking on a charm offensive" "geopolitically and diplomatically".
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane loaded with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that  in offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] is assuming that when the American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained momentum, they will be able to give back to them if necessary .
The scope of the NATO Defender 2020 military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest exercise by NATO since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.

The Iranian government has been heavily hit by the virus, with around twenty members of parliament infected, as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care program, paid parental leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's  ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts  after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in two weeks of quarantine at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon for the government's mishandling of the epidemic or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections, and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic buying and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Several communities also faced panic buying which resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles from the shelves, leading to shortages.
The technology sector in particular has been alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to price increases of up to 20 times the normal price and has also caused delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will put healthcare professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for daigous to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan area, and the ensuing high demand for food products, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal stockpiling and trade of essential goods have been a real success, avoiding the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural output, did not see a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only empty temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials unlocked pig stocks to ensure sufficient sustenance for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers keep reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.

The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.

The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employees and self-employed, globally.
The arts and culture sector organisations have tried to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions across the world were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced a disruption. The Vatican announced that Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitential period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches broadcast their services on radio, online and live or television while others offer to worship in a drive-in.

Major sporting events have been either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 English Football Championship, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.[2] Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gambling sites have seen a significant increase in their new registrations.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also stopped all performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from vulnerable areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese people deserved the virus or were receiving justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to people in areas affected by the virus.
As the outbreak spreads to new susceptible countries, Italians, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon'tComeToJapan has been a huge hit on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the UK and the US reported increased levels of racist abuse and assault.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus  Chinese virus, a term considered by his critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the North-East India, which shares a border with China, and students in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and this is why God has taken his revenge on them.
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which called them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" that should be "eliminated".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles related to the epidemic freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This assay is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus lRNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An accurate mortality rate from the disease and the level of herd immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to have a significant effect on reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or expectoration sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing from the pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a spit (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit on 28 January 2020.
It detects the  E  gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a testing bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on 9 March 2020.
Samples should be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for detecting infection with COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system, after previously granting similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that  pulmonary radiographs have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT scans can be conclusive even before symptoms appear.
Typical symptoms seen on DMT include bilateral multi-lobar glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance,  crazy paving  and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that DMT not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from around 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance. Testing can be done in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-speed automated systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required before analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and can now distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to test several hundred samples in a few hours is significantly faster than the PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the start of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were sufficiently robust to be used.
Hong Kong has implemented a plan whereby suspected cases can stay at home,  the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube , patients spit in, return it and later receive the test result.The UK NHS has announced that it is running a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the COVID-19 drive-test for suspected cases, a health professional collects a sample taking appropriate precautions.
 drive  centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Medicines Compulsory Health Insurance stated on 2 March that it has the capacity to perform some 12,000 outpatient tests per day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, the president of the institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
An initial laboratory study found that in the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12/2020 week and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time, by grouping samples together and only testing if the combined sample is positive. Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called Huo-Yan (Chinese: 火眼, French: 眼 of fire) was opened by BGI on 5 February 2020 and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
The Wuhan lab was quickly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be run in small labs without a liquid handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the US.
This situation has led some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now the country with the largest proportion of its population per capita testing for Coronavirus, and was in the process of ramping up testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab with this capacity to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020.The protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not published until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US.China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing from health professionals.
In contrast, experts indicate that the high availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been enhanced over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of testing programmes as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and stocks of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had defects.The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the failure to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results.Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be faulty.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a high error rate and that it did not use them .The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who test positive and tracing of people who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, has produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of those who tested positive did not have symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic progressed much slower than other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on the scheduled date after the holiday ended on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on inbound travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest testing rates, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better at detecting people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capability and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column  Positive in % of tests  depends on the national testing policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospital will have a higher positive value as a percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the practice of washing hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
Handswashing with soap is important at five key times of the day: before and after defecating, after cleaning a baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap at hand, you can wash your hands with ash.
before, during and after preparation of meals;
Before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing a baby's diaper or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet
After sneezing or coughing/sneezing
after contact with animals, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to the sanitary practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a regulation on the protection of the environment in the event of a disaster.
A 2013 study found that improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 percent.
Implementing actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhoea by around a third, a figure comparable to that achieved by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Hand washing with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an act that should be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is generally associated with other sanitation measures as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
Minor adverse effect, frequent hand washing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis on the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Handwashing with soap is important at five key times of the day to reduce the transmission of diseases through the mouth and feces: before and after using the toilet (such as urinating, defecating), after cleaning a baby's bottom (or changing a baby's diaper), before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of disease, particularly before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%) There are several methods today to change behavior and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a  Primary Health Care Program  to promote children's health and education.
The twice-yearly disinfection, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste, is the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Soap and detergents should be added to water to help remove microorganisms on the skin.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
However, adequate water flow makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still states that  liquid soap vending machines are preferable .
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for those who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms are resistant.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the most complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).Rigorous analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for specific diseases containing triclosan in preventing disease and eliminating bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomere (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerol to produce a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
The water-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (3.5 log reduction equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palms and the backs of both hands and the spaces between the fingers and nails should be faced for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and fast micro-organism removal activity; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
Frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may cause skin drying if the formulation is not enhanced by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has shown a decreasing effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income communities, many people cannot afford to buy soap, and instead use ash or earth.
Ash or dirt can be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent the transmission of disease, using the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of the stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Rub a generous amount of soap on the hands, rubbing them together, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub, the more germs you remove.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing in a stagnant pool may lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily re-infected. The areas most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturising lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap-pan.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public restrooms is a matter of debate.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the tissue industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in the hot air hand dryer, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Air-jet drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on finger pulp of 42% and on palms of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms. The scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the appliance at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and appliance and potentially contaminating other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows microorganisms to be spread at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
The paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of micro-organisms.In a 2005 study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with disinfecting wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
The hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in medical settings became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to moisten and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other, passing between the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove them.
Since germs from water can remain on hands, it is important to rinse thoroughly and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the outlet door if necessary).
This helps to avoid further contamination of the hands when contact surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ( germs) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that poor hand-washing is still unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which facilitates the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood-borne infections associated with catheters by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a booklet describing the standard procedure for hand washing and rubbing in the health sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to gather comments from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organisation defines five indications for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
prior to an aseptic procedure; and
After contact with the patient: adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicinal" or "antimicrobial") gives the handwashing agent a germ-destroying action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common.To "rub" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
Hands and forearms should be washed up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
It's not necessary to rub hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from flowing to the hands.
After washing hands, dry hands with sterile cloth and put on a surgical vest.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefit in increasing hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
When comparing handwashing with ordinary soap to handwashing with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher; and when comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores on hands. To improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, training of staff in hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based products, and written and verbal reminders may be necessary.
More research is needed to discover which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health and even good nutrition.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities for hand washing at home, school and workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most of rural Africa, handwashing taps are rare near private or public toilets, despite the availability of low-cost options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap and conducting awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
To achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective.In terms of promoting handwashing in schools, one example is the UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, while adhering to other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand hygiene which are carried out to reduce illness and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries relative to the number of healthy life years gained (i.e. DALYs avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing in Britain.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating  good handwashing techniques  have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing one's hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It is derived from a biblical verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the expression has become widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth takes on a compulsive hand washing to try to clean an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience over the crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or contemplating unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and place more value on handwashing devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of purification, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which involves using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of handwashing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual handwashing (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity, and wudhu in Islam.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace refer to the implementation of workplace health and safety methodologies for risk control in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to infection with COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest exposure jobs are those with minimal occupational contact with the public and other employees, where only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory labeling, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
The occupations at medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, work environments with high population density and some high volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encountering a person with COVID-19.
LOSHA considers health care and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, up to very high risk if they are performing procedures that produce aerosols or are taking or handling samples from people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and appropriate personal protective equipment.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models may change, both in terms of the goods demanded and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside of peak times or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipment of items from geographically severely affected areas of COVID-19 may be disrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an epidemic response include reducing transmission among personnel, protecting those at highest risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework used globally in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve insulating employees from work-related risks without relying on the behaviour of the workers.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or the employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected for the risk to the worker, properly fitted as needed (e.g. respirator masks), worn properly and consistently, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash cans, being prepared to telecommute or shift working hours as needed, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-depressants or other symptom-relieving medications, and that flexible sick leave policies be implemented, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person recently traveled internationally to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments, and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this and higher risk groups include the installation of highly effective air filters, the development of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows, and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing meetings with virtual meetings, and the placing of scaled workplaces, providing disrupted or non-exposed travel to areas of work that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks, the development of a ventilation system, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows, and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings with virtual meetings, the placement of handcuffs and scaled workplaces, the provision of essential personal protective equipment to workers and their families, the development of a safety net for the environment, the provision of public, and other measures that may be necessary to address COVID-19 risk, including the provision of training of workers, the public, and the provision of a means of personal protection against exposure, or exposure to the risk of workers, and the risk of other workers.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following: keeping the sick person 6 feet apart from others, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a protective mask to the sick person, or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel in case of illness and self-isolation and immediate medical reporting to the ship's medical centre if a person develops fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the quarantine person's cabin. For school and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been in a school building, regardless of community spread.
In cases of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals at the cafeteria, increasing the space between offices, staggering arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors, and using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement officers who are performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are expected to come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should follow the same guidelines as ambulance workers, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use with a household wipe or spray and follow standard procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and the containment and washing of clothing.
LOSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to be at high or very high risk.
High-risk exposure jobs include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or take or manipulate samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Procedures that produce aerosols include intubation, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funerary jobs with a high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures that produce aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled with Level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate waiting rooms be segregated based on suspicion of COVID-19.In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respirators approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide greater protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend the combination, as COVID-19 is a respiratory rather than a body fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends that surgical masks be worn only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective eyeglasses or face shielding, a gown and gloves.
In the case of procedures that produce aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given the inadequate global supply of PPE, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a COVID-19 patient's occupied space to those directly involved in their care, use of PPE required for the specific task only, continued use of the same respirator without removing it for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

To all employees of the Wikimedia Foundation:
OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The first is the "Call to arms" (or "Call to arms") which is a call to arms.
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response rests on the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community-building that is at the heart of this organisation.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to have Wikipedia now, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to everyone.
This is possible because of your work, whether you're keeping the sites up and running, ensuring our colleagues are paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
It's a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make some major adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments in Our Work and Schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During this discussion we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the viability of the organisation during this period.
We were all about eliminating stress and sustaining our mission long-term.
If you need to take a step back, don't worry.
All staff, subcontractors and contractors:
Our daily work time target will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to work more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team to revise schedules and timetables to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan in the T&C Ops department so that T&C can help you and ensure that your situation is receiving the necessary attention from management).
Hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced this and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our contractors and our fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours of work under normal conditions.
This applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way of escaping stress from the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask that you contact your supervisor, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Certain tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we have to keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing vital work that may need reinforcement.
We're going to initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to work twice as hard to make up for lost time when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We recognise that circumstances have changed and we will endeavour to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget so that employees can focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to see their work hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Position, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution, we have engaged a virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and the elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork facility, which has shared with us and all Washington DC-based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
As of last week, our Washington DC office has been switched to a fully remote configuration in accordance with the San Francisco guidance.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a building in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working from home are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
The length of the meetings should be reduced to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them over several days.
Set the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make video the norm, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take a group note).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about workplace distribution
The HR Operations team is working on webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support increased work distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained that we understood that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalised for delaying or changing these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines for Wikimania and other community-based and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the follow-up, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will be sending out an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll use this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation affects all of us and we are here to help you in any way we can.
Until then, you can still find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential COVID-19 related information, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and bring all the information together in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, feel free to call and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and liaise if necessary.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
It is rather about recognising that at present our work and our obligations are likely to have to adapt in unprecedented ways.
These are the steps we feel are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to bring our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our scheduled work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that is to come in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each of you to achieve that, which is why you must protect yourselves and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourselves when the time comes.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face.
The first two of these were the members of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
LACE2 inhibits the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. LACE2 is also the entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter collectrin domain.
LACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
LACE2 is present in most organs: LACE2 is bound to the cell membrane mainly of cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, enterocytes of the small intestine, endothelial and venous cells of arteries and arterial cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
Expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
The angiotensin I hormone is cleaved into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II by ACE.
ACE2 in turn cleavage the carboxyl-terminated phenylamine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyze it to the vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
LACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, lapelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
LACE2 also regulates the membranous circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the S-protein to be modulated by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, leading some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help to fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continued standard treatment with ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 demonstrated that  use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects. 
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia. 
Recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) is proposed as an innovative treatment for severe lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulating angiotensin II. Infusion of rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people ( contacts ) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and in some jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, especially those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy concerns.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications into their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore has a new app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been made available as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched StopKorona! , a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development and could be rolled out in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications modelled on TraceTogether in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-tracing application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned several possible practical problems with using application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if only a small proportion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple only allows official or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, especially the potential dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limiting this type of surveillance.
These organisations have set out eight conditions to be met in the context of government projects:
the surveillance should be  lawful, necessary and proportionate ;
Extensions of control and supervision should include termination clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
safeguards against abuse and remedies for citizens in case of abuse should be provided for;
 meaningful participation  of all  concerned stakeholders  would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups.  The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple is to tackle the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network mapping was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems relying on central servers need to access personal location data; many systems have been designed to use central servers for intercommunication only, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device and card transaction tracking data, which they then combined to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following the sweeping changes to privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council adopt a common position on the protection of personal data, in particular the protection of privacy and the protection of personal data.
Details were not yet available on 6 April 2020.
Privacy-respecting contact tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as of 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-respecting solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol.Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matches are made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique builds on the findings of the white paper  Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic  published in March 2020.[citation needed] The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be rolled out in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Google and Apple plan to address the adoption and persistence issues by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Drug repositioning (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the conversion of an approved drug for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research area currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of plasma from convalescent patients. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these link sites provides the realistic blueprint for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds which they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used for certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four medicines being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA' s clinical trial process and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors have advised to use this medicine when there is no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was  clearly effective .
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to have a child.
A study of lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral medicines lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that there was no benefit.
These drugs are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is attempting to modify these drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the Solidarity International Trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance.Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted at the Cleveland Clinic; one in people with moderate disease and the other in people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled versus placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began trials of the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.

A multi-centre study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially reusable treatments for COVID-19:
tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts to develop it are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine is expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred worldwide in 2020, prompting significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative's vaccine development imperatives, defined in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Main platform targets that have been through Phase I safety studies include:
The vaccine is a combination of two active substances: nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I vaccine developer and candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273) and
The vaccine is a candidate for the development of a vaccine against the virus (canSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5).
As CEPI scientists stated in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or design).
A phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is usually randomised, placebo-controlled and conducted at multiple sites, while determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the vaccine' s effectiveness in preventing the disease, while monitoring for adverse events at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human testing (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun work on a vaccine, with human trials expected to begin in 2021.
Plans for vaccine development were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that of neoantigene vaccination used for cancer treatment.

The partners also announced preclinical trial plans and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, announced that it had developed a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human trials scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac large sums of money for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which sparked the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA vaccine.
The candidate dRNAm-based BNT162 vaccine is currently in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that human testing of its final candidate vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that could be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits administered through microneedles induced a significant antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be engineered to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled their resources to access supercomputers from IBM, along with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised trial in Australia is expected to include 4 170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for the implementation of biosecurity level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS first emerged, it was thought that existing research on SARS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral vector, two were adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Posts on social media have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and a vaccine is already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
While most cases produce mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly by close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced by exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being a long-distance infection risk.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease.The standard test method uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their carers.
Recommendations for the wearing of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending their use, and others still mandating their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in walking and blue face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is advisable to seek medical advice immediately.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitation.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, however, preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who are infected who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under study. The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections detected that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking out releases more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing unprotected can spew droplets up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) away.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of patients' rooms have produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus result in airborne spread.
The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours or days.
In particular, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products break down the protective lipid layer of the virus, which inactivates it and removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory illness outbreak.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called  spicule  (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury has been reported in 12% of people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL6 secretory monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses real-time reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment with the test revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The first near-patient test was approved by the US FDA on 21 March 2020 and is expected to be used by the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobular bilateral polished glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar fill) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
The following are the most commonly reported:
Four types of severity of viral pneumonias may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
The following table shows the most commonly reported cases of severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar effusions.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the course of healing: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leucotricho-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow when not wearing a tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC has recommended that people should cover their face with a cloth in public places to limit transmission in asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel, and cancelling large gatherings of people.
The distancing guidelines also include a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, also known as 'flattening the curve'.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not available.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO suggests two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not an active hand antiseptic.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care which may include hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatment may be helpful for those with moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation and pulmonology doctors in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen as a first-line treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in healthcare settings where the performance of procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions.The CDC emphasizes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE vest, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their efficacy against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-indicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or as a last resort, homemade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospitals.Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-throughput nasal cannula or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both provide the same benefits to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the healthcare system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and a high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of ventilation-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under testing are already approved in other indications and testing is already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. e FDA has granted a temporary authorisation for plasma from convalescent patients as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and an ID.
The app is able to detect close contacts using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was intended to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who are not following the quarantine.
In Italy, the regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that  40% of people continue to travel .
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has called for a global response to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, whereas severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however data is lacking for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and damage to the heart, kidney, and liver.
Clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with kidney failure in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in a region can also impact mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of moderate cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration has observed a 20 to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-ICU syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and tested positive for coronaviruses at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered as an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, through the spread of infection.
The exact origin of the virus is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the pathological emergency codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed deaths from COVID-19 cases without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious fatality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from contamination to disease termination.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent of people may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as being related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this difference between the sexes are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences between the sexes, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of comorbidities such as hypertension in men at an earlier age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not collect data associated with gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nursing staff, are women and are at an increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be  COVID-19 .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, with 19 being the first identification of the outbreak: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses  COVID-19 virus  and  virus responsible for COVID-19  in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as  coronavirus  and  Wuhan coronavirus .
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 directive against the use of place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency ventilator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
It appears that man is capable of transmitting the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organisation launched the SOLIDARITY trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is intended to provoke a rapid immune response in the human body in case of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule S protein which helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconstituted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries expected to report by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug candidates for COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggesting the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some have called for independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, states that twice this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or lumiphenovir for COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the primary spike protein that is generated by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. L-oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine shock properties.Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing a non-randomized phase 2 trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine relapse syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified, concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action whereby passive antibody-based therapy can generate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent patients, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
