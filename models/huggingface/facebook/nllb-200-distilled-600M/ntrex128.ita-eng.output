Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about making clowns look like
Some Members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal was made as a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly in the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A Labour Party Assembly member said his party was concerned that it could rhyme with the Twp and the Pwp".
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Assembly stated that the group as a whole was not satisfied and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party has claimed to be open to the name change, but has stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pigeon).
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly committee, which is currently preparing to introduce the name changes, said: 'The final decision on any descriptors of how the members of the Assembly will be called will of course be a subject of debate for the members themselves.'
The Welsh Government Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received broad support for the possibility of convening the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs (Welsh Members of Parliament), but the MWP option was given greater approval in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove a skyscraper for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
President of Macedonia Georgi Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take into account the outcome of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
"The elders I spoke with say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
"There's no one here today".
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today", he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges people frequent regularly".
As for the churches, they are concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos filled with the kind of people who won't help the rest of the neighborhood's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he says, "and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches close completely because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martins a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was preaching in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the parish's governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was trying to discharge the costs on the parish assembly, although the latter was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old in a scuba diving trip to California
Official sources say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then he realized that the boy was screaming I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire clavicle was torn, he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles, a shark guard, said in a press release that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a boost to the beauty industry in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with specialty beauty products courses assigned to specialist assistants.
As part of the important push towards the UK £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest beauty product lines will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also rollouting its boutique makeup line so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly sought after by younger shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will experiment with authorisations at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small quantities of food products daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to do more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos stores to hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-invent enamel in its beauty and pharmaceutical departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-shop pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the programme, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury brands of skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby walks out of an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract with her trendy label to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his Truly home and accessory brand.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their profitable trendy branding business at the last minute to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote herself to their Truly home and accessories brand.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop brand and it was calculated that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his vacation residences.
According to one source, "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It was her long-term future that would hold her for the next 20 years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved utterly speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of the UK's most profitable star, This Morning, could cost the company millions of dollars because of heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible delays in launching the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business".
♪ Words hard and then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his voice imitating the news anchor.
"I have not given up on anything".
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed an equivalent US response to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"We are getting good results with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement for international aid to be activated.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is continually subjected to, the country remains terribly unprepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is heading for Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put improving Indonesia's infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has poured money into roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also has to deal with pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, which fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look, Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is tied against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by one point in the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while standing about 25 metres from Chelsea's gate, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before shooting the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga's back, sneaking into the net.
"I just tried to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I touched it and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled".
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the goal in the 25th minute scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue center forward kicked a spike at Mateo Kovacic before slipping away near midfield and shooting into midfield at Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick move in the middle of the field.
So he made a beautiful move that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard outperformed the defense and finished second on the pole with a left-handed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings collapsed following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, has been strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact them.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just getting started but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially to taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location of the search this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim's family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She keeps saying it's terrible.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the delimited area checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the 30 September registration number 247.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of history writing
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Crick's proposal a "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on statue removal that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
Iconoclasticism during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe must still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than he is today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
This is an extremely accurate representation which is the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated".
A killer pig slammed a Chinese farmer and killed him.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had knocked the farmer down, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin identified by the surname Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that blood taste can act as a catalyst".
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
He explained that the right amount of respect should be shown to them.
The headwinds of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
So, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching drought will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 centimetres of rainfall could cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of 2.5 to 7.5 cm/h in some areas, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas of the southwest, particularly much of Arizona, are expected to receive 2.5-10 cm of rainfall.
Sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons full and storms will blow winds and raise dust.
The approaching plunder will cause heavy local rainfall on part of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited debris flows and slippery debris.
This would be the region's first wet season rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall becomes more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, the US will experience strong temperature fluctuations as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central United States will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will seek to increase and expand again.
A warm start to October is forecast for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26°C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York, temperatures will reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, or about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the compelling testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford has informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh palpated her intoxicated and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during a burning deposition, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who watch the programs in the offices.
To put it all into perspective, it's an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinioners strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning as he was being insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He sat with his eyes closed for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that she has power while many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated that he would have more to say before the elevator closed.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her programmes of letting the European Union make politics about Britain's future and jeopardize national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Brexit Chequers agreement, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective tariffs is "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect in the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defence lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge medical examiner's office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the Louisiana State Police Task Force for the fugitives, the Police Science Laboratory, Southern University Police and local residents who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU Athletic Director thanked the local police for their commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "confused" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about every moment", Wade said.
A volcano filled with ash Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the various cramps and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in a neighborhood in Mexico City called Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by riot police targeted the police with eggs and threw paint to dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the roads that are usually crowded with tourists.
Further collusion occurred during the day with police using handcuffs to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang 'We will not forget, we will not forgive' confronted unionist protesters who shouted 'Long live Spain.'"
Local media reported that 14 people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region a year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum by violent clashes taking place near seats across the region.
The independence groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked", he explained.
Despite a decisive, albeit decisive victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's best-known leaders facing voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the revolution in democratic values and repression by the Spanish government", he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after unintentionally smuggling a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The accident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers.
Dolly Menga 's first goal with Livingston marked the win .
The already promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second 18-game defeat as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up to Division Two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday the top Hearts, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile Livingston continues their division series of wins by staying undefeated for six games, with coach Holt still to see a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is wasting opportunity against unincorporated guests.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he entered to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with kicks.
And that's how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the centre of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but the home team's defense had proven impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly hadn't had to worry too much,
This pattern remained throughout the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The crosses took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigour, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand-failure, were rejected.
A phenomenal performance by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and achievement for the Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and teammates have changed very little since their return to the top flight, but we have to give Holt a lot of credit for how he has been able to propel the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a magisterially organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers were, however, not very inspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some points with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
The last pass was missed - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at deepening relations between NATO allies.
They clashed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the opening of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have given security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist died, shot by a street pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded in a riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security men's prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised agents "Tornado" were deployed to manage the riot, which involves eight inmates and is confined to one prison cell.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to contain an incident currently taking place at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to longer prison terms".
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized following the attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when the last of the energy from the Pink Hurricane will travel through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as far south as eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening in rainy weather.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern zone, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, rain from Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still maintained hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it's expected to hit Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect rainfall of between 7.5 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwestern area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 centimeters", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, then heading through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that Rosa or its strains may pose is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the desert southwestern region of the United States", the National Hurricane Center reported.
It is expected that such rains will lead to sudden potentially lethal flooding and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up the incident on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered from the evil and anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the badness and anger of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and forcefully denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago when she was still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself against the charges.
The President said Saturday that the American people could see Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented public service experience", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment by discussing the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I really do work, he said.
"For this lot I fight hard for outstanding candidates".
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resist and obstruct".
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and casualty numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit beaches, when a large-scale earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 18 feet (6 meters) high hit the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people, killing them and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy with their beach activities and did not immediately run away, thus becoming victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit anything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Agency for Disaster Management showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The seismic shaking continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extenses" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 mi) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, nearest the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications have been totally paralyzed, with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the alarm was triggered.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting in a stirring manner to warn people on the street below of an approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapsed on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
Authorities say the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for emergency only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's awful.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to reach Palu city safely, where employees took shelter from clay in their office yard, they encountered devastating scenes along the way, Doseba said.
"I was told that I saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's awful.
Even as aid groups began the difficult operation of starting the rescue gear, there were some complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian legislation provides that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start arriving if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined".
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing still held the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
A child was pulled from a dump on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding pilots for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran of the parapet industry, I am carrying my emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse within the parapendio community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single grey pop-up sign instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM supply in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man broke into Brink's employee's back and stole a purse with the money for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects who were fleeing the scene, the statement said, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the perpetrators is welcome to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change came before her participation in Saturday Night Live, where she will present her new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means tu said West earlier this year, speaking of the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye -- the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are".
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
Soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people as leftist student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly student grants and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its AI funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various groups in the US government on AI, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much further behind than the US and we need a new revolution in AI", Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big success in AI in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's Chinese section.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, so he could identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's the multinationals", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI", he explained.
The State Council of China published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funding to US researchers, poor quality academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre to involve industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US order to set up a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility of turnout reaching the minimum 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum sheet is: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership and acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the guidance of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name that would open the door to NATO and the European Union accession in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in on top of it, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO accession will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of that 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal by avoiding Brighton's entire defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker was given a midfield transfer at the start of the campaign.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the free field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot into the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about getting him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment".
But it was Sterling who initially brought the Sky Blues to the fore in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court.
He sent a nice filter ball down his left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he left the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive, Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain a game-winning lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least one catch with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still hoping to win their division title.
"Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team playing will probably be at their highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but they're said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a pitching session Thursday and would be the starting pitcher on his regular Sunday of rest.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was put at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working hard, so I'm fighting for excellent candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power using whatever means necessary, you can see the evil, the mean.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of resisting and obstructing.
"And it's been possible to see it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, mean and liars".
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, sparking strong public whistles.
"Remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm looking at a-- that was a bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people saying what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't much of a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a more kind and polite policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable or not for the party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of trend from me and that I would take positions I would never accept, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow insults on social media calling for my retirement, denouncing the centre's politics and telling me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
I have been given many tips over the last two years, asking me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything would be fine.
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government's innuendo that had literally torn my secondary school class apart, I have sought to defend better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused by my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm our family, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I believe are your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is unbeaten and climbs the standings
Two late attempts may have somehow off balance the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this exceptionally fun Tennent Championship Day match.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We must recognize Ayr's merit, they have better exploited our opportunities".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayrs to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers out and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigour before, just halfway through, scoring and then converting a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted from Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was forced to lie down, and at the reboot, Ayr jumped back in the lead thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted from Climo.
Air Vice Captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the man an extra with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of great pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a match against Climo without a ball, from the touch of the ruler, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the forward mixer of the Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had picked up the football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game star is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran decided to move into the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars with longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next series will also be the final one of the show and it looks like Kiernan is thinking of a life after Craiglang.
According to official reporting lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving Glasgow restaurant business".
Bolivia without an outlet to the sea hopes a court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling a naval headquarters covered in sartiam in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it".
Throughout Bolivia, without a sea exit, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile's hands after a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again slip through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, giving Bolivia an outlet to the sea of state competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot to do with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that it would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arbitration shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has crippled any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions after what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly fast.
Bolivia will be able to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile on Monday and will have the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements to mutual benefit, he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political escapade.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen without US confidence
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
He spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on resuming diplomatic talks in a stalemate following the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is an illusion that continuing sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the statement without Pyongyang first undertaking major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows show the latest trend in huge headphones that will soon be in a high-end store near you
If you want to expand your collection of headgear or completely block the sun's rays, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a series of crazy oversize headgear for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been a hit on Instagram this summer and these designers have posted their catchy creations on the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a broad feathered edge that submerged the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included frozen anguries, a witch hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a diving suit with a mask and eyelashes, while another looked like a loose iced cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you're in luck.
Style observers predict that the huge hats could reach you on the high-fashion streets.
The outsize hats come in the wake of La Bomba, the straw hat with a width of over a meter that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creature to the runway: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model that wears it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, finished with raffle fringe and a white leather sleeve was the highlight of Jacquemus's 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I predict that these big beach hats and bags will hit luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of graduation rates, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages got the highest marks.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students achieved the highest grades with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish achieved the highest grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages are considered as a choice of subject at the same level as STEM (science, technology, technology and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees stated for the difficulty in covering jobs were attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have an actual advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of more than one language, particularly in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a workable job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK as of 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with specialised teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may be.
It is not possible to deny at this moment, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first start with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-championship schedule.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly matches to prepare myself", he said.
The moment of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, with a crowd of rallies.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
When is Trump's rally and how can you follow it online?
Trump's commencement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's march in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of commissions is to help Republicans facing the November election get some boost.
So President Trump's campaign has said that these five meetings over the next week are about "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", Reuters reported.
"Congress's control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busiest season of the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the polling queue.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quarters might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum motorcycle is a totally invented sporting concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like this.
So where would the bike be now?
They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping some motorcycle", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is obviously four points ahead with 12 more at stake.
The Americans feel they have a little bit of a wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the score to Game Four, when he and Thomas were two points short of two points.
His putt that got them to win the 15-hole game was met with a similar scream, which tells you he thinks the American team isn't out of the race yet.
"You really have to worry about your game", Spieth said.
That's all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely couple of Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to throw a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That route, and the way their energy seems to flow back and forth to the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Millinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes drowned the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they couldn't even remotely climb out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and foursome matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. held out the most in the foursome, winning two games, but failed to regain the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and the American star Bryson Dechambeau with a sharper 5&4.
Woods, who dragged on for two games on Saturday, showed occasional sprints of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourball, has returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world No. 1 and No. 3.
Europe did not achieve all the results it hoped for on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time Big Ten champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a sturdy 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to the singles, although as a starter, Furyk's team needs only a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea has absolutely refused unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was increasing the country's distrust of the US, which would in those circumstances refuse to renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the World Organisation's General Assembly that North Korea has taken important goodwill measures over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
We do not see any consistent response from the USA, he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no security in our national security and under these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first".
Although Ri reused the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-by-phase" denuclearization that would reward North Korea on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to first have denuclearisation and increase pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even opposes the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can get us down on our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our distrust".
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister, however, stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be at this point dead".
But even so, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korean missiles after the evil president Trump called Kim a missile man engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said that much more needs to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday Trump declared that he had no deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "compliance with the Security Council sanctions must continue strongly and without exception until complete, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing gangster requests.
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took appropriate measures".
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump had committed to Singapore and actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing male culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the world's number one university often have no idea what the basic concepts of self-care are.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally a girl came to me and said, "Why am I being told this only now, when I'm in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance and improve overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course will involve a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, gym shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke cigarettes', added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to 'close nights to study' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with good quality sleep should be students' secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, he explained, and even should help avoid gaining fat because lack of sleep leads the brain into a mode of indecision, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a wake for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking for their first away win since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone on February 1, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's outgoing leader, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-lived Rangers lineup never seemed able to match.
While Ranger is now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be more trouble coming up for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from an apparently thrown object from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that tore a point from the Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team had choked their opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated by ball possession, but Livingston made the most of the balls he had.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga's first-half pass sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A punching kick deep in Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his fellow defensive back Alan Lithgow could only pull aside on the second pole.
The Rangers have taken control but there seems to be more hope than conviction in their game in the rigorous area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should be given a rigour on the 15th after a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to score only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's soft shot.
Although Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again, the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the ball was inserted into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly jumped from the goal line to block it.
But the Livingston continued to draw visitors in exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton made one last request for discipline after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTECT continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A scientific standout ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", played by those unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "It's just going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then see a protein common to many types of cancer and then they are re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has been missing her ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein promotes the growth of several types of tumors, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of removing immune cells from patients to teach them how to hit cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is entering a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bugged in the studio during an episode of Saturday Night Live after an unfinished performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she began a crackdown against Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so many times and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist!
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against the sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's recording of the film was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his headset.
"I got bullied in the backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And so they told me that I was an outcast, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place? and he said,I'd wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments have generated whiplash from audiences at least twice and SNL cast members have seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "There's been a deadly silence in his studio".
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous minds: THANK YOU for having kept your head above the masses".
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just what he is and that's just wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing a vomitary ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now the person previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and he's following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and of course the musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant will appear at the Belfast precinct on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Star of Sword Throne Kit Harington attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series Thrones of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen soils often make youngsters believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he believed that something went wrong and reflected on how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Sword's Throne, admitted to being very concerned about this issue.
'Personally I worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are now observing?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys think they have to be this certain way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young people.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be playing any prequels or sequel to Thrones of Swords once the series is over next summer, stating that he has finished with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to Thrones of Swords.
I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on, he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which is a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within those relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its commitment to tackling the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data, and speaks of dangerous bugs and conspiracy theories.
The US congresswoman denounced on Saturday the allegations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were fomented by opinionists and ultra-right websites.
"Lies, lies and still despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, released by an anonymous member of the Capitol during a hearing by a panel of experts on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information about a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is furious, wrote Fleischer.
"That implies that he has no character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the prosecutor's reasons.
You must remain calm and serene".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's pretty confirmed", he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had alerted the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these allegations.
We will ensure that those responsible are exposed, he continuedand that they must be held accountable for all their actions which are dangerous and harmful to all members of my staff".
Johnny English's review is still striking - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become customary now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
Will the self-deprecating self-irony about how much we crap be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the eyes out of orbit has gotten his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comedy creation developed for non-English-speaking film-goers.
Obviously, it's the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the Gloria moments theme of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It's a character based initially on the mysterious traveler and international man who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly slammed against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems pretty under-sized and oddly superfluous, especially now that brands of series such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags in Atkinson's silent films when he plays Mr. Bean.
The premise of the current situation is that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agent in charge, a role unfortunately very small for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that's making the pot overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister who's already suffering a spell of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character but there's not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And that means that the dirty Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a fancy establishment, but also teaches informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent, here you can appreciate some nice gags when English offers a spy class like School of Rock.
English is retaliated at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunits with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high-society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin of disasters for His Majesty's secret services are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the web of the charismatic billionaire tech man who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to make home with Volta's home.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the final sequence, but as graceful and exuberant as it is, there is quite a bit of children's TV throughout the story.
It's all pretty modest.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to allow British people to work four days a week but be paid five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid five.
The party wants the leaders of the companies to transfer the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources have said that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: By the end of the year a policy review is expected.
It will not be an overnight work week, but a four-day work week is an aspiration in line with the Party's approach to workers' economic rebalancing and its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day work week is not part of the party's policy line and is not currently being discussed.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic sphere.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from faceless managers and specialists in public service enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that current shareholders in water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, as the Labour government could implement deductions based on behaviour deemed unlawful.
It also confirmed plans to include employees on the boards of directors and to create an inclusive fund to transfer 10% of the net assets of private sector companies to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the government agency's findings could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will air Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring to light something that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said that on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that the accusation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
It was resolved, determined, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could stand a bomb-proof indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever you name couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a remarkable string of stars and has an equally memorable mission: ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real purpose, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or actions such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve its stated goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of what's called clicktivism -- people who feel they're really making a difference by just signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million shares of its supporters, operating for a host of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that to date, the hedge funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and enforcement partnership committed to helping children grow to their full potential, with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the allocation of funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, which asked: What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It's going to be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among those performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to implement a blockade and obstruct Russian energy exports.
Washington can, if necessary, use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern core of Europe, he would have said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that waterways remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade so that its energy is not put on the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation which defines itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and fuel replacement, he said, referring to Russia as "unlikely to be versatile" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, an inappropriate gas pipeline project that Trump says has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion pipeline designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The US's stance provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I see as a big problem the interference of a third country in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take seriously considering running for President in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
It's time for women to go to Washington and put our shitty government in place, and that means having a woman at the top, he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for President.
During the city assembly Warren said his own about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was explicit in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by him.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "It's natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58 percent of probable voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported such a nomination.
The poll saw a stronger support for a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent opposing.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in terms of a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he came back, I can relate to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers come back with", he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room and said, of his son and other war veterans, they're coming back a little different, hardened, wondering if there's that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have dedicated themselves to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault and battery on a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence and drug possession relationship, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are waging a legal battle against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington to support an asylum seeker who disputed that policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and her violent gang-member children abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was placed on probation in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances and events of the application, and such a ban violates that principle, the amicus curiae brief states.
In the memo, prosecutors also objected that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the United States damages the US economy, stating the high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion, Sessions said on 11 June, as part of the political line announcement.
Childcare was never designed to mitigate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her fever-prone baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
There's an ambulance carrying bodies at all times.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their shrouded personal belongings, trying to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were devastated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a broken shoulder and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuing strong tremors of seizure.
His eyes filled with tears as he related the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
It didn't take long to save us.
"I'm crushed between the rubble of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "making headway" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to carry out propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid ad by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the top selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election highlighted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now increasing those feuds by publishing advertising propaganda in our free newspapers.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the so-called American tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Conversely, in the street editorial here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the steady fist of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn.
Given that many leading Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various sexual harassment charges, analysts have reported that a negative reaction, especially from women, will be seen in the upcoming midterm elections.
The turmoil in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown their willingness to continue with a vote.
"You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is Coming!" during their protest in the Senate chamber, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars, Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a backlash could have occurred if Republicans had continued to confirm.
For the GOP it has become a confusing whole, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about voting for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have handled the situation and how they've handled it, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe in following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents have certainly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that traces its origins to Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent behind Inrupt is to dominate the world.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data warehouse or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring in the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely derailed overnight.
We're not asking their permission.
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Great War clergyman commemorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honours.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a thick fog, under heavy camp fire and war machines.
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the greatest gallantry advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "really honored" to take part in the parade and added that "the value of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will give him".
MMA fans have been up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they've caught Peppa Pig.
Imagine for a moment, you stayed up all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied visibility of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some have stayed grounded after staying up until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children's cartoons as a "bad-tasting joke".
The government regulation says that at 6am that content was no longer appropriate, so it had to switch to children's programming, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
♪ The pig's mouth ♪ Yes. ♪
Bellator President Scott Coker said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution until Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages coming in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six, as we normally do, and we've tried to get a lot for the fans, and we just talked about it.
It's an unpleasant situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but that provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to secondary school that not everyone is like me.
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she made her voice heard about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the program, Kirsty Young, took a number of months off due to illness.
Introducing himself as a marginalised person in Laverne's first program, Daley stated that he felt less than anyone else as he grew up because it was socially unacceptable for him to like both boys and girls.
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful".
She wanted to prove herself to be something, she said, so that she wouldn't let anyone down if they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used her face at this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - caught me by surprise.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
When he goes through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective has changed.
If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal, he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be around to be in the front row, Dad, he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn't realized yet that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel better", she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes him look like a goose.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record twelfth time, was bench-set by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his game in the range, hoping to correct what was plaguing him.
Having never been the strongest driver at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected route regularly punishes wrong shots.
And if the path itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down from the start of their 12 singles matches, start off with a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
He fully understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow, Furyk said.
He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably never imagined playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is how it went and this is how we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room, he explained.
I also think the younger players enjoyed playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did much more than just play.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal lead, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
I keep telling myself that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but little, Bjorn said (in the photo) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday by 5 to 3 and yesterday by 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
So it will be history that will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
We'll have to give it our best tomorrow.
You gotta go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until the dots are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try and win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world.
Happy with the way his family competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have surpassed myself.
Tomorrow's challenge is a different one.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another matter.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're alone your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message we need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in you.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go out there and get his best.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big last-day meetings, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European Medinah Miracle.
I remember every single word, he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but we want to start right now with the right foot like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the middle games.
So we organize our training accordingly and we rank the kids as we see fit, because tomorrow we're going to try to do some magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counter-offensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
I chose this order because I think it covers the whole journey to the end, Bjorn said of his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again.
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war war ships, but it will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues following the delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as radar, infrared and sound signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have noted a number of crucial software and hardware defects that rendered the ship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half the staff of the oldest Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it was found that the ship was considerably overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the possibility for the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent alarms about the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the Navy was actually short on ships capable of being deployed.
The official said that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research on a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to obtain food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists' study will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The sound analyses recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and how each species behaves.
A map of the habitats and a report will be produced to create a detailed scale-based picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results can reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
Bat species are at risk from construction and development work involving three-legged bats and habitat damage.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-killer paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles along their path.
LNTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trucks and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first bat-only reserve at Threave Estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
We have a large bat area here in Threave, he said.
We have ancient buildings, many ancient trees and a good habitat.
But there is much about bats that we do not yet know, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before carrying out maintenance within the property as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal trident could kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going through it".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to be publicised" by his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made known on Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep the case quiet.
In a video on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33, has blasted the statements as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is false, says the five-time Ballon d'Or turned to the camera.
They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's not uncommon.
They want to be famous by making my name, but that's part of the game.
I'm happy and everything is fine, the footballer added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent that it is in accordance with the gravity of the breach of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly entered the footballer's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo would have knelt after the incident saying he was for 99 percent a brave guy disappointed by one percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt 'terrified by retaliation' and worried about the prospect of 'coming publicly humiliated'.
The 34-year-old now tries to overturn the agreement, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian side Juventus on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers
The UK could forever regret losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also added that he was 'concerned' by the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
We need an agreement, Minister Clark said.
The Japanese automaker argues that delays at the borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other British carmakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of crossborder trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the supply chain risks encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the concept of just in time, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border disruptions could occur, causing delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is precisely designed to avoid these problems at the borders.
We need an agreement.We want the best agreement that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but also seize this opportunity, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other carmakers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted but warned that in the long run the additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the union delegates at the plant, says that workers are very concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are cut, they are no longer reinstated".
A government spokesman said: We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week, as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there was a rumor that he was resigning.
Instead, it was announced that Trump would meet on Wednesday, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI interrogation training against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set, it could be this week, I imagine it will be postponed by another week considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll keep the press updated.
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to a dislike for TV journalists to showcase themselves, although he said:
He suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
The President holds more Q&A sessions than any President before him, he said, adding without citing evidence: We checked the numbers.
The briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this, as we've done in the past few weeks, and this will replace press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have proved the point by giving a freewheeling, yet bizarre speech to a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European NHS workers in Scotland to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government also prepared for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
I therefore wish to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that reinforce and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie was given emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came close to the field and passed out", Reed said.
First responders and medical staff gave Abercrombie on-site oxygen before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no word yet on the type and extent of the damage and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five playoff appearances before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 playoff appearances.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher excise duties for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher flat-rate taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new Labour plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the bowl tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher flat-rate taxes for purchasing property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the boiler tax will apply to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homelessness.
The surcharge, which is added to the current levy on baking, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy to let properties, could be more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a bowl tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by taking over land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to settle the UK housing slump.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of proposals for housing market reform including rental controls and the elimination of innocent evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of the new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a home were as easy for non-UK residents and for foreign companies as it is for UK-based workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's technical director Jack Ross says his "highest aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of relegating the North East team, currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in series B and that's it, Ross told the BBC's Scottish programme Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.
Ross's predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he feels no anxiety about following such important names in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
My success right now is measured by my ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back up.
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as assistant coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to save themselves from relegation to the third tier and led St. Mirren from the relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims he feels much more comfortable now than he did during his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
This was probably a turning point, he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
I really believed that the role of manager was meant for me, more than that of player.
It sounds weird because I worked well, earned a living, and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure but management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel so much more at ease than I've ever felt in my life.

According to one study, the best time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy firm CGA, put the data together and commented: The persistence of the sun and England's long stay at the World Cups caused July to follow a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where most people drink are the strongest, with a homogeneous increase higher than the decline in restaurants.
The pubs where you eat have also suffered from the heat, although not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and leisure sector at RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us the necessary break.
Global pub and restaurant sales growth, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand roll-out.
Sales tracking company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data across 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's leading company.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, own secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear that they will be posted with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a cleaned-up main account to show their parents, while keeping it private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager urging others to rape me.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds own two profiles, and half of these admitted to keeping their accounts private.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board at the National General Assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is deeply respected by the Scottish, British and international athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could benefit enormously by being included in the board, Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, and is currently a BBC commentator, has found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a tiring job, but I recovered completely, she learned to walk again, and today I am moving agily!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
Advertising a circulation compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A company that produces a milkshake has divided opinion online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are being weaned.
To mark the launch of what is being described as the world's first silent, wearable tiral, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a commercial in the form of a humorous music video to show the freedom of expression as mothers given by the new tiral.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yeah, I'm getting my milk but I don't have a thing" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts but my tits".
The choir continues: "Pull it out, pull it out, feed the children, pull it out, pull it out, pull the milk to my ladies".
However, the advertisement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom have claimed it highlights the horrors of the dairy industry.
An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's bra is discreetly worn under a mother's bra.
Another commented: Comprehensibly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a poster for mothers who will continue to keep their children?
Another added: "It's really a pointless advertisement.
Others have defended it and one woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like one.
When I used the draught, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little irreverent, but it's not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny ad for moms who use the tiral (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'mugs.'"
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the farming industry".
Finally, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tirallet inserted into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the tiral feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breastfeed is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be inserted into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold babies and even come out while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie tiral is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use cow-calf cattle we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new cattle-calf cattle can provide".
This isn't the first time the Elvie stripper has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two showed up on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policy line have made it harder to take care of these children.
Most of those who took them in were usually illegal immigrants who now fear risking staying in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective adopters and other adult family members would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who offered to take children into foster care alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who offer to take children into foster care or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people down", Albence said.
To try to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard time before, according to the receptionists.
Many will appear in video rather than in person to bring their legal case to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children stay in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempted escape, according to the people who work at the reception points and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure like Tornillo's where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children's signs of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma many are already experiencing.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions", he said before the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been forced from their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that push refugees away from their homelands.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return", he reiterated.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicized".
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be provided in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to 'revision of the articles of the current constitution' without any interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency should end prematurely due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential end ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of a downturn in viewership.
Since 2014, the first-night ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on its first night, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed the network's percentages to reach 3.5 million viewers on the nights with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something that can be explained", says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's "Designated Survivor", which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh".
Chaos is therefore a source of amusement.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or not, and the health of the global economy.
But stopping watching the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond their duty as informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth straight hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of tracottage", The Washington Post commented) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' disgusting descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, can't watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason it looks like a reality show is that there's news every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and the daily developments of Trump's show's plot (in contrast to the N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you're going to be left behind.
This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north shore of Kauai and even though it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in his house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we used to do all these absurd programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Flow of foreign money in the run-up to the closest midterm elections
It is no surprise that the 17th District is experiencing an influx of money as a result of a congressional district realignment that has resulted in two incumbents now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the Pittsburgh suburban district brings to the scene Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituencies had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district sparked a campaign marked by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
The political opinioners gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought it would penalize El Salvador because it supports China, but then it changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership group to leave.
State Department officials decided to bring back US diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
After a series of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the administration's importance to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, of domestic decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the History
In the report he will publish, Special Counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact that now seems to have sufficient evidence.
According to reports, Mueller's investigation is intended to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump would have to answer these charges to voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the fall of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight might last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed on that occasion to let the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed slip away.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing different kinds of problems right now.
What if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted questioning his ability to assume the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the news in The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with a swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future".
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna.
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them a great opportunity to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result can enable Rangers to do great things.
"It was a positive result for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We faced the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
We might have won in extremis, but all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while we were better in the second half.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to score all three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have done well in the last game but I am sure that with the support of the public we will be able to not disappoint.
Last year was definitely tough because of my injuries and the changes at the club level but now the feeling is positive.
The team's in shape, the boys are having fun, and the preparation is going well.
So we can forget about the problems of last season and think about the future".
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although the survey participants have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in their family.
About half of those interviewed by Nationwide say they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% say they have spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, "people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have that conversation".
That's where we start.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You cannot prepare your family for your attendance unless you communicate what you want in time.
If you have a counselor, you and your family members should decide where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can determine the cost.
Involve a financial advisor who can advise you on how to pay the expenses you have to deal with.
The choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy or a life insurance policy with a redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance for as long as you can.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles on your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and ensure that professionals meet your needs in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case you are unable to do so.

Man shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while he was walking after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim hasn't seen her attacker.
He's not in any danger of death, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications are cut off and rescue officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of Central Sulawesi province and especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern area of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The casualties were more than 1,100.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami in this case but over 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped off her handset.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three first-degree felonies, up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been accused of criminal activity.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of the crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks are down and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media is streaming videos showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking extra capital punishment for suspected terrorists in NYC.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot van to lead a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the death penalty application in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and likewise "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these defendants can be sentenced to death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in connection with the crime, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and vehicular destruction.
The attack required "a real planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's handling of the attack as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York filed the last capital punishment case.
The man brought to trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he was proud of what he did in front of investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 charges, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had earlier begged prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When a member of parliament from Theresa May's party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would "already be out of Europe" if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been highlighted by the Tories in favour of staying in Europe who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong collective backlash and forcing eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave organisation's meeting in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting the negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now", he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining his reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he stated: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country".
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and it does not enjoy the favours of our party and our activists who are walking the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a powerful message to May, he added: "Prime ministers can keep their positions when they keep their promises".
At the hearing, Farage said politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they intend to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the pressure felt on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people's army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have pushed the Tories against the Brexit flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's all a sham.
A good Brexit does not exist", he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she would run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to set up government and that implies a woman holding the highest office".
Arrested for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they've arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he posted a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man seen in the sequel.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene with a gun and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-3, Baton Rouge senior, Sims played in 32 games last season, including 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of fellow driver Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the orders of the Mercedes team would heavily affect the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well, leaving Hamilton to defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the boxing, leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent the pass inside risking to end up out after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he's already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the tire change boxes and attempts to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by taking fourth place.
However, he must make the pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is unable to increase the pace and overtake Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and was really nice to let me through.
The team did an outstanding job of taking first and second place", said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language.
In a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "mechanical, bad and lying".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and lying", he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being spread and those responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get the news?
Remember his answer, did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't".
Wait a second.
We revealed it... No, we didn't", she added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies that the disclosure was leaked from her office.
"I did not cover up Professor Ford's accusations, but I did not reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did".
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own ends.
"They're trying to regain power by whatever means necessary.
You see the meanness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to take back power and control", the president said, Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars recovered from their defeat in the Elite League game on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the draw 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants jumped out to a two-goal lead on the shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team for the lead before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the match against Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season and the Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assists, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assists.
In what was a pretty lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt provided the tie-breaking assist to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the Giants lead by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team has recovered and Bouchard has regained the tie after a strategic maneuver in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which led the Dundee to their first-ever lead in the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games so far, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he dies for allowing a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing due to a powerful earthquake that hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the fearfully oscillating control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
So he jumped from the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is really sad news for us", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the National Disaster Measurement Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and many more have been unreachable", explains agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarketes are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after the lagoon crash
The airline that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board, including passengers and crew, had managed to survive, now claims that one person is missing.
According to Air Niugini news, updated Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing on the call.
The airline confirmed it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the accident occurred as the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came to a very low altitude.
"And it was really a fortune", Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking through the water that was bringing life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was slightly shot in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors working nearby to repair a bridge also provided relief by using a rubber truck to carry people ashore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline aircraft accidents registered with PNG but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
Saturday marks the end of the presentation of the evidence in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the accused 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several cell phones that show that, contrary to what she claimed, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, he confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data shows they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the judgment to be delivered to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge this negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into their songs.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and do a conscious hip-hop genre again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK boom thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues a couple for firing her with a "racial" text
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for dismissing her discriminationfully after she mistakenly received a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, "embarrassed" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that she was unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice for her day's work and drove her home in a cab.
Maurice sued the couple and, to be fired, she is asking for compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that firing Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent her a message saying something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone you have been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so".
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get along with a person like this.
It is not very kind of behaviour", the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court immediately denounced the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the big success Paddington has".
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a rather calm man, not a presumptuous person", he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved as if he had a child who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not your fault.
I think that's how he interpreted Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself".
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my dying daughter.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really bad and that our daughter would not make it", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me that she would be dead in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that doctors had given her to allow her heart to continue pumping was slowly diminishing.
She died a while ago, and that was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing all this was going on.
I could not complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew", he says.
"All I did was cry low.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Tickets for two grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide make an effort to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day", she says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said it lit up every room he went in".
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had taken him "to a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear a chain reaction".
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk".
Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you were down or depressed", she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day touched the bottom, and when the children opened the presents, she avoided looking them in the eye".
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "It tore the family apart.
He tore us to pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
"I think if we could proceed as you asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "losing its cool" because of the blockade of hardline supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
With only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6, if the Republicans, as expected, get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
It will be voted on in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear yet if Kavanaugh will win at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean political refugees "fall" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says that the number of refugees was 1,127 last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded from those who illegally take these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation which are in a stalemate.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work together to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and argues he's not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not in a good mood to serve in that capacity.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved in the same way, they would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly excited, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so excited that he almost screamed and cried his throat out as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats who called the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated smear campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't get into the Supreme Court because he's proven he's been wary of the Democrats.
"I think he's excluded himself with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh on trial if the case was confirmed and if the Democrats would reach a majority in the House.
"I think if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is it not appropriate for the Supreme Court, but it's not even appropriate for the court you're presiding over now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said that "you cannot send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and expect this decision to be accepted in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a fairy tale, months and years of anger attacks that she can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And she continued, "I was a great help to a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she told me that she cried when she got angry, too, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry".
And so it went on.
I thought your idea was brilliant".
Tears are tolerated as an outpouring of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories I have of my previous job in a mostly male office is when I once started crying over an angry outburst, when an older woman, an ice cream manager I had always been slightly terrified of, grabbed my ass and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let me see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're holding you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business that forced her to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not try herself to run for president.
"It was not really a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was no need for another.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraiser and vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who gave the male candidates $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked himself.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives, and anger over the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
"I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled, thinking about the press reaction.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "she cried a lot".
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening shots of the US-China trade war have been fragile and while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be advantageous for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of goods, which means that half of the goods coming from China will be taxed.
Beijing has repeatedly reacted with similar measures, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US$60 billion of goods.
China has promised to respond to the US one at a time and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economic power will soon back down.
For Washington to give up, we should give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far", says Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of the refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would willingly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has thus lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the 16th hole of par 3 awarding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds by becoming one of only four players ever to record a 5-0-0 record since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the score of 5&4 by the lower ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the most successful European player in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I won the trophy back.
It is a team victory and I am happy to have contributed", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the testimony to his fellow American John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2&1 score in Sunday's singles.
"If I think I grew up watching his matches, I'm really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his Ryder Cup record stands at 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you consider that he's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I am proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on Team Europe.
We've missed this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have been very good.
I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
We've been putting it all together.
But they played better than us".
Red tide update: decreasing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spot-flowering conditions, suggesting a decrease in concentration, are evident in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County south of Lee County.
The patches are about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were reports of average concentrations in Pinellas County or off its shores, low-to-high concentrations off Hillsborough County, bottom-to-high concentration in Manatee County, bottom-to-high concentration in Sarasota County or off its shores, bottom-to-medium concentration in Charlotte County, bottom-to-high concentration in Lee County or off its shores, and a concentration in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
While last week, there were no reported cases in northwest Florida.
