FANOS of Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release issued by Lenti.Ru.
The third meeting will summarize the year-long work of the Expert Session and form a final list of indicators for evaluating the results of scientific organizations.
The participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for evaluation.
The third expert session will be the closing event in a series of events to form a common approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
We've been able to do that for the past five months, and the final version of the regulations is in the works.
At the end of the next session, we should complete the formation of scientific and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of evaluation", - said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert-analytical department of FANO Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions.
The resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the following address: Moscow City, Solyanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to find their own stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studied turbulent mixing and its effects on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of the specialists will allow us to look for stars that are related to each other, that is, that have emerged from the same cluster.
The authors published their findings in Nature, and a brief review of them is available on the university's website.
The same chemical composition of the nearest stars is due to the turbulent mixing of gas clouds that preceded the formation of stars.
Even if a star is born and then leaves the cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birthplace and the region of formation of the parent stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the cluster.
The results of the astrophysicists' simulation show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to model two interstellar gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This object is transformed by its own gravity over several million years into a cluster of protostars.
Scientists added markers to the initial gas flows and found that the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to look for stars that are related by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karrata police arrested 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed limit zone and through bushland to escape the police in Pilbara.
Carruth transport police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding it was speeding up to 125 miles per hour when it left the service station on Batgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then rolled into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were spotted near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Karata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He's due to appear before the Karata International Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and held for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "knock on the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the MGIMO.
As for our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, I will not even fantasize, because everything must be calculated concretely, "he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will look like this time, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
It will not be about knocking on doors, some kind of offense, misunderstanding, "the minister stressed.
We will, first of all, push our interests aside, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the partners' actions on their adequacy, contractibility and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, we can judge very well what the partners are achieving, - continued the Russian Foreign Minister.
If they say out loud that "they'll punish us, too, but we'll have to punish Russia", that's probably not very good.
As for the WTO's exit from the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO's tools, including when it comes to trade disputes", Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the third energy package of the EU cannot be applied retrospectively", Lavrov said.
How to use sirens properly in garden design?
The following is the answer to the questions:
Since sirens lose their main attractiveness after flowering, they are best planted with other shrubs.
It's a great mix of cultures.
Besides, you can and should plant plants that are decorative at other times and that are blooming at the same time.
Another plus of a siren is that it provides a lot of creativity.
You can make it with a stump tree of varying heights, an improved bush, a broad-based bush, and even a garden bonsai-like tree with a strangely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia , a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for selling fake money
According to the Republican Interior Ministry, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonetsk and Segezh districts.
Apart from Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
The man later appeared before the Olonetsk district court.
And to finish the investigation into crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segezh.
The investigation has proven guilt in several cases of counterfeit money sales dating back to the summer of 2013.
In late June of this year, the criminal case materials were sent to the court with an indictment.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the sentence of imprisonment with four years in a general colony.
The sentence has not been carried out.
Last week, two other sellers of fake money were convicted of paying off their debts in the Petrozavodsk stores.
Azerbaijanis also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One is sentenced to five years in prison, the other to four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet been passed.
In Arhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arhangelsk, a memorial rally took place near the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov name beach in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the veterans' organizations of Arhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first met 23 years ago when the cornerstone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea", said Boris Karpov, chairman of the board of veterans of the Northern Sea Navigation.
Then the city wind orchestra performed, and cadet students gave flowers to veterans and marched with Russian flags and the Victory flag.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the stones.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (up to 10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal shoes, tin, wool and many other supplies and equipment).
In addition, the ships were equipped with military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, in disrepair.
The convoy escort consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The convoy of ships was not discovered by the enemy and reached its destination safely - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital caravan operations, 126 transport and about 50 warships were lost.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects the organization of unions as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs", says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chairman of the Progressive Party Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Rights Amendment Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of union opponents.
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow workers facing discrimination for participating in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation and fines - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the bill's co-authors are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks on labor unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country was at the same time defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that read openly: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to impede this right will have no legal force; measures aimed at these ends will be declared illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairwoman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United Nations would adopt as a world treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and its authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests".
For generations, Americans have taken it as a basic principle that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize unions - and that union to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the nation's power, but increased it.
Raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as we should.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and expanding civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically enlarged America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the implementation of a Louisiana law that his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and was set to go into effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's ruling means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being, while still seeking such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing their powers of attorney", wrote Judge John deGraveles in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month of the judge making a more permanent decision under this law.
Abortion rights advocates have welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to get hospital clearance.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northtap, president and director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was applicable to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently ruled that such measures are unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on abortion laws place restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion object to such measures being aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were to stop doing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop doing this procedure, the group said.
In a statement, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for a license were pending.
What will the introduction of quotas on domestic products lead to
At least half of the products in the range of trade networks should be Russian, according to the deputy of the State Duma from the "Justice Russia" faction Oleg Nelov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed to avoid any discomfort for the buyers.
For the rest of the products produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers", - said Nilow.
Along with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in the trade networks is part of the package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic products on the shelves.
However, experts say that the initiative can have both positive and negative effects.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalogavik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and lead to growth.
And then there's the farmers, the farmers, the small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means the profits will increase.
They will also be given the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, who will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activity and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
It will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will expand, some will grow faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately", the expert noted.
Earlier, Russian companies often could not break into local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, with the embargo, this niche is free and you can breathe with relief.
But we must not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin American countries, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "quiet moment" when the old players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products", - told AIF.ru the first Vice-President of the Russian financial directors' club.
The idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food in each category will certainly help to consolidate the sector with local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper than subsidies from another state.
In other words, the buyer's fight will be between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kсьянова notes, Russian producers are not able to meet 50% of the compatriots' domestic needs in all the articles.
In this situation, the trade networks will have to "extract" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
There is growing concern that the shelves will be filled with poor-quality goods.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied as Russian products", the expert adds.
The negative impact of the quota will be felt by the major retailers, especially those who are more likely to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers will also suffer from this decline, as demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products produced in Russia may be inferior in quality to imported ones, while stores will be able to raise prices for secondary products as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was discussed again by economists in February of this year because of the relentless devaluation of the ruble.
Now, amid the difficult relations with the West, the question of refusing imported products is becoming even more pressing.
The law requires retailers to consider domestic manufacturers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import substitution, and the system of planning production on the necessary types of products will be created in shorter time", says MP Oleg Nelov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25%.
Our farmers are actually able to cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also gain a powerful boost.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% of the production is still Russian", says Kсьянова.
Experts believe that introducing quotas on domestic products will help to replace imports and can speed up this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as a set of measures is needed, Litvinenko believes.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, meaning there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there is little to establish quotas, there is still a need to establish domestic production in the country to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees", the expert said.
A timely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more people.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who live in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent survived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in the regions and outlying areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
NEW DRUGS may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the women's medical pathways for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current disease status and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer in the later stages at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in the regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons who specialize in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in the big cities", she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, underscoring the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young Gold Coast mother, Elisha Neve, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September , the new FAP will open in the Kužer district
The construction of the medical facility in Toktaybelak village was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the works was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility is almost 230 square meters.
The residents of eight settlements will be provided medical assistance: the villages of Toktaibelak and Dementiev, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelk, Shinuur and Chachkayal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
The newlyweds who killed their four-month-old son in a state of intoxication will appear in court
A Chuvashia resident will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksars, the investigation of a 31-year-old woman in Novoseboxarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, is completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 this year, the accused and her four-month-old son were in Cheboksara for the birthday celebration of their cousin's child.
After a long feast, the new cheebokserk decided to stay with the guests and put the baby to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the woman laid him on the bed next to her to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, a woman rushes over her son, causing him to die of choking.
The criminal case, the press service of the SCR SUD for Chuvashia reports, has been sent to the court.
Inflation is out of date.
Will Russians feel the sharp rise in prices
As a result of the cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not fit the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of "VTB Capital" are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation will be 6.5-7.5% in 2014 and 6.5% in the next year.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the EMI should make "small, but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast for 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation rate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in population incomes.
The forecast suggested that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation would be in effect for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be predicted in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change", the source told the newspaper.
Economists at VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of the food ban will come together with the possible introduction of sales tax (SPS) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The 9% inflation rate will peak in February, after which the annual price growth rate will decline, experts say.
By the way, last week, Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "careful sanctions".
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex:
The price increase is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, as socially important products became more expensive, the government was forced to launch systematic price stability monitoring to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulators on a daily basis so that authorities know exactly who is pushing for price increases, when and for what reason.
The growth of the consumer price index continues to be driven by the huge capital outflow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, domestic conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure were kept under control, the value of the minimum food basket would not have jumped 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on food imports has caused a shock to the domestic market and led to a logical increase in the final price.
As we are not able to fully implement the import substitution mechanism at this stage, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to carry the risks of inflationary growth.
If we add to this fiscal reasons, which are the lack of confidence in the national currency and the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razуваev, director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% a month, it was also above zero levels, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8 to 8.5% by the end of the year.
Plato Magut, asset manager of the Magut Fund
The external factor of sanctions against Russia is being successfully contained, but if further pressure is put on the financial sector, it could lead to some difficulties and increase the population's inflation expectations, which are usually expressed in purchasing cash to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the price increase traditionally starts after the summer calming and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5%, is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial accumulations.
Garden centers are saddened by the decline in homeowners
Such a drop, driven by a sharp decline in homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centers losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach "the basic age of gardening", according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving yard lots for parking and the reduction in garden sizes as other threats to the industry, which is estimated to have annual sales of £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK's lowest spending on homeowners' goods is.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting a house and the lack of space for the garden did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's chief horticultural adviser, said: "Containment, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can bring plants with them when they move".
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of the increase in homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has carried out a mass cleaning in the "Landfarming" fund
Three of the four heads of the Land Farm Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Landfarm Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture has only officially announced the removal of its Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
He was replaced by Lozan Vasilova.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the foundation were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was responsible for the state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I didn't attend the board of directors because we're not board members by law, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday", Angelova told the publication.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who was the head of investment lending at the central fund of the Sofia-based Landfarm.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
He will be replaced by Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the "Zemledzhije" fund in Veliko-Tyrno until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund Atije Aliyeva-Veli retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat over a report of espionage
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior American diplomat to clarify a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US Attorney General and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence object sparked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Biggest Chinese companies have joined forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social network, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, with Wanda owning 70% and 15 percent of each of the internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
The company is planning to register in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 trendy hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year , the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $ 8 billion) in building a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring in a profit of $960 million.
Wanda also owns the American movie theater network AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the world's largest movie theater operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, says Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online shoppers to regular offline stores or to purchase other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the Groupon or Vigoda.ru coupons.
"O2O is the biggest online cake", said Wanda's chief executive, Wang Jianglin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"There is no real O2O platform in China at the moment, and in this situation, everyone has about equal chances", he says.
China's e-commerce market is the world's largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, reaching $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: more than any other country in the world except India.
And it's predicted that by 2015, that number could grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was the richest man in China until recently, but according to Bloomberg's Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Li is currently ranked third among China's richest people, while Wanda's Wang Jianglin is fourth.
"It's very interesting to watch the battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge even richer people", said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou, Cao Lai.
But he believes the new company is unlikely to compete seriously with Alibaba right after it's founded: "Rome can't be built in a day".
That Alibaba is not just a competition for new companies, but also for well-respected global internet leaders, the report on Alibaba's financial performance for the last quarter published the day before shows.
Alibaba is often described as the middle of eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit over the period is almost twice the sum of its competitors' similar figures - it's almost tripled in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential to generate money, largely through its mobile apps", commented a report by Bloomberg analyst at Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
And 32.8 percent of Alibaba's transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be on September 16.
The company's road show, which precedes this event, will begin on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will bring in about $20 billion.
The record for the volume of funds traded on U.S. exchanges was held by Visa, which made its initial public offering in 2008 for $17.9 billion.
At least half of the foodstuffs in the trade networks should be Russian, state Duma deputies believe.
They drafted a bill on that.
The amendments to the article 8 of the Federal Law "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code are being made.
The document aims to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, is that at least 50 percent of the products of domestic production in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so a discount will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also changes the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a reduced rate of VAT of 10% on the sale of all food products, whose country of origin is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestia".
On 27 August, the lower house of parliament introduced a bill to amend the Federal Law "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers can sell their products.
Magalof police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials of Calvia to the Mallorca State's Attorney's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious Magalufe disorderly drinking center.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under arrest as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials of Calvia to the office of the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that the protectionism of the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving", one businessman told the court.
We cannot jeopardize our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaloff made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video featuring an 18-year-old British vacationer who shot 24 men during a bar run.
Since then, the island's authorities have tried to stop drunken bullying amongst the holiday Makalufa by minimizing the number of notorious bar bar alcohol runs.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mining incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organisers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined €55,000 ($73000).
The tourist resort of Magalof, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the scene of numerous drunken accidents involving a crazy fun known as "balconying", when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport
A COLD surprise has recently come to the south of South Australia, with heavy rains and strong winds affecting flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 millimeters of rain fell on the city at 9 p.m. on Sunday, following the 6.6 millimeters that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a gust of wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and rained out nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter delivered an early portion of spring last week, temperatures dropped again to a peak of only 15.8C in the city on Monday.
The good conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons Virgin Airlines' flight from Melbourne to Adelaide was delayed.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but it hit a wind shift zone - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over short distances - and was forced to climb.
Wind gusts were reaching 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused subsequent delays on several other flights, including Emirates' flight from Dubai and Qantas' flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with one or two showers.
The construction project will be calculated in a new way
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has a special control over pricing, building regulation, and networking.
The FAS has established an expert council on competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the FAS Housing, Construction and Natural Resources Control Office Vadim Solovyov said that "today's estimate of the construction projects is completely incomprehensible".
The normative framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, FAS believes.
And they propose that the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage be determined based on market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current smetable norms and unit rates for technological operations.
These proposals have been put on the roadmap and are now being considered by the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional smete documentation in construction for the calculation of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry, - explained "RGB" Vadim Solovyov.
Because now, every bolt and nut is counted in the bill, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfaithful construction companies can bury "entire tractors".
The FAS and the Ministry agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the cost calculation of constructive elements are already there: methods for calculating prices for constructive solutions, the composition of the estimates according to these indicators have been developed", - said Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban activities and architecture of the ministry of construction.
The pilot project is the road construction sector.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyankos, the smeta regulations are long outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations on the construction elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, as the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies", he says.
It's no secret that the construction industry is largely driven by government orders.
According to the chairman of the board of the "Expert community of state-order professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Deputy Director for Engineering of the ROSATOM Capital Construction Center Vladimir Malachov pointed out that today the market is divided into companies that have access to the contract portfolio and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believes that creating a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is kept as safe as possible from the influence of someone in charge.
The expert council proposed to form the state order system in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be assessed in terms of its impact on business and the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to provide the customer with the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff and budgetary expenses for its maintenance.
The customer's specialists must have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work carried out by the contracting organisations and their safety.
Often, this sort of breakdown will require determining who will be responsible for the overall safety of the facility.
In addition, this approach may lead to the withdrawal of highly qualified participants in state procurement due to the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for incomplete work volume and a small amount of contract.
Deputy head of the consulting center of the Institute of procurement Alexander Evstachenkov believes that the procedure of the state order has now become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "When filling out the application, the participant must indicate 'specific indicators' without the words 'or equivalent', 'must be', 'of', 'more', 'less', 'analogue', 'or', 'type', 'analogue type', 'not lower', 'lower', 'higher', 'may have', 'may have', 'before', 'not earlier', 'not higher', 'not allowed' etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the contents of the submissions submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstachenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant.
The expert believes that by examining the applicant's application, only the contractor's qualifications can be evaluated, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been completed.
The quality of the work can only be assessed by accepting it.
The expert council also proposed moving marginal income from the top to the bottom so that intermediate contractors disappear.
Chairman of the expert council, status secretary, deputy head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Or else, as in the famous Arkady Rykin retelling "Athlete": "Do you have any complaints about buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and landmines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The beginning of the school year brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-hit settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the personnel of the Pashoch kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed the traces of the fragments from the walls and the childrens' mounds before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward", said Ronith Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our neighborhood really need to get back to normal.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shanny Bart, said that going back to school was "a little weird".
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Sa'ad were either not out or out of their homes, moving to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza-boundary city that has struggled to cope with Palestinian fire.
He advised children to study hard and said, "We will do everything we can to provide you with knowledge and ensure your safety".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately ended hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian estimates and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rocket and mine units at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting was still going on, the officials responsible for education postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can finish our education as children of the world and Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to a popular benchmark, real estate prices have shown the highest winter growth in seven years.
RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic's housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 percent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the growth in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, said Sydney and Melbourne are running a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, housing prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending cuts went up by only 1.4 percent a year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the price of housing will continue to rise over the next three months", he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
The former home of goldsmiths and miners of Eudokim and his son Ivan Demidov at 57/1 Oct. Revolution Street (formerly the Great Kazan) has 18 apartments.
The house has remained largely unchanged since the 18th century, except for its age.
Strangers come here as an excursion, and the residents suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest house in Ufa, whose walls commemorate the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is not accurate, but historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is at least 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, scratching stairs.
The doors to the apartments are close together, the walls are torn apart, and the street is visible in the lights from the blurred plaster.
I think it's all about the honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's the case".
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the XVIII century, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No 3.
The building is in the state treasury, but there's been no money for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have forgotten about.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still badly held, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom outside and bathe in a public bathroom once a week.
How can we be happy in such a situation?
The road goes right under the windows, there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana is moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've only heard before: cars are flowing under the windows.
You see, the glass is always rusty, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
But man is used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
Other families have much worse conditions, with ceilings on the second floor being just over a meter high.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit her neighbor from apartment No. 6, Ludmila Starościna.
A friendly, hospitable woman offers a cup of coffee from the door and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 square meters for four people, and that's how we live: my husband and I, and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place to live, and Lyudmila looks around the room: anthersol, two sofas with the letter "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
It is very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But the ceiling is running out of water. The water system is no good.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment as ordinary and surprisingly as an Italian woman whose house is in Roman ruins.
I mean, it's a very old and recent, everyday and legendary thing:
The waterway was built about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then we had a little kitchen in the backyard and a toilet made of a former junkie.
We live right where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, so why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says privatization is not important.
We're still getting a one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to move us, but they didn't.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't be.
This apartment (room!) was the home of a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mother and father, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, big rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flagel, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks Demidov!
Probably just because no one's been killed by a roof or a slide.
The building itself is still dying slowly before our eyes: the boards and timbers of the houses are rotten, the floors have fallen down repeatedly, we have poured cement, but all is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say there is a secret sink under our room and a walk to the White River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that you could hide from danger, in case of any.
They were being chased.
Ludmila Staroustina tells how a historian came to them, begging to let him start excavation in the apartment.
And then convinced them to give them a place to live in exchange for his one-woman house on Oct. Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the story:
Where are we going in a quartet?
And there's a slight hope that they'll make the place more spacious.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Old Ones never won.
Ludmila's biggest dream was to get them moved, and they gave her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter a separate room.
So they've given two families a two-room apartment instead of the not-so-great ruins that two generations live in now.
A cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two small rooms of 23 square meters, called apartments, her large family lives.
We're seven people, two kids.
You can see the conditions.
The fabric falls off in pieces, like window frames, with through holes in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms.
The tap water is cold all year round.
If you walk through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can see that the lovers of the apartment No. 4 were the lucky ones.
They're the biggest rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
Room's 75 square feet, three people are booked.
We live in the same rooms where Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The floors are high, spacious.
One thing's wrong, it's all cracking up, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbors must have told you already!
The most painful things we had were the floors. The wooden boards were rotten, the ground was literally falling out of the ground.
I've got the supports, the clinch, there's nothing in the room yet, and in the other room we're walking like we're swinging, everything's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you more about the house of the merchant Evodokim Demidov than any tour guide.
He treats the goldsmith like he's his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the person was unusual: the owner of the Kagi and Ozyansk factories built houses, poured cannons and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs to the commercial real estate industry are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under one roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s", says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time, wooden wagon, horse-drawn wagon and guard booths were built around the building, which was later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to take our house down, but something stopped them.
The story repeated itself in 2014: they moved into a new home again.
We, as a team, gathered all the documents, searched the proper authorities, and suddenly we knew that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore.
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Residents didn't take it.
They would send from one table to another, and then, as a joke, they would issue a paper without a signature or stamp: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the displacement of residents".
I even got the feeling that our house hasn't been in the city for a long time, because it was number 57, then it became 57A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it was torn down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" has addressed the head of the information and analytical work sector of the Ufa Land Resources Administration, Vladimir Barabas.
The house at 57/1 Oct. Revolution Street is included in the old housing program.
I can't blame the officials for the 1970s, but I do know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value - is successfully executed.
Residents are expected to move into new apartments soon.
According to Barabas, the House of Demidov will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now an architectural biennale is being held in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The house will be decent, as it was three centuries ago.
The Demidov House will most likely become a museum open to anyone who wishes.
In addition, the government has decided to make the street pedestrianised on weekends.
Unfortunately, during the week, the city's roads are too busy.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same square as the current ones.
Just from another era.
In Primorye , a forest fire started due to the thunderstorm
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the area of the Hunting Forestry in the Pojar district of the Primorsky Territory.
The fire is being set up at the scene.
According to the KGSBU "Prior Air Base" leadership, the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
The fire, which broke out in a difficult-to-reach area, was discovered by a pilot-observer aboard an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood residues in an old burner.
The strong slopes and slopes of the slope are over 45 degrees, and the lack of landing-ready fireplaces create considerable difficulties in extinguishing them.
We need an Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the air base's existing forces by Mi-2 helicopters and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, 4 firefighters were immediately dispatched to the scene.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare a platform for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 firefighters were transported by helicopter to the village of Oshtnychy.
Once the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be transferred to the extinguishing site, the Primorsky Region administration website reports.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you".
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rare Reds of Rudy, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of Radio 4 broadcasts.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
Henry, however, had to deal with some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry received "a lot" of treatment, and he often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Get out of here!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket bat.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a shaky guy in the corner who's been reading the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to look back on what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoky, deep in the labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a pile of mud.
My dad went into the bathroom and he was just lying there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn our living, and I started to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you".
It wasn't until Mom got sick in the middle of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She 's a great mom .
They're still good friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the guys who killed her.
So when I got really, really well and I started to have symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take some radical action.
I then began to take a serious fitness class, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career change is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got critical acclaim for his Otello, he's been completely immersed in the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors and then by The Adventures of Augustus Wilson.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies that were an integral part of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces".
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black parody/comic on television".
He was studying at work.
I not only had to grow up in front of the audience, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975.
Since his manager had rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry found himself performing for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with crowds.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Playing characters who both mocked and praised the black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!.
His commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took him the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little like you're taking time or slowly turning away".
Then there was a documentary series on Radio 4 called "What's Good About...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say I was taught that much in school, and I thought it was mostly a middle-class white man's prerogative with a little cork and a cabbage on the bottom of the front.
So I was really scared of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't say that until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of the last of Othello's monologues for the documentary, and he got it.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"This is what it is, this is a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed like they were expecting a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Comedy of Mistakes".
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt his job was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You're gonna have to work 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the production would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in the play, stay in the role".
Henry in The Zapores at the Daches Theatre
It was hard to learn the lyrics for "The Grip".
Panic is pretty good, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, saying, 'This is what you should do.'"
He says it, of course, in a thunder voice.
So I'm sticking to this.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mindset, and all the way through our conversation, his flashes of humor interrupt him, and when he starts, he ends up parodying.
I just decided not to work in a standup shop because this thing with instant rewards from a room full of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do that, it could get stuck.
I work at Apollo Live sometimes when I want to, but I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever do a standup again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a fun time.
You always tell a story, and this is the perfect place for that.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "unseen workers"
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "unseen workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who fail to register within the next two weeks will not be paid more, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million a month was lost to payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that wages continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebussiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear within the next two weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government statement said.
Anyone who does not do so without a good reason will be removed from the payment log, it says.
"This procedure will significantly streamline the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government - thus ending the problem of 'non-visible workers,'" said Anne Weiguru, Cabinet Secretary for Planning and Struttering.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local news agencies reported.
Police officials did not immediately comment on the information.
Among those arrested were 14 senior officers, according to Hurriette Daily News.
Some of them participated in a corruption investigation last December that was aimed at investigating government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of organized crime and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power, by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children went back to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, the vast united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksand Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will learn what will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing sewn shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found the kind of impressive leader it needs.
She is followed by a slew of celebrities from the banking world, the media and the inner circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in executive positions.
She began her career at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued her career at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position at Pearson's head office was taken over by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tori advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox.
The board has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It's an almost unattainable duopoly that needs a complete radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in, smashing and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he lost his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
If it were not so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrinking in size - after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, unavoidable negotiations over the cost of a licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British are acquiring a stake in, without a doubt, the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its results cover 96 percent of households and cost them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it's obvious that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared with 31 percent 10 years ago.
The way I watch and use the BBC has changed: now I get the headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside the home.
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry's confirmed account Sunday night contained an offensive image of a Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, which de-favoured the video.
My account just posted a tweet that was written by someone outside.
"I disapprove of this tweet, and I removed it", the post reads.
Perry's aides didn't respond immediately to the messages asking for comment.
Although the footage was uploaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually posting the footage.
An earlier tweet featured a grim caricature of District Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who pleaded guilty to drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her agency when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The signature on the tweet reads, "I don't always drive a car drunk, three times the blood alcohol limit, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it".
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Bureau did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge conducting the case to dismiss the indictment, saying that the law that is being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history would be unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funding from the state's Public Utilities Department, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the public sector in Texas, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto has prompted an official complaint from a left-wing public-control group.
Perry's confirmed account tape is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
At the party's fifth Iowa convention during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by tweeting a photo of himself running by the lake and the words, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports the real estate market is back to "normal"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-east England had "returned" to normal activity.
Houses in the capital were in high demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from a peak in 2013", adding that this has provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market prospered during the recession as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stopped by new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "housing tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter lending conditions, would also result in lower market growth in both real estate transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling of the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its 2015 forecast for London real estate to 3 percent on the grounds that the real estate price trend is already beginning to weaken.
Transactions have since fallen by a quarter from the previous year in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales by over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgli added: "Demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have remained on schedule".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - nearly a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40 percent from the previous year to £380 million, income 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday at the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgeley said Berkeley's projected revenue for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the year-round profit before taxes is expected to be £450 million.
Berkeley's stock price stood at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked posted online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual American Film Academy Awards.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of 100 more rising stars.
A Star of the Hunger Games spokesman confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for "naked intrusion into private space".
There's been a law enforcement complaint, and they're gonna prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are authentic, though the "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" star, Winston, also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at the photos of me and my husband taking a few years ago alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's iCarly and Victoria the Winner denied that the photos were her, writing on Twitter: "These are so-called photos of me naked FALSHIVK, people.
Let me stop this in the germ.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's rep denied the photos she was allegedly in were authentic.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which has received critical acclaim
They dissolved, or rather, they were falling apart, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, too tense, too closed, and maybe a little annoying.
And then she shrugged his hand.
He saw the irritability.
He was a stick like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this scourge was a little romance from which he expected more than usual, relief from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomonz was a trembling fragile beauty with a twitchy hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Robben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a raw but paradise-like valley called the joyful "Paradise Valley".
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were running, the spiders were sitting still in the bath, the slime left its mark on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was filled with weeds that resembled giant goose bumps.
It was like a cottage in a children's book, both scary and charming, with a full-on secret garden.
Author's Opinion: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Keverne and Eileen sat, holding hands, in broken locks among high grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; they both dispersed to a cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he recalled an old song by a long-forgotten black performer his father loved to listen to as he lowered the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
Because of their inherent aggression, songs like this were never played on the console again.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually banned -- they just didn't lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste did what could never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people chose from books the memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
Enchanted by this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing the big legs of Eileen in a raw comic voice.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he told her, putting two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it slipped off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with the "J" and forget to put your two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz wasn't played either, although it wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was on people's nerves.
And jazz was a skill expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she could hardly remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and that meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude -- with gratitude to those who were saved by fate -- with the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people were well-versed in entertainment and sports - they sang and ran.
The people from India, who were naturally talented in electronics, made sure that no family was left without a working phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what remained of the Greek was the dishwasher.
The people of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country as quickly as what had been done, if it had been done, were afraid of being accused of setting the fire, of actually being consumed by the fire, and opened restaurants with labia and cassava, and were anxious for the futility of their work.
Each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung to her could even be put into music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could get through the soundproofing of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand it anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press his fingers on her lips again.
She already thought it was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
She nodded her head, unconvinced, closing Kevorno's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except a bunch of her spotted black hair.
Nothing he'd want to look at.
"Well, if you say so", she said, keeping her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too soon.
"I like you because you have thick ankles", he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led to embarrassing situations, because like his father, he lacked the calming charm that could soften the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good looks.
Eileen Solomonz turned red and got up from the lounge, flipping over the console and pouring the wine they were drinking.
Wine from the beard, so the drunkenness could not be his excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you're stupid", she said...
I don't like you.
He felt sorry for her, both for the excessive cruelty of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She hadn't told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was essentially like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after what they did, if they did more than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, roamed in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman who dared refuse or provoke them.
A fool's head?
They'd have shown her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First kissing - now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console issued - first kissing her and then hitting her.
It's too much to elaborate, Kevern thinks, because kissing itself was already a bullying.
Eileen Solomonz's body showed he needed to leave.
He got out of the lounge like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window, she watched him leave, her companion being a man who had taken on his own burdens.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sense of compassion for him and for men in general, although some of them raised their hands at her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, embarrassed, fighting, all the fighting ability left him - why did she think she knew this so well, if she could not remember any of the events to date when she saw this?
One of Eileen Solomons looked at her feet again.
Twenty years before or around the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnao, the informal public sentiment control agency, prepared a small report on the maintenance of low and medium levels of violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decline if not cease altogether, given the resources and efforts that were put into its eradication.
"Much has been done, and much is being done", she wrote, "to soften the innate aggression of the people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlements where, despite the floating churches over the gardens, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities seem to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, it seems, the lower the passions it generates.
The population is tearing down on sentimental ballads, swallowing stories about obstacles overcome and proclaiming their strong faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old cruelty retain its strong grip in rural communities and urban settlements, but there are also evidence that new and malicious predators are breeding in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have a nasty habit of writing too much", said her scientific director, after reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esmesbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
There's silence again.
"I ask", said Luther Rabinovich at last, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, which are completely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, like the ones you showed me.
You're obviously biased against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rough" would be interpreted by others as a natural expression of vitality and energy.
To continue to bore the country with what it has done, if it has done it all, as if it had happened, if it had ever happened, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esmesbaum looked around while Rabinovich spoke.
Behind his head, pink, flamingo-like, LED letters repeated the advice Offnau had given the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, a song is better than a written word; but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean", said Esme Nussbaum quietly, as she made sure her scientific director was finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we think we are.
What worries me is that if we're not prepared, we'll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to what we did, if we did it all over again.
Only this time we will not cast our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinovich connected the tips of his fingers to the pyramid.
This gesture was to mean endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "by calling the actions our grandparents made or did not make 'mistakes'.
You're going to go too far and talk about them throwing their "anger" and "disbelief" at "others".
If you were in your position, you wouldn't need a reminder that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we're not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no "us" and there was no "others".
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves", Esme dared to point out, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what was done is done.
That was then.
There's nothing more to say. We're all in this together.
And you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify yourself if it's appropriate or if there's anything you can do to fix it.
But what's the point of the past if it's not to learn -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I could add one word to that --
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovich has collapsed.
"I will consider your report", he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle rider who drove off the sidewalk, as the passersby described, "in a vicious rage".
Matches happen.
Lesotho's army says no coup was planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
The army of Lesotho denied the fact that a coup was planned to overthrow the government, saying that they were acting against the police, who they suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane has left the country, saying the country's army has surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had received a suicide threat.
Army spokesman Major Nttle Ntoi said there was no coup, but that the army was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces who are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to create chaos", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces are reportedly the main signs of a coup", he said.
Lesotho's army said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metzing is running the government in Taban's absence.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in his united government.
He claimed that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations of the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan rights at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
He only played three times for the London club last season.
We recall that Milan had previously leased from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest mark on the Eurozone manufacturing sector's business activity index (PMI) for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses were hit amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures were received before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
I would expect the bank to give me a clear plan on how to deal with the eurozone's recovery and the threat of deflation at inflation of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may give further signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to the ones used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more apparent", said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest in 11 months of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy in the bloc, France, PMI dropped to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy's weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that growth momentum is waning in mainly industrial engines, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence", Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to fuel the fires for analysts who are looking to introduce additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the euro area manufacturing sector's business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing".
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current rising geopolitical tensions - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit businesses - and consumers in particular - with confidence, and probably leads to some orders being delayed or even canceled, especially large orders.
He said that "it looks more like" the ECB will eventually have to make some sort of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited".
Mariupol residents will put up a live chain against the militiamen
Until last week, everything was calm in Mariupol - no one was reluctant to organize the Mariupol people's republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the militiamen.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would defend them, had little power against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and were about to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building blocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and they were chained to the streets, chanting the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same thing if they attack.
Volunteers collect and load up equipment and supplies, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
The city is gradually closing down shops, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the Beslan survivors: Ten years since the terrible takeover of the school, as the children who ended up in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school brutality.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of a school in Belarus, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors of the disaster were warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, kidnapped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in disgust, which surprisingly then grew into action and hope for the future in the midst of the greatest sorrow.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who had cheated on death during the school brutality.
We've found amazing young people who have endured adversity, even though the memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them are killed, will now end.
The girl in the photo trying to get back into the shooting gym
It's captured on a photo of famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, trying to get back into the bombed sports hall in one piece of underwear after a mine exploded.
Aida was desperate to find her mother, now in her 40's.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't", Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
I've got a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it", she says with defiance.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was to become my classmate, Djera Gapoev, was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the seizure stays with her, although the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and elsewhere.
When I see a picture of me walking out of a school window online, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a bullet hail, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven years old, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down and hold her hand if there was an explosion".
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and along the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through the bullet hail.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with leg injuries, thinking her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said: "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the defunct News of the World) where he was awarded the Barnardo's Children's Fund Protector Award by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Sherry.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it", he said yesterday.
I can tell you, though, that it's blurring in my memory.
I remember throwing all my toy guns away right after that.
But now I can play computer games with a shotgun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they're in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted and the drive in the open car.
But now he's afraid for places like Ukraine where wars lead to the kind of ordeal he and his friends have been through.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who are suffering from these horrors", said Damier, who volunteered at the women's convent last week.
I want to help.
I want to be a police officer someday and I hope to be accepted into the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were murdered in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the seizure, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damier.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can support us.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damier and me.
I remember when Damier wanted to eat a pork chop, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damier shooting them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still don't think the world has improved in the last 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine now, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like us.
I think for a lot of people, war is news reporting, which they listen to when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damier grew up to be a very gentle and calm boy, not at all aggressive or mean.
He's not looking for revenge, like he's not obsessed with that nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six of his classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I can't believe for hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked back, and I saw hell all around me, with body parts lying all over the place.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became the defining moment for the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and Georgi today on the right
His bloody face was a trace of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists entered the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmares", she recalled.
Not alone, there were family members of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's not a day that we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was long ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes from those days are all over me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It's a breath of fresh air: George's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanted to go to school so badly that he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a crying George sculpture in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photo makes people all over the world feel our pain.
George now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating these tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of a Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to be very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens because if you ask people, nobody wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
We need decades to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
I had nightmares about three or four years ago about being captured, but now I'm better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was really scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I'll remember that, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year and went to medical school in the Vladicaucasus.
I'm going to be studying to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not gonna happen.
Georgy Farnev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Amazing: Georgy Farnev was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the seizure, but he still managed to survive.
At the time of the seizure, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday", says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB but could not because of the damage to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say kids deal with bad things easily, but I have to say that's not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I wish I had forgotten.
In 2005, the following year, was the first and last time I ever went into this gym again.
I lost my mind.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in that famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farnev today with a laptop photo of himself in hospital after being captured
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm fine.
I need to be careful with my knee that's broken, but I'm walking fine now.
But my health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical records, and they said it couldn't be done.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals, from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something that kids should know, and it's certainly not something they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know George won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he's come back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several operations, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I'd say he's overcome that nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This awful experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the raid, and that only adds to my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children are born, but I know widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget the heart leaping from my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could just grab all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alya Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alyon Tskaev is being carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
She 's ten now (right), and she doesn 't remember the heinous crime at all .
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman took little Alyona out of a school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the school gym brutally.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, survived, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in a massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alana, now 10, has no memory of the capture and has grown into a bright and cheerful girl, the neighbors say.
"They are a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, said he was looking forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
He said this transfer is a joyful career event.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again", Kagawa quotes Bild as saying.
I feel very good.
I'm full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to being able to get back on the field in Borussia.
Remember, Kagawa moved to M.U. from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he never managed to establish himself in the English club, having played in just 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 resulting passes.
Man accused of hitting a girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear in court charged with the assault of a three-year-old girl at the Pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot a girl at the Pittenwyn crossing in East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied his guilt in Sheriff's Court in Dundee.
Sheriff Charles McNeir, the King's counsel, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande are not going to be in Vladivostok.
Duty Free's duty-free retail store at Vladivostok airport has posted a sign banning a number of world political leaders from shopping in the store.
Don't get mixed up in spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store's administration decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other prominent comrades would not be allowed to share vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And I hung a sign on the door.
Obama was previously banned from attending the less accessible institution - the MIT Dietary Dining Room, according to the food court website.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a dietary dining room in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the prohibitions seem to be terribly clever.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies to produce the cheeses that buyers demand.
The advice was given during a visit to the Yugpticeprom company of the firm "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised the restaurant owners to reorient themselves to Russian meat, which is of a high quality.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their level, "All sports" quotes Maslakov.
Third place is a confirmation of our high enough command level.
It's nice that the French and even the Americans have a minimal advantage over us.
We're not prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we're not obligating our leaders to participate in the DecaNation game.
In recent years, we have been runners-up in this tournament, but this season we have a new team.
The French, on the contrary, put out a fighting team, including 13 European champions.
They have not hidden their intention to win this year, as they have publicly announced many times.
But even this team of race owners could not resist the Americans.
So I think the Russians have performed at such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some categories were much lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Of course, the results are not so important to athletes anymore, especially in team competitions.
The point here was the place.
And the results, I agree, have made it absurd when men in the 1500 meters were so obsessed with the tactical tricks of running that they showed a lower-than-average result... in the women's race.
4 Tips on How to Get Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take a picture or video underwater, you have a number of equipment options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "mills", like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party with a couple of cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other units are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to fit the type of photos or videos you're shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for just five feet, others for 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because a lot of them don't work.
The "mills" have LCDs that help you compose the images, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have a HDD, it's hard to see underwater, and the framing is a random process.
So, do some shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode that takes multiple shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay at the surface when shooting in a pool, river or ocean.
It also allows you to transmit more color to the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Get closer to the filming location.
It's a great piece of advice for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the dark lighting.
Especially important if you're shooting with an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get closer to the shooting sites if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic bronze medalist in freestyle wrestling, Billal Makhov, could move on to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan national team for free wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is in the "classic" team, - quotes "R-Sport" from Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Bill was both of those in junior high.
At the 2005 World Junior Championships, he won the freestyle and third prize in the Greco-Roman events and decided to concentrate on the freestyle.
There's been talk for a long time that the next stage of our heavyweight career will be in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can play at the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the prank.
But the key word is always the coaching staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to helping patients both from the suffering of illness and from the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment are primarily concerned with something else entirely - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I did", he wrote in May last year.
I had a hard time finding strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself irritated by his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later", he noted.
When Juliet left for a week on business, Lawson found that he was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to do a chest x-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results are here.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters, dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it's hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
Britain is, it turns out, at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people are dying of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're feeling the lethal effects now is that although asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
And the mesothelioma attack is not limited to industrial construction veterans.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, deposited in the homes we live in, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not take into account class, wealth, occupation, or age.
The bastions of the elite, from London's fashion department stores to private schools, turned out not to be a salvation.
The Parliament building is covered with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have become tanks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe-insulator.
Actually, he had to figure out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he got smart.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years as an intern", he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors and freighters used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers have the same disease?
It was a question he unfortunately could answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have developed mesothelioma in the past five years", he noted in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one who has survived".
How many of us have this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die within eight months of being diagnosed.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us have the same disease?"
According to the UK's leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the UK asbestos epidemic is expected to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't know they're going to die like this.

A quick look at the courtroom reports, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen had been exposed to asbestos by accident.
She worked at the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She has two children over 20 now.
"Before it happened", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I never thought I'd be affected by it.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word asbestos, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today than any other.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are strong, though indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK]".
Marks & Spencer employee exposed to asbestos at the company's flagship store on Oxford Street, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when no known exposure at work or home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Much of this, he says, is due to "the usual use and weather" of our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the very center of government, could be unconsciously exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines outside the parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be moved by something as harmless as "strong air currents".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament Service Directorate insisted that Westminster Palace had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it now acknowledged that £1 billion of work needed to be done to rebuild the Parliament, improve electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament may be meeting at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on Westminster's green benches.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not governed by various rules".
It's impossible to tell if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of the people who never found contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that successfully filed asbestos lawsuits", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December of 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late that night.
Suddenly, I started to get a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The doctors took chest x-rays and put pleural catheters in to draw fluid from the lungs and send it to the chest for analysis.
And yet his condition was undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott didn't link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT and X-ray results to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into a hole between his chest lining and his lung lining.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But my wife, Rachel, was worried.
The biopsy came back a week between Christmas and New Year, and I was told it was a mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbot suddenly got into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, and one of them suggested he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common", he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
So mesothelioma now strikes younger people with non-typical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so patients are unlikely to be harmed.
But many employees who walked through the tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly were exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were theoretically a place to save lives for patients, but a place that was life-threatening for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The students were setting their Bunzen burners on asbestos supports
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its amazing insulation and fire resistance.
So are the schools.
In fact, many of them were probably exposed to asbestos for the first time in their classroom.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, students would install their Bunzen burners on asbestos pads.
Web sites have emerged that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless items such as floor tiles or shed roofs were usually asbestos.
"It's industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings", says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful, you're going to tear down the garden shrimp.
The effect of a diagnosis when a disease is known to be incurable is enormous.
"It takes a long time to realize that", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was moving from a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to take.
"It was hard to make sense of it", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
That's it.'"
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it's the mechanics of how we sustain life - the act of breathing itself - that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhalation of asbestos needle fibers", says Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It was the same hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now ironically the leading center for mesothelioma treatment.
Trevor knew Lawson and treated some others who may have been exposed while interning at the hospital.
When asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treger says, "the breath pushes them out to the periphery of the shell.
It's basically an invasive process from the beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treasurer doesn't agree.
"You can't cut the pleura", he says.
It's impossible to move a knife around her.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not perform well with chemotherapy", which "works" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are patients who live long", says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he developed mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became the sole provider of support and counseling for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Center", he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "tryed to give the whole thing a slightly more positive color".
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loïc Lange-Lazdonski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"The advantage was that I didn't need directions, I just called them and they accepted me", admits Graham.
The average patient would need to get directions and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to get the best available treatments.
However, when such treatment is ultimately found to be ineffective, many sufferers face another financial reason to worry - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could be a health risk.
That's when we talked about the company's bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement", Morgan said, as Lawson was unable to prove unambiguously that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement rooms mentioned was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying deadly asbestos to a company or workplace - usually decades later - has been a major problem for mesothelioma patients who need compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed hands or closed.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not.
In response, this year, serious new legislation has been introduced that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was set up for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits are expected under this scheme each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is "a very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers", he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time interval had not been intervened and mesothelioma patients could track the companies and file lawsuits the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Secretary of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People are suffering so badly, and they need help today", Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loïc Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Ladzunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy in which Lange-Ladungski boasts a whopping 40 percent of patients surviving within five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"It's certainly one of the most important things", Abbott says.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's a force that's holding you back.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were a few stains in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not a life-threatening thing.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of any tumors now.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things, like finances when I die, for example, or showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
This kind of conversation is something every cancer patient has to deal with.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of survival.
This disease carries with it (even, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not a life-threatening condition.
The bodies of the nabal-shaped pharaohs wrap themselves in asbestos.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now we've invented a canvas that doesn't burn.
I saw the napkins made of it melting in the fireplace at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heat insulator for the Industrial Revolution's steam engines and turbines.
World asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential's statistics show an early death rate among those who work with asbestos and are denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were, without question, the primary cause of death".
This is the first case of this kind.
The owners of Kershaw, Turner Bros. Asbestos, have denied any liability.
Compensation is not paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding was rapidly developing, one of the deadliest professions in terms of exposure to asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on blue asbestos imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by exposure to asbestos in the UK.
World asbestos production is growing to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The UK's Health and Safety Executive Committee requires all contractors working with asbestos to obtain a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act has been passed in the UK.
A compensation scheme of £350m has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at about 2 million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to kick off the long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the People's National Assembly, in essence, allows the communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It's not a disappointment, but it's still a rage", said Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They've deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it's obvious that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said allowing a popular run for the Hong Kong leadership would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to elect a head of government by ballot, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders described Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer of some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the wave of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement "was considering the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the dialogue possibilities are exhausted and there is no other option.
We regret to report that all the possibilities for dialogue are now exhausted and the capture of the central district will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and on Sunday security measures were tightened at the government headquarters, with police and barricades being deployed.
The unrest is rooted in the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition in the goods and services sector.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put at risk Hong Kong's vital business.
"The protest they're talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long", said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
It's a concept that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong's democratic activists have been depicted as being driven by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal voting rights referendum that drew 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people marched to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American culture of graduation balls reaches university life: freshmen are offered to come by private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a bright impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is a perfect alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that as the service has just been launched, no orders have yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also said that while students are required to pay £9,000 a year for their education, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NCS vice president for higher education, said: "This project seems incredibly cut off from the lives of most students.
Many students who start college this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when the available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rapidly growing expenses on basic needs before they can even begin to think about spending thousands of pounds on something like a simple boarding pass.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson .
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The crowd raises their hands, shouting, "Hands up, don't shoot", while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and gained national attention, Perez saw white women's responses that focused 100 percent on racial affiliation.
Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Things about Ferguson from a white woman's perspective" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they've shown a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level", she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because it's so tied to race, they felt they needed to point it out.
For Coretta Mitchell Ferguson, a professor of English at Ohio State University, she exposed the problems that black Americans face every day, but that are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell says.
When I write about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, silence blurs the lines.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships in public but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and almost always the rape of a white woman was the basis", said Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's perspective, the gap between white and black women came about when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for suffrage would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of women's suffrage, and the black suffrage was supposed to come later", Hattery said.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything right.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group was formed almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's perspective, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the problems that black women had faced for generations.
"Would it be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
Two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll demanding that white Americans take more part in racial protest.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will be at the forefront of change", Stine wrote.
Although Steinem advocates a more intersecting feminism that includes issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict her earlier criticism.
We have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women now, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, Watch My Brother, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is advancing the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that to present the issue as important to women, she needed only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], the women who come with them are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are being answered by women's organizations", she said.
Ipswich house with the pigs for sale
A photo of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was discovered that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120000, a single-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photo of the living room of the house - a pig with his head lying on the couch.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed", a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as "a unique single-bedroom detached house".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it still remains in the advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost the fourth round of the US Open to Karolin Wozniaksky, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, reports from New York Vasily Osipov.
How do you overall rate your results at this year's Grand Slam?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I didn't have enough stability, especially in the end of some matches.
I'm obviously upset right now.
I couldn't even make it to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After a disappointing defeat, I have a huge motivation to take it to the next level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year well.
The Asian series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma's Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses for GTO's compliance with the norms when entering the universities.
He said the regulations would be the same as they were in the Soviet era, people would be giving up rules for pulling, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 Russian subjects will start implementing GTO standards on their territory from September 1.
I also offered to give bonuses to students who have submitted GTOs when entering higher education institutions", said Valuyev.
For example, you can add a little bit of score to the E.G.E.
There are also proposals to give additional leave to employees of enterprises that have passed these sporting tests.
In the town of Harvey in South Wales , a new millionaire appears after winning the lottery
The lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought in southwest Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from a Saturday night lottery draw.
The Harvey Newsstand is bringing home gold in the grand prize for the second time in five years, with the last win coming in at $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everybody's really excited.
We thought that winning like that could be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated their grand prize wins last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, the Kenning Vale player was named one of the five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win by a Belmont couple just weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and said that the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
Harvey's millionaire brings the number of winners of the Western Australian Grand Prix to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov told the "Vedomosti" roundtable at the Moscow Auto Salon - 2014.
The plan was developed on the orders of the government, and one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, Pluginov said, and the proposed measures concern electric cars and hybrids - the plan for developing vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available at Vedomosti) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid vehicles will be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A government report outlining the tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a preferential lending and leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulatory legal acts to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, auto refueling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages when moving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - proposals to expand state procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of clean transport, the development of charging infrastructure in the list of indicators for evaluating the activities of regional authorities.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013 about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts Mitsubishi Motors' chief executive director in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But even five-fold growth does not make electric cars any more noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company is focused primarily on corporate customers, says Renault's director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia, Nikolay Remiz.
Most other electric vehicle manufacturers have been waiting for Russia.
Russian manufacturers have electric vehicles, but they are not producing much.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the ASM-holding, "AutoVAZ" produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, says Sergey Amanov, director of AutoVAZ's engineering department, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, besides the cost of cars (the electric cars sold in Russia are on average twice as expensive as those with internal combustion engines) is holding back the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (fuel stations - units), says Autostat's general director Sergey Celikov.
Due to the high cost and low cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, forecasts the editor-in-chief of "Autorevyu" Mikhail Poдорожанsky, and the goal is to be consistent.
Carmakers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated by the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes BMW Group President in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rossetti": several stations have been built in Moscow, and soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations are also underway with other regions on the construction of the gas station network.
According to Rosseytes' director Vladimir Sofian, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, the network company Rossetti does not have the right to sell electricity, and is working on the possibility of doing so in relation to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia to be the elimination of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, the extension of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transportation taxes in Russia are low, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, there are also incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), believes Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles through designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
Private plane crashed in Colorado.
Piper PA-46 single-engine plane crashed in Colorado, USA.
Three of the five people on board were killed, reports Itar-TASS.
Survivors are being taken to the hospital.
The accident happened a few miles from the Denver airport runway.
The cause of the tragedy is being determined.
In Donetsk region, the prisoners of the Donbass battalion are being treated.
The Karateers were surrounded by the Iloway.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of law enforcement officers were killed in shelling.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in southeastern Ukraine really is, they would not have gone to war.
108 of the prisoners are lucky.
The Donbass battalion's cadets survived the meat-cutting they were hit with near Ilovaisk.
The militants spent several days surrounding the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, which were effectively abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters told them that the ring could be exited through the supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But within minutes, shells and bullets were whistling from all sides.
"According to the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave", says the deputy commander of the battalion, who has the Lermontov call-up card.
And as we got down to the bottom between Multipolye and Chervonoselsky, crossfire started with anti-tank guided missiles, "Zuch", 30-millimeter grenades, automatic BMD guns, sniper rifles.
Four cars went ahead and three behind me, leaving only two cars.
The officer with the Lermontov call-up says that at least 60 people were killed almost immediately, dozens were wounded, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and blamed them for a true death.
They say we were betrayed.
The column, the entire battalion, to destroy it.
Like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered for the Donbass battalion, as Ukrainian news reports reported atrocities allegedly committed by "separatists" in the southeast.
Alexy has seen a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was a shelling, that it was probably Ukrainian forces", one of the soldiers, Alexei, said.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They didn't let us out of Illinois, they said we were in a ring.
I've already made an appointment with the commander, I've already written the report on the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from Zurachovo.
According to the prisoners, 300 to 350 people were trapped in the boiler near Ilovay.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would never have joined the punishment battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR.
Everyone will be tested for war crimes.
The region has established a headquarters for food prices
In Krasnoyarsk, a headquarters has been set up to limit the rise in food prices in the region.
The order to create this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the county government, representatives of the executive and supervisory authorities.
They'll all be together to monitor the prices of agricultural products in the countryside.
Do you think that Russia will compensate Russia's Russian oil company for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said the company estimated the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk nuclear power plant in Ukraine at $140 million.
He told Spiegel in an interview.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation", Sechin said.
According to him, the company's modernization of the Lisichansk NPP was planned to be put into operation in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fights, no 'rebels digging', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technology oil pumped into the pipes is missing", he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk oil refinery, a tank for storing oil burned and two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk NPP is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first line of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichany refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the "Euro-4" standard, as well as diesel fuel of the "Euro-5" standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisich NPP was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft acquired Lisich NPP together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, the incident occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
According to the Interfax Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble is falling amid geopolitical pressure
The dollar rose to 37.15 rubles at the Moscow stock exchange, while the ruble dropped to the bi-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
The ETS dollar trading started with transactions in the range of 37,11-37,2 rubles/$1, and in two minutes the average price was 37,16 rubles/$1, which is 4 kope higher than the previous closing.
The euro price was 48,79 rubles per euro, three cents higher than the previous closing.
The price of the bi-currency basket increased by 3.5 cents and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading 23 cents higher than the official exchange rate, the euro 16 cents higher than the official exchange rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, August 29, but there was no panic this time.
He kept the ruble cheaper and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But for now, it's more like artificial hysteria being spread through the media, especially Western media.
There are not many options for new sanctions against Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow stock exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see any new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the national currency positions may be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be sued by the Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed a lawsuit against Ideal-Tour for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
There are two cases that will be heard in October.
There will be different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
It's a little over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on August 18.
It's worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 2.
As reported to journalists in the Russian tourism industry union, judges are appointed different.
In July, the media reported on the debt of 1,5 billion rubles to the Ideal-tour.
Victor Zukin, the airline's CEO, says the amount is 1.6 billion rubles.
The director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, says that the sum is even higher - two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to make it more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblogging service has changed the user registration process to get new users more quickly involved in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandon their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be able to browse through a large number of accounts recommended by the service when they register to create their own read-circle.
Recommendations are based on the interests indicated when registering.
Twitter automatically sets a subscription bar for all the accounts that are automatically selected.
This will require the user to remove the columns themselves to avoid reading those that are not of interest to him.
If users of the microblogging service used to only see the avatar of recommended users, now Twitter is taking a sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help create an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter's registration page in three years.
Twitter has been actively working on upgrading the service recently.
This activity is primarily due to the ongoing efforts of the service to achieve profitability.
In 2014, the microblogging service was faced with a slowdown in user base growth and a decline in readership activity.
The company is desperate right now for more loyal consumer resources that, once in, would last.
This is the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising.
Moscow's knowledge day will be bright and rainy
On September 1, the weather forecast is clear and rainy throughout the day.
The temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
In cloudy, clearer weather, the winds will be moderate, with winds of just 3 to 8 meters per second.
The program of utilizing cars has been renewed since September 1
From 1 September, the program for the recycling of cars in Russia is resumed.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other support directions.
The program will cover all cars over the age of six.
The compensation amount will be from 40 thousand for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo car.
Earlier, a similar program of car recycling was already in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is not only expected to use the cars for subsequent discount, but also the possibility in case the car reaches the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when handing over the old one to the "trade-in" from the dealer, reports "Interfax".
The previous federal program of utilization, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, spent over 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the production level of light cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million pieces (this is a plus 101,4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator is releasing a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for his game Coming Out Simulator, has decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only now that it's become widely known.
The inspiration for the game came from events in Ferguson, where protests are ongoing, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has yet to be named, will be how news coverage affects the consequences of stories.
The hero of the game, the civilian journalist, will have to photograph what's happening in the areas where clashes between police and the population are taking place.
The hero can take different photos of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he takes a scene that makes the cops look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where no ordinary person can.
If he does not cover the events, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive uprising.
The game's points will need to be scored using the hero's Twitter account, which will add new followers if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how the photo is made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of the game for quite some time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the events.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This biographical game is about a bisexual teenager trying to tell his relationship to his homophobic parents.
Geletey is drawing Ukraine into the bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was paid to the words of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Gelety, who declared that "the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" had been completed and that "the Great Patriotic War" had begun, which would have cost "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who posted the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists outside the military field", - said the Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements could belong to the defense minister of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian Defense Minister wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us".
At the same time, he declared that "the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine" was completed.
Through Hilton, he deleted all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized.
Today, the horror has swept over 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data warehouse) on smartphones, and their intimate photos were posted on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
It's true, not for long.
Recall that the official spokesperson for the star of the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, has already reported the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all the photos that "shine" on the Internet are authentic.
Through Hilton, the creator of the tabloid website of the same name, he apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the workshop for posting their candid photos, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do it.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice", the blogger tweeted.
However, all the outspoken photos of the stars have already flown through the Internet.
David Beckham was in a car accident hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident while escaping from a paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at the corner of Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer suffered a stroke and a sprained right arm.
Beckham came out of the tattoo parlor where the paparazzi were waiting for him.
He escaped their pursuit on a motorcycle and failed to make it past the steering wheel and fell, TMZ reports, citing sources close to the footballer.
As a result, Beckham suffered a fracture, a sprained right arm and a scratch.
Tony Stewart is in a car accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track was completed just over halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke at the 172nd lap, ending his performance.
Stuart drove his car to the garage and then left without talking to reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said the 14 members of the team are upset, but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him", said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll be better off there.
Stewart first hit a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush that required repairing the right side of his car.
"I started today with quite a high hope of successfully coming to the finish", said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Soon after the second accident, Stewart's car was sunk into an evacuator, and the team was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed another driver during a race on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Chase.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to express displeasure with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash will continue for at least two more weeks.
A decision on whether to indict Stewart was not made.
The three-time champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was represented before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on the 122nd lap after the restart, Bush's number.
Car 18 went off the trajectory at exit turn 2 and hit Stewart, pushing both cars against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st.
Sobchak and Vitorgan are having a cigarette breakfast with Jwanecki in Odessa .
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host did not miss to report on her Instagram.
It's true, one photo surprised and confused the couple's fans.
The picture was taken by Zwanecki.
"At Mikhail Mikhail Jvanetski's breakfast, Maxim explains what is an Instagram:)) #odessa", - signed the photo by Ksenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no bread, no butter, and nothing else.
The couple's fans thought that Kshusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?", "Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) ", "It looks like breakfast, and only cigarettes))) ", "Xenia, you smoke too?", - her blog followers were excited about her favorite.
Recall that recently Sobchak boasted about the delicious dinner Maxim Vitorgan prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the farm, and your husband has prepared dinner for you (for the first time in your married life, so delicious. The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner, he doesn't say the words from the joke:"that every day is like this now", - boasted her husband Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows Maxim working hard to cook, and there's already salt and fried chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from across Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the country's capital Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to restore the old working conditions that had recently been changed.
The increase in wages is also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the acting justice minister, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding that the old 24-hour shifts be returned.
Although the prison workers' union has met with the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement has been reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, the head of the BNR's chief executive, Rosen Zheliazkov, said.
The prison workers' union is expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Internal Affairs Workers' Unions.
The army controls Thailand's new government
General Prayat (right) appointed the government of Wongswan (left) as defense minister
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet of ministers, which will be filled by more than a third of the generals or retired generals.
The army's representatives were given key positions: defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade ministers.
On Monday, Praut Chan-ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the Thai king officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man who seized power in the country in a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected prime minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army has appointed parliamentarians.
According to Praut Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of protests demanding the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Chynawat.
Officially, Praut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army removed Chief Minister Yinglik Chinwat Taksin from office.
Both are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has ensured them success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital's elite joined the anti-government movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that salad of middles would be better, I didn't promise you that, says a waitress from the new Palm bracelet.
It's a formal recognition that it is, but the mind and stomach remain unchanged.
Because everybody knows for a long time that we say "Belgium" - we mean media, we say "media" - we mean Belgium.
Restaurants like to say that the success of a restaurant depends on three factors: location, location, and again location.
There are places that are not so well-positioned, but even great, but some are unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a cafe called "The Town" (after the same TV show), then "Odexa-Mamma", and then a restaurant called "Bogole" and a beer called "Friendship".
Now it's beer again, but not nostalgically Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg was above the ground: a bar stand and a couple of tables, and all the rest of the space was devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like in a nursery: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs where the girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long been out of fashion, so there's nothing to compare.
There are eight types of distilled beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A company-positive waitress presents the menu with a funny story, saying that "the media is a big seed", and it's worth noting that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Who, for example, can foresee that a meat roulette with a ballon blackberry (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio cut so thin that a parchment paper will look ugly thick in comparison to it.
You can only taste something if you're holding half a plate together.
The salad's worse.
Classic Liege (260) would be the right thing to say about a crime against the Belgian people: some rusty iceberg, a potato cooked a long time ago, a wide-shaped Kenyan bean, a red-hot bacon chip and some marinoated onion.
You wouldn't want to meet anyone with a lettuce like that!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were somewhat different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to the unripe fourths of black tomatoes or the fried champagne, why do the middies look like they've been frozen and boiled several times in their lifetime?
I know there are quite normal white-sea mites here!
They are served in pots "in a sauce of your choice" (RUB 490-560 for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, it's not really a good idea.
Vegetables are eaten, but the aroma is missing, and whether there was wine is a mystery.
But the good ones rely on the middles of homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not a loaf of bread, thick enough that depending on your mood, you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice butter soup.
It was reported that the rabbit was cooked in a beer sauce by a local chef, and there was no mention of rosemary.
The situation was diametrically opposite: the rosemary stifled everything.
It was thought that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his lifetime, which is why the meat has such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit's leg was attached to a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm waffles are not only sweet but also full-bodied - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The pineapple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager came to the table and asked very informally about the lunch impressions.
Then you should come back.
The dollar has risen to over 37 rubles on the news of the West's preparation of new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historic record.
The dollar rose by 26.9 cents to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 cents to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow stock exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 cents to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its peak on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36,43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both in the euro and in the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this, says senior analyst Anna Bodrova of Alpari.
Everything about Ukraine will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, the rumors of the invasion are unconfirmed by either side, but the market has turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk of him being resilient to this kind of news was cut yesterday.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in one chain.
Inflation is also forecast to spike: to current prices in the fall will increase by 5 to 10%.
Soon, the seasonal fruits and vegetables will be over, and a vacuum will be created as the networks reorient to other suppliers.
"The dollar came close to the 37-ruble mark, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysteria", comments Konstantin Bushev, head of the market analysis department of "Opening Broker".
It remains to be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, he said, has weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then news has spread across Ukraine, and the Central Bank last week said it was moving to a floating rate by the end of the year and refusing any foreign exchange intervention.
If you look at the daytime fluctuations, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was scared by the 37 rubles mark, - continues the analyst.
Well, nothing powerful happened in terms of turnover.
The currency market was in trouble at the end of January when the demand for the currency was high, and on March 3 when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the ruble's weakening.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue share of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through the increase in the price of imports, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
The price of imported goods and services is also a negative factor.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, become a cause of the increase in the cost of borrowing money, which in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
Speaking of the stock market, the devaluation of the ruble slightly smooths down the share price, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell 1.67 percent on Thursday, and the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.
This significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble over the course of the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is of an emotional nature and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually fade away, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We think we will soon be able to see the dollar and Russian currency ratio close to the level of 36 rubles per dollar", says Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The Brit reported that she spent many years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Carin Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Tuta disease (STM), a group of inherited disorders that cause damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with MS because so little is known about the condition.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have MST, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain gait and pressed toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's Ataxia, a condition that was very bad for her.
Rogers thought she'd be in a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and dead before she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do what others could.
I fell every day, and I had more time to do things.
I never could skate or skate with other kids, and I was often mocked at school for walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical chart when her doctor left the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty for sticking my nose where it wasn't meant to be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library, and wrote to the AA", she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and I experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I'd gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something that's a much less life-threatening thing.
After a few genetic tests, she was found to have an STD.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I had pulled out a lucky ticket", she said.
The UK's charity STI has announced a month of information on STI to try to raise awareness of the disease.
The tax burden on Washington-area entrepreneurs is increasing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country have increased moderately in the past year as the economy has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in total to the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on businesses at the state and local level increased 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year in a row for growth after years of declining bills in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
The increase in tax revenue is largely driven by a return to the previous levels of real estate value of companies, the researchers say, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of this revenue is generated in large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same thing is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up $9.6 billion from 2012, a 4.2 percent increase from the year before.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organizations that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the state's Tax Center.
So Maryland has to rely a lot more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also seem to be improving, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared state-level corporate income tax at $2.3 billion, up $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average of 4.3 percent, while Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenue rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county, it's relatively high, at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia had lower taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local levels and, overall, a more favorable climate for entrepreneurs in terms of taxes than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor in the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering corporate rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes at the state and local levels, according to a recent study.
The entrepreneurs' taxes paid by small business owners as individual income taxes - the transitional structure that most small businesses are structured under - in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than the corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say the trend and growth in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with revenue from turnover taxes in state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The world championship in judo at home brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze medals.
According to this indicator, the Russians have only lost to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese national team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and on the first day brought the Russian team the silver medal.
Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the 60 kg category, won the title.
In the same final fight with Mongol Baldbaatar Ganbat, the outcome of the confrontation was resolved by only one comment received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, the silver medal was won by Mikhail Puliyev, and the bronze medal was won by Kamal Han-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinu.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarterfinals, won the consolation tournament and won the bronze medal.
In the women's 52 kg category, Natalia Kuzutina also reached the third stage of the honor podium.
In the semi-final, she lost to the current world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze contest, Kuzytina won against Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, the obstacle to the Russian woman's gold was Kelmendy, who had defeated Kuzytina in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the 73 kg category, placed bronze in the Russian national team's purse.
In the quarter-finals, he was offended by former Moldovan representative Viktor Skvortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov was playing at home with a foot injury, which he plans to heal soon, so he will take a break from competitions.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who has taken on the sporting citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko, finished with a bronze in the 100kg category.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontsov won in the 81 kg category.
In a heavy battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmidt by the remark of his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were held, but Russians traditionally only won one bronze in the men's event, which was limited to 90 kg.
It was won by Kirill Issues, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his compatriot Kirill Denisov was his opponent in the consolation final.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent of Vospov could not get out on the podium due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put into the collection of the national team by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation-filled final, he won a clean sweep over Brazilian David Morea.
That's how the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both the men's and women's Russian national teams were among the main contenders for the awards, but as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were unlucky - they did not reach the medal.
And now the Russian judo players have won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they ceded the main favourites of the competition - the Japanese team - in a hard-fought struggle with a score of 2-3.
At the same time , the Russian national team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and Denis Yartsov (weight up to 73 kg).
However , in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals , Murat Habachirov (81), Mohammed Mohammedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope .
The same scenario was followed by a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian national team, leading 2-0, lost 2-3 to the Japanese.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk, Russian President Vladimir Putin attended, who after the tournament ended congratulated the men's national team with silver.
"The second place is very honourable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions", Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
Losing the Japanese, the originators of judo, is nothing shameful.
But I'm sure you can win.
The Russian national team performed much better at the world championship than a year ago at similar level competitions held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all big maximalists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if a man in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, he's a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in such a sport as judo", - concluded the tournament sports minister Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merit, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will be held in the summer of next year in Astana.

The Joanne Rivers family is hoping for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving in a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're hoping for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had suffered cardiac arrest at a hospital in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and close supervision until they can satisfy her "severe" condition.
The response was broad, including extensive online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montell Williams and Kelly Ripp.
All kings can .
The band's debut album Royal Blood is a new hope for British rock, which has driven rock duos from clubs to stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has been on the scene for a year, but they've already been nominated for a BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert grooming room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current unfortunate situation in the music market, it's a bit of a shock, because it's not the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-talking representative of the new R'n'B, but a British-looking bullfighting duo playing with the same level of loudness and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album were particularly high due to all the above circumstances and were already justified.
The duo has made a name for themselves, which could be attacked by the most desperate metalworkers, and the blood of kings they think is in their veins is also obvious.
It's, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is aiming to shake the blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.
It may be too early to predict the success of this enterprise, but something can be said.
Ten songs in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by being remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum set.
Musicians joke that this song is actually easier to beat than to sing.
It's also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
The truth is, though, that each of these songs will sound great at a hard rock party, but when played back-to-back, they're more or less on the same canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even if it's the other way around.
Royal Blood's strength is that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney accolades (they are aiming for the successors of Motörhead), but have pulled numerous rock duos out of ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite its diversity, is made for stadiums, in a space designed for less than a couple thousand people, and it's obviously tight.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented in the early '0s by The White Stripes.
It's not just the instruments, though, it's the songwriting approach itself.
The heroes of the retro-zero-world were hardly selected outside the postmodernist paradigm, and were reluctant to acknowledge themselves as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and aggressive that it's successfully dragging some of the secondary and hardness of the music.
After all, who said rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: An online store - and a video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying Twitch's streaming video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for a good billion dollars looked like it was done, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set itself the goal of being a universal streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; "YouTube for games in real time", according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And let's play, a genre of video games where all-ages give (mainly old) games processing, like in Mystery Theater, is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted tech company buying off a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay at least as much as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster".
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to be better at sports than watching it, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick.
It's one thing to watch a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. crawling through Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 consecutive shots to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling your own angle of view can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passes that Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not a game or a sense of humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and it's the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to make money on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would roll into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: a bunch of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch chief Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and this channel shows no signs of slowing down, even - oh - as a sport of show business.
In 2004, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Almost all of the students, the parents of the dead, the guardian of the cemetery in the City of Angels, Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the "Mothers of Beslan" committee, Susanna Dudieva, who was a member of the emergency services, spoke to the survivors - says Elizabeth Antonova, a correspondent from the Society department who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the president's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Russian FSB "B" management officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What struck me most during my work on this topic was that Beslan seemed to have been missing for ten years.
This is a very painful subject for anyone who has anything to do with it, people who are hardly willing to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we have done our job", Antonova said.
The special project is being prepared by the Rambler & Co. infographic studio, which has been working with the company since the spring of this year.
Previous projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's time in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports Renhap.
The launch was made around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative succeeds, Russians' data will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The draft law on the date of entry into force of the law on personal data of Russians has been moved from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower house.
It was written by the members of the State Duma Vadim Daygin, Yaroslav Nilow (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Justice Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and the observance of the secret of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which is in the process of being implemented by parliamentarians, requires the Russian authorities to keep personal data of Russians processed via the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, clarify and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnazorg the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation in the field of personal data on the basis of a court decision.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of infringing sites - an automated information system called "Registry of infringers of personal data subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugova and Vadim Daygin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
The current draft law on the date of entry into force of the already adopted law is also authored by Daygin and Yushchenko.
Those who don't have data centers in Russia will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the draft law, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said he saw no problem with the date of the entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, companies that will not have their own personal data storage facilities on the territory of Russia by January 1, 2015 will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to rent their servers and already provides their servers, Mail Group, Western companies that already provide their servers today".
"In addition, there are several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this area", he added.
"If the companies decide to comply with the law and continue to operate in the Russian Federation, I don't see any problems - they will get technological opportunities to place", Levin said.
The controversial bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, online booking of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to dispose of their own data, imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The REAK statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is being made, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, the person can choose the territory on which the action is to be carried out.
The adoption of similar laws on "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the disappearance of global services and significant economic losses.
A test participant with a bucket of ice water has a jaw twitching
Isabel Roberts in Britain was shouting when she was rubbed with ice water on her head, damaging her facial bone structure.
This ice water test went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so loudly during a test of ice water that her jaw came out.
Isabel Roberts was screaming so furiously when she was poured ice water on her head that it damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold, I was screaming, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck", she told The Mirror.
They're pouring water on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident .
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't shut, it was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister came to the same realization and started to groan, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to hospital for a jaw correction after taking part in a popular pastime on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation and was posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossiya claims to have shot down a Ukrainian Su-27 and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
The militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side as of 10:00 a.m. on September 1, 72 of them wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead military personnel.
This was reported to Interfax by the representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that "air defense forces shot down a Su-27 aircraft in the area of the village of Mereshki, violating the ceasefire agreement".
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used the international conventions prohibited cassette ammunition during the artillery shelling of Lugansk airport.
The spokesman of the press service noted that the militiamen managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force in one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armored vehicles and two armoured warehouses.
"The enemy's live force lost up to 100 people killed and wounded, 13 people were captured", the headquarters representative said.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed forces of the Donbass "people's republics" announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side of 223 captured military personnel and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine within the framework of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, the DPR army, according to the Army of Novorossiya, "overtook the attempts of the national guards to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area in violation of previous agreements".
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupolsk) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel was surrounded by militiamen in the Ilovysk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian military personnel from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrender weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semenchenko, 14 more people came out of the "boiler" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "captured by 137 regiments of the 32nd Russian Division and 9th Russian Tank Brigades", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Defense have denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take countermeasures in case of new sanctions imposed by the EU
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said the European Council's conclusions of 30 August showed the EU's inability to overcome the inertia of its unambiguous support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven claims about the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of this country", the ministry's website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is being influenced by countries interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing sides", the agency stresses.
The ministry's website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has occurred, and the number of civilian casualties is increasing.
It is planned to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against Russia during the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU officials work closely with US officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures introduced by the period of application and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government has also announced expanded sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
The smart ways to save money on university textbooks
And while college textbooks cost more than $1,000 a year for many students, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move to the second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system for hiring books from high school students, offering them a nominal compensation to put off selling them.
"My math book, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie", says 19-year-old Schroeder, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The literature needed for the past semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to cut those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the spring semester, says Trevor Meyer, vice president of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buy in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's Mathematical Analysis costs about $290 a preview, but the new copy is available for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Purchasing used
If you're not against other people's marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical analysis is for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of the textbook "Strategies for Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising".
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Brasey, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, suggest students ask their professors if they can't use previous editions.
Sometimes updates aren't important to the class.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
The rental
When renting a textbook, you should consider whether you are good enough to handle it, remember to return it and keep it after the course.
You can save more than 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a semester of Mathematical Analysis for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines you may be charged for marks, emphasis, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you don't return the book, the fines can even exceed the cost of a new copy.
The e-books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are rented out for a specific period of time by purchasing an electronic license from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The six-month lease on Chegg.com's Mathematical Analysis will cost about $61.
Brasey says that students studying literature can often find the most lucrative prices, since many classics can now be downloaded for free, whereas natural and engineering literature can be quite expensive.
Look around you anyway.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN to find out the price of a book, as it ensures that you are looking for the right text.
Before ordering online, says Galt, make sure the book is actually in stock.
He didn't have that easy lesson.
The delivery of the book he bought was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the Fund for the Development of the Far East to be ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budgetary investment fund for developing the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits", the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary to create the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, did not approve the list of advanced development areas in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main objectives for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the region's transport accessibility, lifting infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, it is necessary to create the conditions for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to form advanced development areas that should become competitive with key business centers in the region, the President stressed.
We've been told that the advanced development area could replace the OZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone's "The Unstoppable 3" returned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing for" returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Home video with Cameron Diaz only brought in $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like How to Tamper with a Dragon 2 are also disappointing in revenue.
Film critic Robbie Collin's Telegraph article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 the "worst" year in history when it came to children's films, and called "How to tame a dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to the fantasy.
However, when it comes to movies that are aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day celebrations in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that the film's output this year is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the issue may be changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film "The Jungle Book", told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing".
We have to admit it and not try to go after what happened before.
Unlike the current drop in box office receipts in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from streaming services has reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "crash".
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy predictions were partly true.
With the release of several potential box office hits in the summer of 2015, including "Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Minjonov" and "Jurassic Park", other film industry figures are more optimistic.
"Human X" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in box office receipts simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history, and no one will worry about it".
Food sanctions don't scare the owners of caucasian and middle-asian food establishments, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And in general, the public has preferred to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella", says Italian chef Mariano Valerio, who is a chef at Barlotti, about the quality of cheeses offered by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan should be enough for a couple more months.
What do you want to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio's eyes are so clear that the shocking memories are still holding him back.
The meat was on the wagons only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
The rats!
I said we'd never buy anything for our restaurant in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, I got a fish from the Far East to sample.
So she turned out to be a deadbeat!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy are for a Russian manufacturer in a wild goose.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang out to become soft, to relax the muscles.
I did all this with local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that tender meat?"
I said, "It's yours, Russian!"
Why doesn't anyone do that?
Five minutes' walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge, there's a stop-list in the kitchen that lists the missing foods: French oysters, sea urchins.
Chef Regis Trigel, who cooks Brasserie Bridge and Arrow Bar, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: French oysters have already been replaced with Tunisian oysters, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
Regis, however, becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Coloured cabbage is 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, what's the basis for it?"
They say, "Well, we need to earn money, too".
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy far eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their armor weighs?
The price is a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of intimidation for foreign chefs.
The standard story is, "The first three months were good, then the quality dropped sharply".
The main complaints: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don't know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

The penalty menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are mainly called food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, poultry meat and meat products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
The restaurant has begun a chain of suppliers: the prices of food have risen, and we need to look for counterparts from other countries.
This will be most likely in expensive restaurants with monokines in France, Italy, Spain, where products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The community had to be rebuilt before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rossehoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier, American and Canadian beef.
Instead, suppliers started supplying beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in the summer of 2014 were much more severe.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that ban the production of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Valerio, the Italian, hopes that sanctions can be further relaxed.
Some restaurants are still in a state of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, imports accounted for up to 70% of the premium segment.
"Expensive restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce", says Sergei Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of Restkonsalt.
If the chef is strong, it's not a problem for him.
We've got very few cooks, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
The trigel from the Brasserie Bridge is ready for this: you'll have to give up 10 to 15 percent of the food, and the other half of the menu is recycled.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, steaks made of marble beef are already being replaced with beefstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentinian, Tunisian, Chilean cheeses", says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
Milk and milk products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seeds from Norway - salmon, seeds, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European-made vegetables and fruits can be compensated by domestic produce, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget network restaurants to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet.
It's going to be hard for the Ginza Project, he says.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace", Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing a lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes in the Caucasus and Central Asia emphasize that the products of the former Soviet republics are more flavorful than European ones.
But there are plenty of restaurants that are virtually untouched by sanctions.
These include Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani cuisine.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine", says Hatuena Kolbay, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and the "Vay Me!" café.
All the cheeses are made in Russia, and many dishes are based on chicken fillets, which we do not use".
Colba's restaurants haven't removed a single dish from their menu yet.
Timur Lansky, owner of the "Thaiхона N1" restaurant with Uzbek cuisine, is not embarrassed by the sanctions either: he will only have to change the lamb to the New Zealand one.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even gain in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
It is cheaper to get cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits from the CIS.
And what they bring in from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes, they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
After the sanctions were imposed, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artikov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants that responded to the money request are also responding to the sanctions quite calmly.
McDonald's' press service said the localization is over 85% and the network operates with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia Supplier Department, about 80% of the network's products are purchased from Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Termek, "sanction products" were no more than 4%.
The sanctions and the walker stick didn't matter.
KFC, Burger King and "Freak Potato" did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's localization rate is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian Far Eastern fish.
On his back.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that the increase in demand has led to prices even rising for local produce.
"The prices for the Grables have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - double", says restaurant manager Roman Rosnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian milk products have increased in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August".
"Brazilian suppliers have raised the price of pork almost twice", complains Sergei Rák, deputy general manager of Stardogs.
Chicken shorts are up 35 percent.
We expect prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will be up 8 percent.
"It's not a good idea to raise prices", says Cancer.
Statistics show that the general income growth for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8%.
That's the lowest since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it's unclear how fast: while most restaurants have stockpiled food for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the price to drop.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow city hall, there are ten tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, the musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival with a funny name, "There's Time".
"We were going to celebrate local food for a long time, but we were in a hurry to organize the festival", one of the organizers said.
Behind the scenes with the musicians, Greek cook Anastas prepares pasta salads and homemade sweets, and there was a master class on making caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organizers say.
In tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from the region, deer from the Sallehard, vegetables from the Moscow "Lenin's Farm", cheeses from the Italian Jay Clouse.
"Restaurant salmon can easily be replaced with other fish of the Far East", says Philip Galkin, owner of the "Svoje People" fish shop.
We have a snake, a caterpillar, a caterpillar, a caterpillar, a king salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as the Norway lobster, because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is a water crop.
You hold it in your hands, it won't even move.
And you can't keep our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without particular complaints agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic mozzarella .
In the window of his tent are shrimp with the "Magadan" brick, crabs, owl, mucus, crayfish from Crimea, and ridges from the Far East.
Galkin's convinced it's time to move on to fishing in the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 were about 800 thousand tons.
The "Svoje ljudi" shop has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, and before the sanctions were introduced, it served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
Now, Galkin has 15 more restaurants.
You can make the same sushi out of our fish, he says.
We got drunk, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are several times cheaper, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
I'm getting a Philadelphia serving with a ketha at Galkin's tent as a confirmation.
Unlike the seeds, these have to be chewed longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our native fish gives strength.
The site of the "Your People" shop even has coat and sea bass rolls.
In sushi bars, though, Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by saying that chefs are lazy to invent new recipes for Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us", explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Yevseev.
The situation is roughly the same with other products: Russian producers could take the vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to Boris Akimov, founder and co-owner of LavkaLavka, we can now talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are big multinational corporations out there with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can replace the prohibited imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit mainly the large producers of other countries", Akimov said.
But in the last month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
Following the massive out-of-plan inspections by Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are investigating the nature of the complaints to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible", the McDonald's press service said.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it's one option that you can survive", says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If they shut down McDonald's all over the country, it's going to be a very different scenario.
The 'European Protocol' instead of the GIBD reference
Payments by casco can be received without a GIBD certificate - this is how the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "European protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions, according to which from September 1 of this year to receive payments on cascading insurance the insured motorist will be able to do without the GIBD certificate.
It is true that the accident was only registered under the "European protocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if there were only two cars involved in the accident, no injuries, the damage is not more than the limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the payment limit for the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in situations where an accident can be reported under the "European protocol", the drivers involved in the accident cause the accident.
If you had a casco policy, you couldn't get a refund without a GIBD certificate.
The parameters described in the draft directive are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the implementation of the "Euro-Protocol" in Russia.
According to him, the maximum payment for a car accident without the GIBDD staff should not be lower than the limit of the "Euro-protocol".
But it cannot be above the limit set by the insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the police and the road.
But it is unlikely to be a surprise to car owners or insurance companies.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud that could be caused by the introduction of new cascading rules.
As for drivers, it's hard to imagine what work they'll have to do to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
Most of the time, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to get a small accident because it's more reliable.
And it's not clear which will be easier - defeating fraudsters or convincing drivers of the reliability of the "European protocol".
The savings certificate will be renamed and revoked
The finance ministry wants to ban savings certificates on the applicant, but it will allow banks to make them an analogue of a non-refundable deposit.
The finance ministry is drafting a bill that would ban savings certificates on the applicant.
This tool has recently gained popularity, as the stakes here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the depositors' savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and they are cheaper for the bank because you do not have to make deposits into the deposit insurance agency's (ASA) fund.
The situation is particularly acrimonious because the move is planned to be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and the Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the market, will be affected.
The Bank of Moscow's share, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the ASV explains, is that customers of a small bank who have purchased such a certificate try to get money from the ASV if their license is revoked.
Some investors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buy savings certificates from the issuer, may assume that their investments are insured.
The lack of a justified insurance payment on these certificates in the event of a revocation of a license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when the holders of the presentation certificates tried to collect insurance compensation through the court", - said the ASV.
The problem is, of course, fabricated.
After all, no one will pay the certificate buyers anyway, because they have no right to compensation from the state.
If the instrument were not covered by the A.S.V., it would also be prohibited to use metallic accounts where the citizens' funds are counted in grams of one of four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are not covered by the deposit insurance system, but no one is trying to cover them.
The fact is that the issuer's certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-resident.
However, the transfer of these certificates is virtually uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out, the certificate can be replaced by many owners.
It's no coincidence that the bill says that a savings certificate must be a denominated security that must be kept in a depository.
And to make the pills sweeter for banks, they're allowed to issue certificates without a prepayment right.
That's the analogy of a non-refundable deposit that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
The weekend was marked by protests by those who protested the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as anti-Semitism.
Stephen Fairclough was watching for us over the weekend and talking to protesters who had come from all over the world, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the militants of the Islamic State terrorist group, reports Itar-TASS on August 31, citing a decision taken after a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 "Milan" anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be completed by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs Merkel will address the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
Germany has not yet put its weapons in the hot spots.
The German population's views on sending weapons to Iraq were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that the weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia has hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militiamen have hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, according to the August 31 report of ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokin and Bezymennno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
Several Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats were shot down.
It is stated that the incident occurred today around 16:20 Moscow.
Teenagers picked up on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two Bushwoke teenagers were taken to a safe place by helicopter after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Gowts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party, including local police and rescue teams, was dispatched and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and cut his head.
Officers stayed with the couple overnight and picked them up on the swing Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met
The talks at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were called, but created a new format: the first people of the European Union met with the first people of the future Eurasian Union
Despite the alarming situation (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot issues" for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; it is clear who took the cream off this summit.
The questions were raised on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and other Eurasians with Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko on TV.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just knocked out a jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a high society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival of three major European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimacy of the 20-year-old president.
This is an application to recognise Minsk as a full-fledged European policy subject and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is confident that from now on, Brussels will not be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw", he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results have been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa simplification and readmission, dialogue on modernization", the Firefly interlocutor lists - and negotiations on international security with the United States.
The states even lifted some sanctions.
As for the events in Ukraine, they themselves and the Belarusian leadership's reaction to them have only inflamed the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure refused to recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militiamen in Donbass with all rigor, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and in Baranowice is located a Russian airbase.
Brussels and Washington have noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko's move towards political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will be forced to host meetings in the EU+TS format.
The press service of the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton's spokeswoman, Maya Kosyancic, only told "Ognok" that the issue of war and peace is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could be the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The key to Minsk's success was President Nursultan Nazarbayev's statement, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides do not object to Minsk remaining the central meeting place for meetings in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" is gaining the status of a handsome European leader who helps solve a global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The EU delegation itself, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, has already concluded that the main underpinning of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the timetable for future talks on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the TEC countries on the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, which was put together at the meeting, seems to be a bigger achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, noted that EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not the other way around".
However, it seems that the crisis in Ukraine is also working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all the mutual sanctions imposed by the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is currently under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuvering.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, former candidate for president of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus' opportunities to supply agricultural products to Russia in the face of sanctions.
At the same time, the supply schemes are being proposed, for which Vladimir Putin has scolded Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes, - emphasized Romanchuk "Oгоньку", - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They've been working on the supply schemes for a long time, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today those schemes are broken.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are about to start producing Ukrainian raw materials in Belarus, with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very demanding".
According to Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the platform for EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the EU's agricultural sector is estimated to have lost 5-10 billion euros from Moscow's sanctions, and the European Commission has only offered 125 million euros of compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president may propose to Brussels that they work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could elevate Lukashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that Minsk's official role in the creation of the TC+EC format is being discredited, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to meet, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay of barracada to make a decision, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time", he addressed Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic ministry stresses that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when it organizes EU-TEC cooperation on its soil, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is in the spirit of the concepts that our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, is promoting in other areas, particularly in the security sphere", said Ogyenka at the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, a department that has been scrupulously picking words.
Payment zones may be introduced in Moscow
The Moscow government is considering the introduction of paid-in zones as a method of combating the congestion of central roads in analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to Moscow's deputy mayor for transport matters Maxim Liksuotov.
One of the options that has proven itself is a paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made", said Liksutov.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and traffic, is very important to the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring road, Lixutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not have to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the round trip, there would be no need for transit traffic in Moscow", the deputy mayor noted.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking has significantly discharged the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, attended the laying of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
The fatigue is sinful.
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film City of Sin 2: A Woman to Kill for did not revolutionize the world.
The first "Sin City" (2005), with minimal but symbolic participation from Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" for modern thought (if we understand the universe as a noir thesis, and the cosmos as an antithesis of comics).
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
Sin City 2 is chaotic on both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar with the first "City", although, here, the grumpy Marv (Mikki Rourke), remembers, he died in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to pick up - as this folk drummer - knives and other axes with punches from the air.
But the old men are literally being slapped by the elbows of a newcomer, like they're breaking into a city from another movie, and the audience is being asked not to worry about the meaning and plot.
So, his story, shamelessly cut by the authors in the most interesting place, is with super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His is the lustful, frugal Eve Lord (Eve Green) and his revengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, wherein Dwight, let's say, faces off from Johnny -- especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are treated to characters with unrelenting regularity -- is not a problem, not even a half-hitch.
They're not human, but we know they're archetypes of Noir: a rock bitch, a self-confident gamer, a honey trap sex detective, a corrupt snitch senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and chases the archetype, it's not a movie anymore, read it's abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
Besides, even in this turbulent world, there is something permanent.
The war whores of the first "City" still maintain a circular defense against their native slums of dark forces.
And Detective Hartigans ghost is not-no, and he's gonna look at the fireplace, and Bruce Willis is always nice to watch.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is something else.
Frank Miller was good at combining comics and noir as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The modern comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, when Deschiele Hammett's novels "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the noir canon, which was then called hard-boiled school - "cooled school".
Or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood dozens of heroes: from the mermaid Popaya, the spinach-eater who gave him the power of a rich man, Superman, Batman and the mermaid Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "vengeors".
But there was something damaging about any comic book movie: the characters were determined not to become flesh on screen, they were still pretenders in the world around them, their wills and their wills.
Simply put, they were simply "deprived of existence".
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional romance - with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsayts, what Tibos and Rugan-Maccaras, what even the Balkans and Rostovs are imaginable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel mutated peacefully into a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet learned from his skin what it was like to be a frontline sanitarian.
He was a communist.
And, by the way, there were at least some Communist-oriented writers like Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors like Jules Dassen, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmithrick.
So the noir they've been asking is, first, rude and cynical, and second, it's purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first Sin City was remarkable for its unnatural, but organic, connection to the comic book and the noir.
For the first time on screen, the comic was alive, not embarrassed by its graphic nature, but pretending to be a "real" movie.
The darkness of a corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered the monstrous son of a sadist was well worth Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details of the severed heads that the sadist decorated his nest with, the feathers of the genius James Ellroy, author of "Black Orchid", and the best - that is, the most declaratively naughty - representative of the neon.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodriguez's radical style to the comic book tradition.
Probably largely because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second Sin City, you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow is sleeping the toy cloak.
Most of the time, it's not snow, it's bloodstained, but what difference does it make?
Well, there's nothing to talk about.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the edge of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can get a girl back on the wrong path or tell a discouraged parent that her destroyer is punished.
And when there is no sin in the city, except sin, then sin is no sin, but the rule.
Boring as usual.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the national lease gave this fresh sin a small but peachy.
The titles warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
The most vegetarian scene of a man's fingers being broken with his fingers is a hell of a joke.
Hammett would love it.
France's socialists must "shut up and bring France to order", says key ally Frasois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to "show warmth" to the attacked socialist president, whose changes were not approved by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him", he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put the wheel to the wheel by coming to the meeting of dissented members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marin le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying she did not imagine the new Wall government lasting for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but he is also a naked prince Manuel Val, forced to form a new government when the previous summer did not last.
"And the new one won't last the fall or winter either", Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win the early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU election in May.
A survey by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions by the end of Hollande's 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrinot, a political scientist at Siens-Poe University, warned that the French would lose patience quickly if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel something changing quickly", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City Without Drugs" is out of court
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court has left the discharge of the regional ministry of state property management to the "City without drugs" fund without consideration.
The agency was to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsk region's arbitration court left the lawsuit of the executive directorate of the Ministry for the Management of State Property of the region (MUGISO) against the foundation "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugene Roizman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7,3 million rubles as a fee for the rental of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision was taken to refuse to hear the case.
The reason for the absence was not explained by the representatives of the MUGISO Directorate, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The foundation's representatives were also unable to be contacted.
We are talking about a mansion that the foundation has occupied in the center of the city on 19 Belinsky Street on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Sverdlovsk State Property Management Ministry's directing directorate filed a lawsuit against the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded that the building be used free of charge by the government.
According to the MUSIGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include any significant terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Permian arbitration court, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which was not satisfied, and the decision was appealed to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court sided with the board.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, and the fund began to pay the rent again, the city's mayor, Eugene Royzmann, said.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles a month .
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, in recognition of our efforts to fight drugs, in honor of the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently", he said.
Tatyana Drogayeva, Ekaterinburg
Why did the mayor of Yekaterinburg want to leave voluntarily ?
On July 24, the deputy of the city of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosinsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city, Yevgeny Roysman, to resign.
The case was a criminal case against the arrested suspect in the murder of the pensioner of the deputy of the city hall, Oleg Kinev, who is considered an accomplice of the mayor.
How Eugene Roysman was found guilty
On July 1, a criminal case was opened (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugene Roysman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Department of State for Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Defense"" Anna Filatova addressed the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Roisman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg believes that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
They 'll turn the iPhone into a wallet .
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are all kinds of new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
Citing sources, American media reports that the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, Apple may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the launch of new products on September 9, which will allow the iPhone 6 to have a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves decline to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to make payments at the store's checkout using a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment by fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built into near field communication (NFC) technology for the first time, which allows contactless payments to be made using a smartphone and a corresponding cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced back in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the NFC Forum, an association for advancing this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - the Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link their bank cards to their Google account and pay with their Android smartphone.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investments made by high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
So now, the observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still make retailers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on supplying Russia with Mistral remains the same
French Foreign Ministry official Romen Nadal said Paris's position on the supply of "Mistral" helicopters to Russia remains unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: 'Today's level of sanctions does not prevent supplies.
This is the decision of Europeans, not France", Mr. Nadal quotes RIA Novosti.
So the French Foreign Ministry replied to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change of position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

After the operation, the losses and the causes of the situation will be released.
Those responsible for this situation will be held accountable", Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation near Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to a SNBO representative, "everything is being done to return the captured soldiers", reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that Ukrainian military personnel have withdrawn from Lugansk airport in the direction of the settlement of Georgiyevka.

Norwegian Cruise is nearing a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiating to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company with a market value, access to luxury cruise ships and Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources have asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises declined to comment, while an Apollo representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported $1.2 billion in revenue in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to be positively impacted in the coming years by the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The cruise line companies are seeking to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the U.S. regulatory authorities for initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's major shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 as a result of a merger with cruise operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 percent, Apollo owned 20 percent, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned 8 percent of the company, according to data from the end of June, according to the report.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents for the first public offering of Prestige Cruises shares.
The "Crimea" broadcasting company can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Russian Ministry of Communications is proposing to allocate 250 million rubles to the state-owned TV and radio company "Krym" in 2014.
According to the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, which is posted on the single portal of disclosure of information on the preparation of normative acts, the subsidies are planned to be spent "on covering the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
The money will also go to the purchase of equipment, the repair of the roof and energy supply systems in the building of the broadcasting company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists interrupt a Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly on Sunday set out a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong presidential election.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which will likely be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has prompted activists of the democratic movement to again pledge to stop the Hong Kong financial centre by protesting "Occupy Central".
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control of Hong Kong in June, activists for the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business center and staged a sit-in strike.
The briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communications Bureau in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People's Representatives Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists said they would meet at the head of government building in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land owned by the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities have announced their intention to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to the Palestinian Authority.
The decision to annex the land to South Bethlehem is part of a plan to avenge the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli defense ministry announced the seizure on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control on the west bank.
According to Gaza sector spokesman Saib Aricat, the world community should hold Israel accountable for "the continued settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem".
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the secessionist region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin's call on the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with an obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: To help the separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorussia actual independence to get closer to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state's First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return separatist-held territories in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the captured territories Novorussia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for the October 26 parliamentary election and as government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine to respect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were in the context of wider autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin's intervention to correct "false interpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to treat the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the population of 2 million are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing over to the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia's main territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between Russia's Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh amendments to the constitution that would allow the segregated regions to have greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who accuse Moscow of arming and inciting them.
Putin's latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed the rebels' new offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the formerly peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russia-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the beginning of a campaign to capture a strategic coastal area as far as Crimea.
This resulted in large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that had been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take specific measures; the leaders called for drafting tougher sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly being held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The naked photo scandal is gripping Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos featuring Jennifer Lawrence naked went viral on the Internet as a result of a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 candid photos of the star of the Hunger Games, Lawrence, and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Greco from Melbourne also reportedly had their photos stolen as a result of iCloud leaks.
There are 101 names on the list.
Edelstein, who made Greco a proposal last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hack was "embarrassing" and that those targeted "feel they were being invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her naked chest lying by the pool.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Strachowski and Forbidden Actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ: "This is a bold invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his anger at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Putting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different than selling stolen goods".
It's just, from a legal standpoint, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal naked celebrity photos has been discovered .
The massive hacking of the stars' accounts may have been done through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario for the development of events was described by The Next Web.
Github has published a Python script that allows you to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
The same login and password link is used to access the Apple ID as the iCloud cloud from which the photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed a passcode to be passed from Find My Phone.
This method consists of a sequence of all sorts of combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that the number of password options entered in Find My Phone was unlimited.
If the security system is set up correctly, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and alert the user of an attempted hack.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any messages about attempting to access their account password.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter user, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written with a scripted password selection program.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical of many services, but noted that he had no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, please RT.
The Prime Minister's Twitter account has been updated
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service before.
Hackers were seizing control of the device and demanding a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the cloud security was not compromised, but it did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked.
If the attackers had access to iCloud as described above, it could have stored the password to the head of government's account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to get any comments from Apple about the Find My Phone vulnerability.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-sport
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian sportswoman Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and appealed to the Federation of modern pentathlon with the request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cup stages, won the silver medal of the European championship in the individual event and became world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the newest programs in this sport.
She's still leading the league this season.
According to the rules, to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, she will need to obtain a special permit from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world in the shot put (2010) and the fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team , the athlete won the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the world championship in Astana (2013) and the European championship in Warsaw (2013).
The Criminal Investigation Service has stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RIC) has closed the criminal case over the crash of the Tu-204 plane of Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the airship and the flight engineer.
The court examination revealed that the cause of the disaster was an increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to perform standard procedures on board, as well as the accidental exit of the engines at increased straight-line speeds.
The Red Wings Tu-204 aircraft, flying Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 at Moscow's Vnuzko airport.
The airship went over the runway and caught fire.
The plane's commander, second pilot and flight engineer were killed on the spot.
Two flight attendants were taken to medical facilities, where they later died from their injuries.
Three other flight attendants hospitalized with serious injuries were treated for a long time.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the disaster on the Kiev highway, suffered serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transportation prosecutor's office conducted a search in Red Wings after the disaster, during which numerous violations were identified.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelianenko started training in the SIZO
The famous Russian mixed martial artist, 33-year-old Alexander Yemelianenko, who is in SIZO accused of sexual violence against a domestic worker, has recovered from his injuries and started training.
This is what the championship reports.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was placed on the wanted list, and was arrested on May 9 in Tambov after a road traffic accident resulting in a broken hip.
Yemelianenko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, and sentencing was set for September 1.
However, the trial was postponed, and the investigation insisted on extending the term of detention until September 30.
If the athlete is found guilty, he could face up to six years in prison.
What's the strength, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Yemelianenko's career
His last match was in January of this year, losing by technical knockout to fellow Soviet Union fighter Dmitry Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Yemelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, four-time world champion and seven-time Russian champion in combat samba.
Anger has proven to be the most universal and functional human emotion
Anger is a biologically universal expression for humanity, and every organ and muscle involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States have found.
They reported their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and a brief review of them can be found in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - the pointed and slanted eyebrows, the thin lines of lips, the swollen nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and even children who were born blind and never saw it do so, says lead author Aaron Sell.
In a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that anger is the emotion that leads to conflict.
The more physical harm one person can inflict on another, the more he has the opportunity to dictate his own conditions, and he reports it to the interlocutor through anger.
The researchers found evidence for another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and manipulative, feel entitled to impose conditions that are unfavorable to them, and prefer violent methods to peaceful ones.
Rather than considering that anger is primarily a "transactional emotion", the researchers decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create a angry expression should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - thereby forcing him to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers took a computer-based personality model of each of the seven elements of anger and showed them to the informants.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin did not make the face angry, the study participants unanimously acknowledged that the person depicted with these traits was physically stronger.
Human anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated display of self-control, compelling consent and submission.
A person blows his nostrils and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows or a baboon that shows off its claws.
"Anger is triggered by the person's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side's consequences of that refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of anger are arbitrary, they all express the same thing", said anthropologist John Tobey.
Ministry of Communications offered to allocate 250 million rubles to the "Crimea" TV and radio company
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization "Teleradio company "Krym".
This is stated in the draft government decision prepared by the agency, which "Lenta.ru" has been acquainted with.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover expenses to create conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment".
In particular, the allocated money is intended to re-equip the hardware and studio block, video walls, central hardware and video server.
It is also planned to acquire a mobile television station and satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of fiber optic communication lines (FOLL) and for the repair of the energy system.
The subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget, provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The state broadcasting company "Krym" was founded in 1959, broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television signal coverage of the broadcasting company is more than 75 percent of the peninsula.
In 2011, "Crimea" received a license for digital television broadcasting.
