The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The noticeable weakening of the two sides of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of current President Wilhelm Molterter seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Coroan hechtman Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it has lost 5.5 percent of the vote since the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP is losing almost nine percent of the vote, at 25.6 percent.
It is the worst result for both of these major parties in Austria's postwar history and especially for the populists who called an early election, a literally disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the populists had a significant lead in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters have clearly punished them for letting the government fail.
The first reactions to the results were speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such a development would likely pave the way for the increasingly likely outcome of the election, namely the renewal of a grand coalition between the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) gained 18 percent of the vote and the BZÖ 11 percent - the Social Democrats also expressed concern about a repeat of 1999, when the populists agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united, but split from the BZÖ in 2005) on a joint government that even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly the development Haider is betting on, as he has already said he is ready to work with any party and envisages returning to Vienna to national politics.
The Greens also entered the parliament, but lost easily and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties clearly crossed the four percent threshold and made it into parliament.
Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal insect collection in India is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the remarks in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee today.
"If it is not resolved, then yes, then a certain cooling-off would take place", he said after a meeting organised on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can't interfere in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Sváchy, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same comments during the hearing.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene is to provide "competent legal assistance" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've got quite a few promises", he merely stated.
The Czech judge of the battle for the sea floor
It will access a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
But what he's interested in is not a continent, but a little spot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as a continent", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, a member of the 30-member team of the UN Division of Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the head of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is monitoring the interpretation and occasionally adding to it.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a world so far little known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores, and other minerals can be found here, as well as previously unknown living organisms that may hold the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than land
Coastal states today began to bid fiercely for new undersea territories.
They are exercising their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, often extending several hundred kilometers from the coast.
It has exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its substrate that is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by a country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of years of preparatory work.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has examined five applications so far, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far", adds Mikulka.
The world recently received a boost from Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its submarine fleet.
But it also gained New Zealand - a seabed that the commission last week recognized is about a million square miles [1.6 million sq km], about six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The future profits from exploiting the seabed will be priceless, as they promise.
The request shall be submitted by other States in succession.
They can do so up to ten years after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a conventionally designated "common heritage of humanity".
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right to exploit in this area is granted by an international body established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a Klondike", says headmaster Mikulka, exaggerating that its "separate areas are clearly defined by law and their regime is contractually fixed".
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares them with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
It was granted the status of 'pioneer investor' under the Convention in 1991, as were investors from a few other States.
It is licensed to mine in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, which lies between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is spliced, it's some kind of underwater replica Tater.
"There is a total area of 75,000 square kilometers that can be mined.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev demonstrates one such concrete.
It resembles a small potato or, if you're a little fanciful, the mythical shell that legend has it brought the Golem back to life.
German special operations forces were involved in the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready but not deployed.
More details are gradually coming to light about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
According to the statements of the ministries, both specialists of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group GSG9 of the German police, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technical Aid Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were present at the liberation site.
However, according to a separate statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they saw signs of a forced release.
The Egyptian government has accepted the German offer of assistance as a support force for the operation on the ground.
"Fortunately, that did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted a group of travelers, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides, on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as were the details of their release or possible payment of a ransom.
Rescues are now in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the hostage rescue is being handled by the German embassy.
He hasn't commented on the details of the release.
There is no word yet in Berlin on when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper Bild, all five tourists are scheduled to fly off with special forces on one of the German Air Force's Airbus planes and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout package
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has narrowly passed a $700 billion financial-market bailout.
The Dow Jones index has plummeted.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government's financial-market bailout.
Despite calls from President George W. Bush and top politicians from both parties, a program to ease the chaos in financial markets has not been a majority.
The dramatic action was a desperate attempt to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged the lawmakers to vote in advance, even though he said the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political credit for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors' fear that the state bailout could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index rose, only to plummet again after the announcement of the package's collapse.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The program must be approved by both the House and Senate before it can take effect.
Travel agents report increasing bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism business:
According to one study, the number of travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly from the previous year - by over 30 percent during the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of Germans to travel remains unshaken.
Travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in winter season bookings compared with the same period last year, the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, there are already increased bookings for the autumn months.
According to DRV, turnover was therefore around 11% higher in October than in 2007.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluate booking data from 1200 German travel agents every month and integrate them into the overall market.
This result included bookings of tours up to the end of August 2008.
The dollar's weakness has made travel to the United States a major attraction, the DRV said.
On these routes, the increase in bookings is about a third.
In addition, the German public is particularly interested in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in domestic waters.
The main focus is on organised tours, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even during the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so the year-on-year increase in turnover will be repeated - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased from the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated drinks, beer from the bottle and celebrities in cuts from famous designers.
First time on the beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host, and she wears a tailored cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing we have in common: We're less than three minutes into the beer garden, and photographers are already pounding on us and filling up memory cards - a compliment, since I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap cut served its purpose.
I'm a tourist here, and I live north of the sausage equator, so my comfort level in the cut was pretty limited.
But as soon as we arrive at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The odd looks at the chocolate banana stand are only reaped by my apron.
A woman in Munich points out that I tied it wrong: "You're single on the left, a virgin in the middle, engaged on the right, a widow in the back".
I'm gonna secretly flip my arm around back to the left.
"Okay", he says and laughs.
Others, with their subtle flirting techniques, wear simple, plush hats that say "Drunk to get dressed!" and stick out their bare butts at passersby.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, from England, and he's also coming to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
He tells me after he's relieved of his ointment.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded "Wildbiesler", as Bavarians call people who urinate freely in public.
Others are not so fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the Oktoberfest grounds are swarming with paramedics who must tend to the poor drunkards.
The paramedics always appear in packs - four of them carrying covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to a beer garden: empty there, full back.
Who lies beneath the canvas of this coffin of gravel, you cannot see.
"Those are the ones who can't go on", one of the paramedics calls in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 60-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons widen
Long before Turkey began to seek membership in the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into Turkey's territory.
On the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, perhaps just twenty steps into Asia, stands one of the finest monuments to this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasa railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tour guide will tell you.
The building sits circularly at the end of the platforms with towers at each corner of the façade, looking indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one enters the vaulted vault, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was a late entrant into the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions for domination of the Middle East with this railway, which would lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from surrounding territory, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops were advancing from Egypt, driving the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news for Hydarpasa station too.
In 1917, an explosion on an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been steadily declining and history has bypassed it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territory, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To examine the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, where I was to meet with one of the AKP's leading experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a curvy ride on the tracks that resembled the Old World rhythms of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish consensus.
It has aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art stone and metal building purposefully built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and department stores, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy aims to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its perimeter.
Today, he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will surely come a time", I asked, "when Turkey may have to decide?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not wish to have to make such a decision".
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here has said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go east on these tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East may now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the harbor for the ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least back then, there was little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
The Bible is a book that is full of truths.
Mark Brown writes: "As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon 'Tod' Handley (obituary, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's musical plan, he established a year-long, excellent Proteus Youth Choir.
He was supposed to be 21, but by the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-shifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in whatever music was presented to them - whether madrigals or Messiaen, whether alone or with a full orchestra.
The musical adaptability of such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of one man and a passion for music that has remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How many times did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it then!"
His technique was clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
No matter where the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was a conductor to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "carried one or two leaky ovens around the world".
He will be missed by many of us.
I 'm not going to .
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to Oxford to study economic history and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... while studying for his BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's notes in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a thesis on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a research fellow at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff has crossed this stage of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend Jose Vicente Resina's exhibition "Flamenco and life", because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was fascinated by the simplicity and the powerful charge with which they affect the audience and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino has a way of capturing magic moments".
Honda is going to attack for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will begin selling the second generation of the Jazz.
If the single-seater's predecessor already had a lot of space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is complemented by improved engines that increase ride comfort and allow greater fuel economy.
It's more evolution than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-seater.
This includes innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
So the first thing you notice is the fact that Honda took a shorter time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a lesser known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million units sold in six years.
But Honda's goal is to increase sales of the new Jazz in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it is estimated that 100 000 cars will be sold, which would represent a 17% increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the carmaker thus de facto expects to end the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which is 4 000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this sales increase, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door, compact-size hybrid with a length of 14 feet [4.37 m], of which the Japanese company promises to sell about 200,000 units worldwide annually.
As regards markets, the Japanese producer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the USA, while the remaining percentage will be shared between the old continent and Japan.
Sales of the Honda Insight are expected to start in the first months of next year, once it is presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all dimensions.
Its length has increased to 12 feet [3.9 m], width to 5 feet [1.69 m], and wheelbase to 8 feet [2.5 m], an increase of two inches [5 cm].
The height, on the other hand, has not changed, remaining at 5 feet 6 inches [1.52 m].
The increase in dimensions also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved by using a new platform and by placing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used on the previous Honda Jazz.
The boot volume - which features a double-bottom system - has also increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the boot volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4 engine version, as the boot volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
In addition to the exterior features, such as LED rear lights and the possibility of a panoramic glass roof, the rear seats are more easily accessible.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of the Honda Jazz has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower CO2 emissions and delivers excellent powertrain improvements while delivering high torque at full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz - consumes 5.3 litres and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The engine will now produce 100 horsepower, compared with 83 for the previous generation.
The 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The "Car Bee" prevents collisions
To advance the development of accident protection technology, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has developed a robot that mimics the flight of bees to prevent collisions.
One of these is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision avoidance technology.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technical Advancement have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research at Japan's prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doie, general manager of public relations for technology, research and development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of Nissan's safety shield.
The robot's mission is to enhance the collision prevention capabilities of this brand of vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which closely resembles a Nissan safety shield.
Most important, however, are the bee's complex eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, engineers designed what they called a laser rangefinder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres in a 180-degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and instantly changes direction by turning the wheels at right angles or even higher to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all the maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, a robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, but is limited to two dimensions and the direction it can move in by rotating its wheels, not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as a bee.
So in addition to accelerating and decelerating, Nissan used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The machine only needs to process information every few seconds and act on that information.
It requires no storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, allowing it to operate without interruption with only two dozen kilobytes of memory.
It may surprise you, but in memory we're not talking about gigabits or mega".
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for instant collision avoidance, technologies that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would guide the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be admitted that the US Treasury not only has sufficient capital to distribute injections, but also has a great deal of ingenuity.
In the face of a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out risky mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, they created a popular online learning game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or the bad credit hotel... or the confused hotel.
The hotel and especially the front desk look gloomy enough to make you think once, twice, and three times about whether it's the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, though not very detailed.
It's a site more suited to the youth than the general public.
And what happens when the game ends?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley Banking House announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is joining its ranks Wednesday, issuing $9 billion to raise 21 percent of its capital.
A week after disclosing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price of $25.25 per share, representing a total of $3 billion.
The price negotiated is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG Bank is investing an additional USD 6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide a 10% return and whose exchange rate is USD 31.25.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the entire operation will be conducted at an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, were down 6.79% to $23.07 at around 5pm Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", explained John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley passed a new charter last week, which is supposed to allow it to diversify its operations, but also put it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest ace to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms unveiled on Monday among other things show that the deal has been altered over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's executive director in Tokyo, "we thought our participation would be purely routine.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise risks and also hedge ourselves.'
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% decrease in earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares within one year, provided that the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash flow.
However, a spokesperson for the group declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he's seen a "significant" decline in his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the Group, as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half while the insurance costs against the risk of default linked to the debt have risen sharply.
These costs reversed on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buyout of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Reestablish a republic around 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project by Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to a vote, following the example of his colleagues and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of the electorate, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted "yes" in the referendum.
The 'No' vote was 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were blank.
To pass the constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two exit polls and a poll by a non-governmental organisation predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with the margin between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, demanded the victory of his constitution bill on the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won all the way", he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at the governor's residence in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which the OAS observation mission said took place quietly, concerned a 444-point text promoting the president's "new socialism".
The draft constitution sanctifies the state's power over the economy by reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, sponsored by Correos, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and will be able to dissolve the Chamber.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will run for a new term in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution reinforces the principle of free health care and education, which the president has begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, he also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a launching point for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando unit has seized 11 tourists and their eight-member entourage, who were abducted 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were brought to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
They were liberated in Chad this morning by an Egyptian commando.
The hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft to al-Maza military base, right next to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken, without being allowed to speak to the press, by helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area on the outskirts of Cairo, for medical examinations.
"They are in perfect health" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said Egypt's Tourism Minister, Zohejr Garrana, at the airport's runway.
Since their capture on September 19 during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard, the director of the Aegyptous agency, a safari organiser.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces who approached the scene in two helicopters went on strike during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gun battle, half the hijackers were killed and the rest fled", said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces of the Lightning Unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, speaking from Belgrade, where he is currently based, spoke about the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must admit that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence personnel, of our special forces", he said without elaborating.
He also denied that the ransom was paid.
Earlier in the day, the Sudanese military said it had intercepted a four-wheel drive vehicle carrying the hijackers during a patrol, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-U), which immediately denied this.
Letters from the Ministry of Culture
The debate on cultural funding is making headlines and is a topic of ongoing election campaigns.
- The better.
But there is one area of our cultural life that is still being neglected.
Who will rise up to defraud the meager sums being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national monuments that starve to death?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the mere Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American people, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all county organizations, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 historical, monumental, archival and genealogical societies are working to uncover history, preserve a wealth of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a small fee.
Often these very companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who are desperately protesting as promoters and executives launch their bulldozers at old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we gonna get a grandstand for history and monuments?
The Benelux Government State-owned part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, the first in Europe to be in trouble due to the spillover effects of the US mortgage crisis, with partial nationalisation: the three countries will support a money and insurance institution, which also has a stake in Hungary, with EUR 11.2 billion.
The agreement was reached at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to enter a major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decision taken in this case could be considered to be a precedent in some respects.
Under the decision, which was issued on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its capital holdings, in particular the mainly insurance activities it purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis' stock began to fall sharply last week, and by the second half of the week, the bank was showing signs of a serious crisis.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to fail.
The company's stock dropped 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the company's executives.
The company's management blames the fall in Fortis stock on uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package.
The stock was up a little on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed as the bank's new head.
The FMI has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian Government has previously stated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
The bank's customers have not yet panicked and the bank's branches have not been attacked.
Fortis has a separate branch in Hungary and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of contracting with a drug buyer based on the information people have about their purchases.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that requires that the use of prescription drug data is always subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of an independent person, or we're leaving the chicken coop to the fox", quotes the Washington Post as saying of Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies make premiums and sums paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health of the claimants and, if the risk is assessed as too great, they do not even take out insurance with them.
Previously, they sent the persons concerned for medical examinations and only concluded the contract after knowing the results.
A decade ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: a pharmacy customer could easily see what medications he had bought in the last year and a half from an ID number, from which the program could infer what his illness was and what his health was.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this indicates that he has practically uncontrollably high blood fats, which immediately places him in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program, some of which also determine the risk factor, so that the insurance company has little to do but paperwork, although there are some minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
These are a significant risk-increasing factor for commercial insurers, whereas the first difficulties are not.
Special companies have been set up to collect and process data and ask the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
Now they are being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their negligence.
Some companies have recently begun to combine laboratory test results with data on medications used to provide even more accurate pictures of patients' health.
Data will be accessed by more and more companies, and at the same time, it will become increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
A bill that would give the federal government the power to control companies that specialize in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick recognises that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme to make the transfer of data subject explicitly consented to.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the permission in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not contract him.
So chickens are a little dependent on the fox's goodwill after all.
The global Marseille menu
EU-India trade to double
As the European Union and India are each other's main trading partners, this topic was also on the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other, mainly global, issues.
Today, a Franco-Indian summit will also be held, which will focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power which should be given a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have so far failed to find common ground on supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade turnover to more than €100 billion within five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the volume of trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this way, 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, giving the green light to future aviation.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The Summit also focused on global issues.
The two sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism in all its forms, respectively, and called for an early convening of a UN conference.
They also called for the end of the Doha round of trade negotiations, although both have a major role to play in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed, as did the need to reach a global agreement at next year's climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
The two sides also wish to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is on his way to the French capital today for a bilateral meeting to discuss a deal on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that French companies will be awarded contracts to build 20 billion euros of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the agency reports, the agreement is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A large number of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will take part in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries to take up 171,790 square metres of exhibition space with more than 430,000 titles on display, with Turkey as guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Deputy Minister of Culture, Francesco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony at the Italian Pavilion: Italy will participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia)  on 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A press conference will follow in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Hall 5.0, presenting the figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is still decreasing, especially in relation to children's and adult literature.
We've found the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The wreckage was discovered on a plateau at 10,000 feet [3,000 m] in the Mammoth Lakes region of Northern Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled any remaining doubts: "The plane has been found, we have sent a team there and we are now certain that it is exactly the one that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he told a news conference.
The sheriff's office has determined that no human remains were found on the plane or in the area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NSB) announced that hours after the wreckage was identified, an investigation team was dispatched to identify the plane: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes residence.
There are two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was called off a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has earned a place in history with a long track record of winning championships.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in a hot air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is a flight of 15,445 meters (15,430 feet) over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
One unusual SUV with an original design and precisely defined definite lines, wide surfaces with precise angles.
This is, in short, the latest born Glk of the "compact" Jeep house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of innovation to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional design that the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk will be unexpected and unconventional and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is the first to be used in Italy for an automotive brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses to be distributed near Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new SUV in near-real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, using innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, before folding back into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to attract future customers in this way?
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never made any big problems.
She's never even met the fans of the other team.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, a few) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-color flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: they were removed on Saturday evening to avoid identification.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc has made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all in the name, so easily verifiable.
And Viminale did check them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Dasal running, no one who was banned from visiting stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he takes action: In this case, Daspo can be given at least five years to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits you from visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also all of Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not set foot in any stadium.
Here's to happiness.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means more will be added to the more than 150.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not excuse those who behave in this way", the Viminale said.
So, "all eyes open, especially for the national match on Wednesday in Lech".
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, who can count on one piece of Aise, a secret service that deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"Chorus leader-leader and arms outstretched during the Mameli anthem?
This is the opinion of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very unlucky way), who for a few weeks has been the director of the Viminals Observatory (he has taken the post previously held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the quartermaster of Trieste, home to the core of Ultras Italia supporters founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I'm not a sociologist", adds Observator 1.
So far, this group has been kept within limits, so we're going to take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let us also talk about whistling in the Mameli anthem: it is not a crime either, but if you will excuse me, it is rude"...
